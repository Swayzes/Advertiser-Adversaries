Did you know that you can get the internet wirelessly now? Well, you can, and while it might be amazing, it comes with a certain level of risk, especially if you are using a simple password and happen to run afoul a person with a van full of RTX 4090s. Just how fast can a nefarious van dweller with a bottomless budget gain access to your precious shared network drive? The answer might shock you. Big shout out to Comino for letting us borrow this absolute leaf blower of a server, it's been so much fun to play with.
