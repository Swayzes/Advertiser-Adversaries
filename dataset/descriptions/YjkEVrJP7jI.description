We know you probably WANT a new computer, but do you really NEED one? Odds are good that, for most people, a brand new rig is simply not necessary. To prove it, we swapped our writers' sick gaming rigs full of modern hardware like the latest CPUs and raytracing graphics cards, for something a tad more...quaint. Specifically, 6th gen machines from Dell and HP. Will they be able to protect their jobs and meet their deadlines, or will the lag of old hardware stop them in their tracks?
