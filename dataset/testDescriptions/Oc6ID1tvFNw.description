Logitech makes a lot of computer peripherals. From keyboards for your mom, to keyboards for your gamer bros, if there is a category of product that lives on your desk, Logitech probably has their hat in the ring. And after creating some iconic pieces of kit, like the Logitech G Pro Superlight, or the MX Master line-up of products, it's no wonder they're a top brand in a space crowded with competitors like Corsair, Razer, Cooler Master, and many more. But is it all good? We build a full gaming setup using only Logitech products to find out.
