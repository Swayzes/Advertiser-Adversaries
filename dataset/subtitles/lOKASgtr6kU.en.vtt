00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.967
In this video, we're going to

00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.837
help over 100 different stray dogs
finding a loving home.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.939
Something
all of these dogs have in common

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.942
is that they were abandoned
or rescued from kill shelters.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.410
Some of them
would have even been dead

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.112
by the time this video was uploaded,

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:15.678
which is why we brought all of them
here to this massive dog sanctuary

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:17.976
to get every one of them adopted.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:20.520
And to show you
how serious we're taking this video.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.291
We have an army of trainers, walkers
and even an entire team dedicated

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.881
to giving the dogs scratches.

00:00:26.906 --> 00:00:28.495
Make sure they get lots of love.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.023
I want the doggos happy.

00:00:30.048 --> 00:00:31.551
And the doggos were happy,

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.409
especially once the first
adopter showed up.

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:35.549
Welcome. Come on in.

00:00:35.612 --> 00:00:36.312
What?

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.549
You're going to adopt a dog
even though you already have one?

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:41.741
Yes, we want a small dog
to be friends with this guy.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.642
And if you're wondering

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.711
where these two random
people came from,

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.640
we spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars on a statewide ad campaign

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:50.804
to get
as many people here as possible.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.890
- What do you think of Biscuit?
- Oh, she's cute.

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:54.621
If you're interested,
we can take them to the park

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:55.789
and let them play together.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.357
Yes, that would be amazing.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.392
- Oh, they're running together. 
- Yes.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.427
We love her.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.961
You want to proceed
to the next step?

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.496
Yes, please.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.498
We love her so much.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:09.335
One down, 99 More to go.
Oh, we got a runaway dog.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:10.470
We got you cornered.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.272
They're all cheering him
on. All right.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:15.183
Whoever adopts Rocky,
good luck, he's very energetic.

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:16.209
And something you should know.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.101
Every person
who wants to adopt a dog.

00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:18.954
Hi baby!

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:21.047
- All right you're free, Barkley.
- Oh, he's great.

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:21.815
I think we're going to do it.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.883
Is first put through extensive 
background checks

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.576
by an independent third party person.

00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:29.202
To make sure they'll be able to
provide a safe, stable and loving home.

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:30.889
- Barkley's been officially adopted.
- Thank you!

00:01:30.953 --> 00:01:31.801
Congratulations.

00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:33.206
And when the
next family came in.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.528
Let's go find you guys a dog.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.162
They notice a dog right away.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.597
Oh, look at this.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:38.327
He's ready.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.167
How many dogs?

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.511
As many as you can carry, baby.

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:41.643
Charlie and Nugget.

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.169
They're getting along so well.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.171
And after saying goodbye
to Nugget and Charlie,

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.587
things began to pick up.

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:47.492
Hi!

00:01:47.517 --> 00:01:49.309
I'm Karl, you want to meet a dog
instead of me?

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:50.712
Yeah, that's kind of
why I'm here.

00:01:50.737 --> 00:01:52.171
Chandler, nice to meet you.

00:01:52.196 --> 00:01:53.399
How's it going? 
I'm Jimmy.

00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:54.156
Hi.

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:56.166
You strike me as someone 
who'd like Brownie.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.423
He's cute.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.420
It's the end of day
one and eight dogs got adopted.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.398
But obviously, the cute, 
fluffy dogs are easier to find homes for.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:06.960
Getting all 100 dogs adopted
could literally take months,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.027
but at least on day two.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:11.360
Thanks to our ad campaign,
we had ten times the people waiting.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.226
Oh my God.

00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:14.938
Here's a
cute puppy you got to play with it?

00:02:14.963 --> 00:02:15.902
Oh my gosh.

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:18.571
The objective is to hit them with
a cute puppy when they walk in the door.

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:19.446
Seems to be working.

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:21.382
- I like this one.
- I love you.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.610
- You want to take Hansel?
- Let's do that.

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:25.445
There's so many people in here.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.407
I don't know what to do.

00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:27.523
Oh my God!

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.532
- I'm taking the dog home.
- Okay.

00:02:29.557 --> 00:02:31.050
There we go. 
Another one adopted.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.282
In case you're wondering,
these Xs don't mean the dog's died.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.875
It means they got adopted.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.699
I want both!

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:38.558
See if you can convince them
to adopt two dogs.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:40.326
There is a buy one,
get one free rule.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.262
- They're both free.
- They're both free, actually.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:43.229
Let's get these two.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.196
I think you are the one for me baby.

00:02:45.573 --> 00:02:47.175
We rolling, Rocky out.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.109
Chandler is introducing people to dogs.

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:50.770
Karl's hanging out 
with the people in the park

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.172
to make sure they don't
steal the dogs.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:55.083
And Nolan is the closer
and making sure they adopt the dogs.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.210
Plus, we have, like, 50 other people
running around

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.479
doing everything in their power
to find these dogs homes.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:02.916
We have a well-oiled machine running
and we will get all these dogs

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:03.583
to a loving home.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:06.753
And on top of that, every adopter
gets an additional surprise.

00:03:06.778 --> 00:03:09.089
So are you guys certain
you want to adopt Thor?

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.298
- Yeah. 
- Pretty much.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.767
Then I have a surprise for you.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.526
Every dog that gets adopted,

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.895
they also come with free
pet food for life.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.520
I should probably turn this with
you can see it.

00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:20.466
Free pet food for life
and pet insurance for life.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:21.568
Get out.

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:23.112
I think I'm going to cry.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.589
Do we get food for life?

00:03:24.614 --> 00:03:26.606
That does not
come with human food for life.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:29.309
Thanks to Spot and Jinx,
we are able to provide

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.474
premium pet food and insurance
for all 100 dogs.

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.376
Let's go!

00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:34.261
Thank you!

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:35.333
Which literally means

00:03:35.358 --> 00:03:38.985
free dog food shows up at their door
for the entire life of the dog.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.695
Oh, my God.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.614
Look at that.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.865
Thank you!

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.160
What kind of angel is doing this?

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:45.992
It's my friend Jimmy.

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.183
Well, tell your friend Jimmy thank you.

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:50.463
But that was when I met
this woman who really stood out,

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:53.808
having previously adopted
six other dogs in her lifetime.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:57.537
And so we took her to see some dogs,
but she fell in love with Zoey

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.471
right away.

00:03:58.471 --> 00:03:59.239
That's her, Dane.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.007
And she's going to meet Zoey
for the first time.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.522
Let's see if they get along well.

00:04:03.122 --> 00:04:04.597
The butt sniffs. 
That's a good sign.

00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:06.779
We need you to be extra nice to Zoey.
Okay?

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.047
Look at them running around.

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.941
Zoey is going to be extra
happy in this new home.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:13.255
And because now with Zoe, she'll be
caring for a total of seven dogs.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.220
How awesome.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.389
We wanted to surprise her
with something a little extra.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:19.192
We're also going to give you $10,000
in cash.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:20.059
Get out.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:22.629
As long as you promise
to give her lots of scratches.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:23.782
I do that for nothing.

00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:24.903
Now you're doing it
for ten grand.

00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:26.325
- No way.
- No problem.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.502
I rescued so many babies.

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:32.038
Because I just love them.
And they deserve a good home.

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:33.106
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.807
You're going to give her
a great home, we know that.

00:04:34.832 --> 00:04:36.651
And even though it was a chaotic day,

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:40.035
by the end of day two,
we had 44 dogs adopted.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.714
But we noticed there was one dog

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:43.316
who got passed up by families

00:04:43.341 --> 00:04:44.748
more than any other that day.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.894
This dog's name is Buffet

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:48.855
He only has three legs
because sadly, he was hit by a car,

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:49.756
which unfortunately

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:53.459
means he may just be the hardest dog
out of 100 to find a home for.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.495
So this is my favorite dog
over here.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:56.829
His name is Buffett.

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.808
He only has three legs.

00:04:58.832 --> 00:04:59.932
But luckily for Buffett,

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.234
we had a few new strategies

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.336
for tomorrow
because on day three we still had

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:05.471
over 50 dogs to get adopted.

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.404
So the first strategy we used was

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:10.843
I let everyone into the park
and unleash all of the dogs so that

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:12.345
they can choose their own family.

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:14.062
You got a camera
and you're the camera man.

00:05:14.094 --> 00:05:15.391
So beautiful!

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:16.602
Have you decided on the baby's name?

00:05:16.726 --> 00:05:17.647
We think Hershey.

00:05:17.687 --> 00:05:19.538
Hershey? Good dog name, 
bad chocolate name.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.195
Yeah, you can just jump in there.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.296
We won't lock you in.

00:05:23.164 --> 00:05:25.166
All right. You can't leave
until you adopt her now.

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:26.559
So what do you say?
You want to get the leash?

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.421
- Yeah, why not? 
- All right, arms up.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:29.996
- I'm just kidding.
- It's a perfect match.

00:05:30.468 --> 00:05:32.154
- You think this might be the one?
- Think so.

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:34.567
You want to go home with me?
She's too cute.

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:36.803
And since we were getting
pretty good at adopting dogs,

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:38.571
it was time to have
a little bit of fun.

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:40.006
Boys, what am I doing?

00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:42.567
Lay down and pretend to be asleep
whenever they...

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.562
Oh, she just came in.

00:05:44.632 --> 00:05:45.538
Hi.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.851
Stay asleep, hold it.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.749
- Is he asleep?
- Yeah, he's taking a nap.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.030
He just tucked him in.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.368
Now get up and say 
"guess nap time's over".

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:01.828
Guess nap time's over.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.366
And now go back to sleep.

00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:06.199
Bro they think he's crazy.

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.218
Look at her face.

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:12.138
But all jokes aside,
the good news is

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:14.140
we were finally getting more people
to see Buffet.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.753
Oh, he likes you guys.

00:06:15.777 --> 00:06:17.429
Buffett might be about to find a family.

00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:18.855
But unfortunately.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:19.979
Are you thinking Tanner or Buffett?

00:06:19.992 --> 00:06:20.959
We need to get Tanner.

00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:22.148
Do you want to take Buffet back?

00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:23.577
Yeah, I think so.

00:06:23.602 --> 00:06:25.030
And we'll go take a look 
at a couple more.

00:06:25.078 --> 00:06:25.627
Ok.

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:27.253
So we try it again with these two.

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:30.056
He's a sweetheart, and
he actually gets around really well.

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.238
But once again.

00:06:31.262 --> 00:06:32.325
So you don't want Buffet.

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:34.093
- I can't take him. 
- Yeah, come on good boy.

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:36.021
And to be honest, guys, 
this whole situation

00:06:36.046 --> 00:06:39.193
made us really sad,
which is why we spent 50 grand

00:06:39.218 --> 00:06:41.768
on a customized buffet
marketing campaign.

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:44.837
We will not rest
until Buffet has a loving home.

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:47.140
As you can see,
almost all the puppies are gone

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:50.376
because people are just not looking
to adopt older dogs as much.

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:51.878
And since that's all we have left,

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:53.913
the further we go, the harder
this gets.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.014
Some of these dogs are

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:56.849
from a facility
called a kill shelter

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.818
because they're unable to refuse
any animals.

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:00.420
They're often overcapacity

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.722
and have to put down their dogs
to make space for more.

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:04.857
But fortunately,
that's not going to happen.

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:06.459
And up next, we're on day number four.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:08.194
And this time we have Dave Bautista,

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.563
who you might recognize
from Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:11.164
Thank you.

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.432
This one's your favorite.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.633
She's so loving.

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.701
She's working her magic.

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:16.803
Don't give me that look.

00:07:16.828 --> 00:07:19.216
She's like,
Come on, why don't you adopt me?

00:07:19.241 --> 00:07:20.773
- You're usually the adopter. 
- Yeah.

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:22.538
I have four.
All rescues.

00:07:22.562 --> 00:07:23.419
Might be five soon.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.827
Yeah.

00:07:24.852 --> 00:07:26.515
Look at us, we both
look super defined.

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:28.381
With everyone's dogs picked out.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.750
It was time for Dave's
official initiation.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.318
This time Dave's doing the adoption.

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:33.757
Let's see how good of an actor
he is.

00:07:33.782 --> 00:07:36.882
Dave, when they walked in, bark
and woof to them as a dog.

00:07:36.983 --> 00:07:38.452
It's an everyday thing for me.

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:43.476
Oh, it's kids.

00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:45.998
Hello.

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:47.054
How are you?

00:07:49.241 --> 00:07:50.236
All right, you can stop.

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:50.937
You can stop.

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:52.271
I don't want to make it
too hard on him.

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:54.435
Sorry for barking.
I've been speaking to dogs all day.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.508
And we have a prize for you.

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:57.405
We have a huge prize for you guys,

00:07:58.302 --> 00:08:00.856
Free pet food for life, from Jinx.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.583
And we also have pet insurance
for life, for your dog.

00:08:04.608 --> 00:08:06.152
Oh, wow. 
That's amazing.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.529
But wait, there's actually
one more surprise.

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:09.822
There's actually one more surprise.

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.524
And then go to the beach painting,

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:14.030
turn it around and show them what
it says on the back.

00:08:14.453 --> 00:08:15.413
Do we get the picture?

00:08:16.272 --> 00:08:17.708
I hate Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:19.033
No way.

00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:20.462
Thanks guys.

00:08:21.283 --> 00:08:23.870
With Dave now part of the team,
we were adopting dogs

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.005
faster than ever before.

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:26.896
How's it going?

00:08:26.936 --> 00:08:28.456
Oh, they're so cute.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.276
- Are you taking both of them?
- Yeah.

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:31.410
You can't separate.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.379
- Let's go get the paperwork ready.
- Let's do it.

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:34.180
And soon enough,

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.884
we were approaching the final ten
and hardest to get adopted Dogs.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.750
Hi baby!
Yeah.

00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:41.680
Dave, you keep coming back to her.
What's going on?

00:08:41.705 --> 00:08:43.789
I have a dog named Penny,
and she reminds me of her so much.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.958
So it's already
feeling like we're connected.

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.227
I hate seeing her without a home.
It's killing me.

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:49.762
If no one takes her
home, I'll take her.

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:51.992
- If one adopts her, you'll take her?
- I'll adopt her. Yeah.

00:08:52.017 --> 00:08:53.199
I'm going to hold you to that.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.767
She's going to have a home
no matter what.

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:56.402
And it wasn't just Doralee.

00:08:56.427 --> 00:08:59.542
After getting passed up again
and again, by families all day,

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:01.749
Buffett seemed like
he was starting to lose hope.

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:03.643
But then something unexpected
happened.

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.344
Buffett seems pretty cool.

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:07.250
My grandpa had
a three legged dog.

00:09:07.275 --> 00:09:08.723
- Can I take him for a walk?
- Yeah.

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:10.816
Buffett seemed to warm up
to this guy right away.

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:13.344
- Come on hop-along.
- Someone might adopt Buffett.

00:09:13.369 --> 00:09:15.121
Buffett
had a lot of fun running around,

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:18.199
and this guy didn't seem phased
by his missing leg at all.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.126
So I've seen three legged dogs
do pretty good.

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:21.627
I'm feeling
really good about this time.

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:23.629
I think Buffett
is about to find a new home.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:24.830
You want to go home with Buffett?

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.899
Yeah. He seems like good dog.

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:27.633
And to ensure

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:30.736
that Buffett has the best possible
quality of life moving forward,

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:33.606
we also had a custom
prosthetic leg made for him

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:36.609
and were able
to give his adopter $10,000.

00:09:39.477 --> 00:09:40.713
Buffett found a home.

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:42.181
Now we got to get rid of his kennel.

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:44.016
Buffett, we miss you already.

00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:47.611
It's bittersweet, but it feels good
to finally take down his kennel.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.359
We'll miss you, Buffett.

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:52.058
It is now the start of day five.

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:53.793
Only ten doggos remain.

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:55.828
We've made
some very serious progress.

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:59.465
As there's less dogs, there's less
options for people to choose from.

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:01.789
So obviously this is just
going to get harder.

00:10:01.814 --> 00:10:03.543
And to kick off today
I brought two of my friends.

00:10:03.567 --> 00:10:04.904
Who are looking to adopt dogs.

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:07.373
You might know Neil because he lost
$1,000,000 in our videos.

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:10.409
You might know Dustin because
he lost $10,000 like five years ago.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.211
It's a lot better than a million.

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:15.748
And while you're looking for dogs,
because I've spent over $2 million

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:18.985
on getting dogs adopted, don't plan
on slowing down anytime soon.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:19.452
Please.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.121
For the love of God,
can I tell you about Surfshark?

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:23.606
- Of course.
- I'd rather look at the dogs.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.623
Surfshark is a private network provider.

00:10:25.648 --> 00:10:26.959
VPN, that lets you access

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.728
content
not available in your location

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:31.030
as well as browse the web safely
and securely.

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:32.498
Surfshark was also kind enough

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:35.968
to give this shelter $50,000
to help save more dogs.

00:10:36.043 --> 00:10:37.442
So you should watch this ad.

00:10:37.467 --> 00:10:38.380
What do you think of Cocoa?

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:39.972
- I think... 
- Here, tell me in one second.

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.541
Sometimes content is only available
in a specific country.

00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:45.578
Luckily, Surfshark has 3000 servers
in 100 different countries,

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.179
so you can watch movies or shows
that aren't

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:48.469
specifically available in yours.

00:10:48.494 --> 00:10:50.609
- Anyways, what would you saying?
- Tell me more about the VPN.

00:10:50.633 --> 00:10:51.311
I already did.

00:10:51.336 --> 00:10:53.219
- You want to take Jet out for a walk?
- Please.

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:53.819
Yeah. Let's do it.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.600
And with Surfshark's alternative ID,

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:56.522
you can disguise things

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:58.724
like your address, email
and phone numbers from hackers.

00:10:58.791 --> 00:10:59.525
You're free.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.467
- I'll look at them running. 
- Oh, my goodness.

00:11:01.492 --> 00:11:02.270
What's the verdict?

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:03.796
I love playing with this dog

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:05.631
and I want to keep
playing with this dog forever.

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:07.600
Good enough for me.
You think you're going to get Jett?

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.301
I'm absolutely getting Zeus.

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:11.370
Oh, his name Zeus now?
Good enough for me.

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.639
Did you know if they use discount
code MrBeast

00:11:13.664 --> 00:11:15.741
on Surfshark,
they can get up to 83% off

00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:17.610
and have six months
added to their subscription.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.644
Are you kidding me?

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:20.413
On top of that,
Surfshark has a 30 day

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:22.748
money back guarantee,
so there's literally no reason

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:24.417
not to install
and give it a try right now.

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:25.736
You're stupid
if you don't.

00:11:25.744 --> 00:11:26.428
Neil, don't worry.

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:28.054
You don't have
to share checks with him

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:29.755
because we have our own checks for you.

00:11:29.776 --> 00:11:30.782
Let's go!

00:11:30.806 --> 00:11:32.958
Eight dogs remained and 
we're going to go find them a home.

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.093
Jimmy, how do I cash these?

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:36.774
As we had hoped, 
as more and more people came in,

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:39.384
some were showing interest
in our older dogs.

00:11:39.401 --> 00:11:40.142
Is Dexter a shepherd?

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.534
Were you interested in a shepherd?

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.025
Yes. That is exactly
what I was interested in.

00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:47.073
We got two boys,
so I think we need like a girl.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:49.141
She's ready to come out.

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.843
Hello pretty girl.

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:52.244
So you made up your mind
about Dexter?

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:54.246
- You're taking him home? 
- Oh, yeah, I'm taking Dexter.

00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:55.681
I think we need her in our life.

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:56.415
They're so happy.

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:57.683
And so as we remove

00:11:57.683 --> 00:12:00.986
some of the final dog's kennels,
we started to receive video footage

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:04.290
from all of the families
who had adopted these dogs so far.

00:12:04.323 --> 00:12:06.484
And she's loving her new life here.

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:09.562
Cooper has been
a great addition to our family.

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.230
This is Hazel so far.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.032
She is doing amazing.

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:13.899
Hi Sarah.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.167
You got belly rubbed.

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.336
Good boy.
Yes.

00:12:17.892 --> 00:12:20.156
Thank you for the puppies MrBeast.

00:12:20.181 --> 00:12:21.707
And it was really beautiful.

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:24.710
At the start of this video,
we had 100 dogs that have been left

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.447
in kill shelters or abandoned,
but now only two remain,

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.898
leaving us
with Star Crunch and Doralee.

00:12:30.923 --> 00:12:32.618
And while people are
coming to adopt,

00:12:32.643 --> 00:12:34.722
neither dogs seem to fit
what they were looking for.

00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:38.086
- I was looking for a small dog.
- We don't actually have any small dogs.

00:12:38.447 --> 00:12:40.593
I was really looking for
like a younger dog.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.509
Yeah, no worries.

00:12:41.533 --> 00:12:42.871
Do you guys have any small dogs?

00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:44.263
Sadly, we don't have any more.

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:47.126
We were starting to worry
that we wouldn't find this two a home

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:49.201
and there was nothing left to do
but wait.

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:53.681
Star Crunch and Doralee.

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:56.475
Oh, How's it going?

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:57.517
- What up? 
- Hi.

00:12:57.541 --> 00:12:58.954
These are our final two.

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:00.479
It's like the last pick in dodgeball.

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:01.547
I'm going for this one.

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:04.383
Star Crunch can be incredibly shy
when she meets new people,

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:06.842
but Star Crunch gravitated right to him.

00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:08.967
- We'll call you Crunch.
- Win him over crunch.

00:13:09.295 --> 00:13:11.023
You're watching all these dogs
get adopted.

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:12.625
- No. 
- Doralee.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.434
And even though it was exciting
to watch Crunch get adopted,

00:13:15.459 --> 00:13:18.164
it was still sad to see Doralee
all by herself.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:20.366
Oh, my God. 
She's actually sad.

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:21.834
She's just realized what happened.

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:23.135
And now we have one.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.104
And we're going to give
whoever adopts Doralee over there

00:13:25.104 --> 00:13:27.106
an even bigger surprise
than everyone else.

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:29.842
And since she's the only dog left,
she doesn't need a kennel.

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:31.877
This entire building is her kennel.

00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:33.412
She's so fast.

00:13:33.412 --> 00:13:37.024
We made sure to give Doralee all
the attention the last dog deserved.

00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:39.051
As we waited and waited

00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:42.154
and waited
until finally one person walked in.

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:44.214
- How's it going, man? 
- This is Doralee.

00:13:44.293 --> 00:13:45.367
Hey.

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:47.860
- Oh, she seems to like you. 
- So pretty, yeah.

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:50.729
She was saved after being abandoned
during hurricane Idalia

00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:53.107
and now she's just
looking for a forever home.

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:54.233
I think she just found one.

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:56.034
But before you can take Doralee home,

00:13:56.059 --> 00:13:58.395
one person has to approve of it.

00:13:58.411 --> 00:13:59.614
I hate seeing her here.

00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:01.640
If no one takes her
home, I'll take her.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.541
How's it going?

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:04.710
I need you to give your blessing,
okay?

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.945
She looks super happy.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:06.597
Oh, yeah.

00:14:06.598 --> 00:14:07.464
Approved!

00:14:07.488 --> 00:14:09.363
I'm going to give him
the paperwork, take care.

00:14:09.395 --> 00:14:10.324
Congratulations.

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:12.414
Oh, I just hung up on Dave.

00:14:12.438 --> 00:14:14.161
He is way too big
for you to do that.

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:16.655
Congratulations on adopting Doralee.

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:17.556
And as a reward

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:22.496
for adopting the 100th dog,
we have $20,000 in cash for you.

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:23.529
Are you serious?

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:26.098
You have to promise us,
you will always take care of her.

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:26.932
Right here.

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:28.467
I have one final surprise

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:30.603
for the people that helped us
get all these dogs adopted.

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:32.004
Come on in.

00:14:33.535 --> 00:14:36.275
As a thank you for
letting us use your place.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.803
We wanted to make
a $100,000 donation.

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:41.447
So you can keep finding abandoned
dogs homes.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.948
We also brought a bunch of money

00:14:42.973 --> 00:14:45.175
for all of you that helped us
get them adopted.

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:48.187
Thank you Spot and Jinx for
providing pet insurance and dog food.

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.255
That was wonderful.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:50.723
There's about 50 grand 
in those wheelbarrows,

00:14:50.748 --> 00:14:53.518
which is extra on top of what
they made when we paid them to help.

00:14:53.543 --> 00:14:54.760
Thank you for watching.
