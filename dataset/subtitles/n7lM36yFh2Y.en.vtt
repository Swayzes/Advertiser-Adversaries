00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:02.430
(bright music)

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.230
- Yo, welcome to your first look

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.980
at the Samsung Galaxy S24 Series.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.420
And I think they're way more interesting

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.070
than they look on the outside.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.180
So we got three new phones today:

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.200
Galaxy S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.707
And as expected, yes,
they look very similar

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:21.510
to the S23 lineup, especially design-wise,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.100
but it's when you get under the hood

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.720
and especially with software
and the whole Samsung AI thing,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.010
that it gets way more interesting.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.300
So first, let me start with everything

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
that's physically new, 'cause
the list actually isn't long.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.390
So on the outside, S24 and S24+ are going

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.280
to look just like last year,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.470
same dimensions, same body sizes,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.480
the camera rings, the button placement.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.050
There's just new colors:
black, gray, violet and yellow.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.370
All matte instead of glossy,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.960
which I was not expecting, but I like it.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.010
And then it's squared off,
basically exactly like an iPhone.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.450
Now, I know, you know,
sometimes people say,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.760
oh, there's this feature that
kind of resembles the iPhone

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.930
or it looks a little like the iPhone.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.970
No, these flat sides and the flat screen

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.450
look exactly like the
iPhone all the way around,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.530
just being honest here,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.230
but now inside that body,
the bezels are again,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.880
slightly thinner all the way around,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.930
making way for slightly larger
displays on S24 and S24+.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.380
So now it's 6.2 inches and 6.7 inches,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.300
and then these panels
themselves are actually

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.700
sneaky major upgrades,
especially the bigger one.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.650
So they're both now a
ridiculously bright 2,600 nits,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.820
and the Plus that got bumped
up from 1080 p to Quad HD,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.100
and it looks like you do
have the option to use it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.030
at 120 hertz while it is
Quad HD, just like the Ultra,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.260
which I mean, that's pretty sick.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.810
It's 1080 by default, but
that's definitely an upgrade

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.610
they didn't have to do
and I appreciate that.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.160
And then the phones also have
slightly larger batteries,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.070
both of 'em, up to 4,000
milliamp hours on the S24

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.070
and 4,900 milliamp hours on the S24+.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.090
And then the big dog,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.060
the S24 Ultra is actually
even more tweaked.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.460
So again, it looks similar, obviously,

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.410
but it's trimmed up just a tiny bit.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.730
It's just a little bit thinner,

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.460
and then these side rails are now titanium

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.160
instead of aluminum,
whoever heard that before.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.360
And the display up at the front
is now completely 100% flat

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.700
from corner to corner,
and I'm really liking it.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.500
So you might remember we went from having

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.860
really dramatically curved
edges on the old Ultra phones

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.130
and Notes from back in the
day, to a gentle curve,

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.680
to almost no curve, but
now it's no curve at all,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.270
which means it's totally flat,

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.850
and there's actually much less
bezels all the way around.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.110
And the screen goes to the very edges.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.320
And then also the Ultra is
matte in all of its new colors,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.990
black like usual, but a new titanium color

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.210
and a violet and yellow.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.320
Then on the inside they're all running

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.380
the new Snapdragon 8 Gen
3 chip across the board.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.070
And then the cameras, the
cameras appear to be more or less

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.309
the same as last year
with the S24 and S24+,

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:51.180
but the S24 Ultra, they've
shook it up just a little bit.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.350
So the Ultra phone we've gotten used

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.520
to having this space zoom.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.380
So it was the 200 megapixel main camera,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.950
but then it had two
telephotos: a 3x and a 10x.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.720
But with this new S24 Ultra,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.030
you still get the 200
megapixel main camera,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.950
but then a 3x telephoto and
then a new 5x telephoto,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.090
which is kind of curious,

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.280
but I actually think it makes sense here.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.340
Basically the 10x is a huge jump of zoom

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.290
and I think Samsung is realizing not a lot

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.990
of people are actually zooming to 10x,

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.100
is just my theory anyway,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.560
so instead of having a 10x telephoto lens,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.540
which was only 10 megapixels,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.950
this new redesigned 5x is 50 megapixels.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.100
So the 5x, you know, that's a
much more common zoom range,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.530
and then the higher
megapixel count should mean

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.380
that when you hit the 10x
button that's in the camera,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.900
it crops into the middle 50% of the frame

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.390
and you should still have nearly
the same quality of a shot

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.910
as the old low-res 10x.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.880
Now, this is all a theory, a lens theory,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.410
but I'm gonna have to
test all this stuff out

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.120
and of course see how well
it works for the full review.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.220
So definitely make sure you
get subscribed to see that

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.210
when it comes out.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.043
Shout out to MatPat.

00:03:55.043 --> 00:03:57.180
Now, other than that, it
feels like it's pretty much

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.740
the same set of cameras across the board,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.840
and the Ultra that also still has

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.700
a 5,000 milliamp-hour battery

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.250
with the S-Pen slotted
in the side as usual.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.350
So if you want all the new
specs across the board,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.060
here's a nice little
chart we've made for you,

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.740
so you can pause and see the numbers

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.450
and the prices and everything.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.380
I do wish to S24 started
at 256 gigs in 2024,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.410
but anyway, we gotta talk about
this new chip for a minute.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.580
So all these phones are running

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.520
the new Snapdragon 8 Gen
3 chip across the board,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.520
great flagship chip,
beginning of its life cycle,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.170
so you know, there's a
couple phones trickling out

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.030
with this one now, and
there will be way more.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.500
And of course I have to test things,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.690
like the performance and the battery life

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.580
and how heating works out,

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.540
but it's also very clear
that Qualcomm has built in

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.810
a bunch of AI processing
features into this chip.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.960
And so now it's up to the
manufacturers who use the chip

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.430
to decide what to do with it,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.870
and so there's phones
coming out left and right

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.150
with all kinds of AI features,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.530
and I think a lot of 'em are
actually the most useful parts

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.970
of some of these phones, and
let me know if you agree.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.400
So the big one that I
think most people will find

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.540
the most useful on this phone
is the instant visual search.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.160
So no matter where you are on the phone,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.060
whatever you're doing,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.340
if you just hold down the home button,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.500
or if you have gestures, just
hold down the gesture bar,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.070
you can then either tap or
circle something on your screen

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.630
to instantly Google search it.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.340
And it's just, the few
times I played with it,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.600
it's really fast,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.420
and this whole visual
search feature thing,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.680
it's not like it's totally new.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.240
Like, we've had Reverse Image Search

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.660
and Google Lens for years,
but I'm loving the convenience

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.580
of just, you know, being on a website,

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.010
seeing an image or something
you just wanna know more about,

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.010
and then just long pressing,
Googling it real quick,

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.934
and getting the info.

00:05:36.934 --> 00:05:37.830
Or even something in your gallery,

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.900
you know, maybe there's a
landmark or something in a photo

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.970
and you just Google the image.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:42.900
I mean I think it's awesome.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.180
I think people are gonna
be probably using it a lot.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.950
It's also just something you have to spend

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.030
a little time getting used to,

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.250
'cause everyone knows you
can type things into Google,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.270
but to just visual search
Google stuff, super useful.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.890
Then basically there's a
bunch of other little places

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.380
in the phone where you
see the little stars,

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.150
the little barred stars.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.840
If you see those, then you
know there's some AI lurking

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.430
ready to help you out, just press it.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.740
So the voice recorder app gets AI,

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.380
so now it does much
improved speaker labels

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.320
and transcriptions, and
it can actually summarize

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.210
your voice recording after you record

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.650
into a bunch of bullet points.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.360
The Notes app gets AI.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.730
Now it can do things like
straighten out your handwriting

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.670
or turn your notes into bullet points,

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.140
or summarize your notes.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.390
It's just, you gotta find those
little stars and press 'em.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.730
And the Galaxy S24 Ultra,
it feels like it becomes

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.680
more than just the ultimate
note-taking device,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.690
but now it's even more useful on top

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.140
of the already borderline
magical handwriting recognition

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.150
and all that stuff, so I love that.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.550
The phone app gets AI.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.050
So this stuff might
start to sound familiar,

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.360
but let's say you're gonna
have a phone call with someone

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.740
who speaks a different language.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.910
It will do live
transcription and translation

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.580
audibly in real time as you're
having the conversation.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.320
So let's say I only speak English

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.840
and you're gonna call someone
who only speaks Korean,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.160
so you have to go into the phone app

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
and download the language
pack before the call,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.320
so it does all this transcription offline

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.450
with a model stored on the device,

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.830
and it seems like the
models are, you know,

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.900
somewhere from 100 to 500 megs each,

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.320
and when you get on the phone,
you just speak your language

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.990
and the phone will visually
and audibly translate

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.150
what you're saying for the
person on the other end.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.590
They hear their own language.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.260
Then they speak their
language and the same thing.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.330
You hear them, but then
you immediately hear

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.610
a translated version in your own language.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.510
And it's pretty fast.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.960
I mean, I've never used live
translation this smooth before.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.220
Now, I also don't speak Korean,

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.200
so I'm not about to vouch
for how accurate it is,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.090
but you know, I'm gonna
try this with Spanish

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.700
and try to verify a little
more when I review the phone,

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.430
but there's even the
option to not even hear

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.180
the other person speak, but
just hear the translated voice,

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.650
which is bold, but it also speaks

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.030
to how accurate they think it is.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.390
And then of course the photo app gets AI.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.910
This one's not a shocker, but
it's also kind of shocking

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.360
how close it is to some other
things that we've seen before.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.860
So once you have a photo,

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.350
you hit the info button with the stars,

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.120
and you can do a couple simple things

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.770
like add background blur

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.990
or erase an object in the background

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.720
or remaster a photo, which
seems like it's just doing

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.510
some color and lighting and
balance tweaks automatically.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.800
That's cool. It works.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.870
I think a lot of people will
just find that stuff useful

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.750
right off the bat, but once
you go into the editor,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.730
you'll see in the bottom left hand corner

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.190
a familiar group of stars that are back.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.908
It's literally a full on magic
editor, just like the Pixel.

00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:31.170
(laughs) So you jump in
there, you can circle things,

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.730
highlight things to move around,

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.680
and of course it's even
more precise with the S-Pen,

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.840
but then it literally does the same thing.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.210
It takes a few seconds to
generate to fill the background,

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.700
it plays a nice little animation,
and then when it's done,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.760
it's spits out a few
options of a new photo

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.490
that is just completely fake.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.070
And also, I don't know, there
seems to be less restrictions

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.780
with this one than Google's, at least,

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.850
because I remember the
Pixel was very picky

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.650
about letting me move people around,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.900
but I encountered nothing that this one

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.220
was not willing to mess with,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.440
so the good thing is in the final result,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.000
there is a baked in watermark

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.500
at the bottom left-hand corner.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.780
So you'll know in your gallery
if you're looking at an image

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.640
that has those stars as a watermark,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.010
that it didn't actually look
like that when you captured it.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.950
And you can also apparently
turn a regular video

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.950
into a slow motion video as
the AI generates new frames

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.510
in between actually captured frames,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.950
and that can slow down the video for you.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.270
I don't know how well that's gonna work.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.320
Again, if it's as good

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.510
as some of the generative
AI stuff I've seen,

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.040
could be shockingly good,

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.750
but that's just another AI feature.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.540
Either way, clearly
there's a lot going on.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.770
Now, it's kind of funny.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.354
Bixby (laughs) is like
sort of the main character

00:09:38.354 --> 00:09:41.820
of AI on Samsung phones in the past,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.520
and I don't really see any
indication that Bixby itself

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.320
is actually taking big leaps forward.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.310
It's still on the phones.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.260
It still works, but we'll have to see.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.093
I'm gonna test that.

00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:51.720
I gotta test how good these screens are,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.180
how well these new cameras
work, and all that stuff.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.710
And maybe there's some
other stuff buried in

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.030
that I haven't found yet

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.760
that isn't just blatantly
copying Apple's homework.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.440
And also, if you want your phone to look

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.670
at least a little different,

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.200
I checked with channel sponsor dbrand,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.760
and they confirmed that
they're ready to go

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.100
with the Grip Case shipping
around the same time

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.140
that Samsung will be
shipping out these phones.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.460
One thing I've always
liked about the Grip Case

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.100
is they actually individually
do the precise cutouts

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.030
of the camera lenses

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.220
instead of just one
big lazy window cutout.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.580
Oh and bonus, they added
MagSafe compatibility this year

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.780
for the S24 series.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.120
So if you want a clean, protective,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.460
matte black magnetic case,

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.780
well, that links in the description.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.030
Either way, let me know what
you think of these new phones

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.266
and let me know what you
wanna see in the full review.

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:34.500
(smooth music)
Some interesting stuff here,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.460
I'll say that.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.310
Thanks for watching,
catch you in the next one.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.143
Peace.

00:10:40.151 --> 00:10:43.010
(smooth music continues)
