00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.469
I've built a massive
isolation chamber

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:06.072
and we're going to see
if these two strangers

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:09.542
can survive in this cube
for the next 100 days.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.678
They have never met each other ever.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.480
Bailey. This is Suzie.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.215
- Suzie, this is Bailey.
- Nice to meet you.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:16.383
Hi! Nice to meet you.

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:19.185
If the two of you can survive
the next 100 days in here.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.489
I will give you the half a million
dollars inside of this vault.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:26.926
But if one of you leaves before the 100
days is up, you both get nothing.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.662
All right. I think you
guys understand the rules.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.665
- Have fun.
- Okay. Bye.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.334
This is going to be crazy.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:40.407
Yeah.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.976
This is actually like an insane
asylum.

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.211
They're currently looking at all
the stuff we put in there.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.646
We gave them enough food
for 100 days,

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.082
which is healthy,
but basically the exact same thing

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.550
over and over again.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.751
We also gave them their own

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.787
private bathroom,
which comes with the shower

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.723
and obviously has no cameras inside
and a bed to sleep on.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.025
They have everything
they need to survive 100 days.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.127
It's just a question of do
they want it?

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:04.531
I got a comb. I don't know if
I've ever combed my hair in my life.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.299
Interesting.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.301
See how they're both standing
on different sides of the room?

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.335
They're so awkward.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.037
When I had them
take their blindfolds off.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.140
That was legitimately
the first time they had ever met.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.710
I just keep thinking of the feeling
like

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.079
of exiting.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:19.612
Oh, yeah?

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.748
How good is that going to feel?

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:27.153
It's only a 100 sleeps.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.054
Only 100 sleeps.

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.256
And then the world will have just
kept going.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.393
That's like, what freaks me out.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.829
The most interesting
part of this experiment is that

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.332
in this room, you have no idea
what day or time it is.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.967
And already night one.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:44.571
Suzie and Bailey made the mistake
of only sleeping for 2 hours,

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:49.209
which means they started
their second day at 2:37 a.m.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.978
I'm just going to just act like
this is just the new normal.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.547
- Okay, what do you want to eat?
- Are you feeling beef or chicken?

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.916
- Chicken.
- Chicken sounds great.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.453
That is sickening.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.124
It's good.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.161
As you can see, living inside
a white cube is pretty boring.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.462
Besides eating the same thing

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:12.599
over and over, time in the chamber
consisted of two things

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.400
trying to hide
from the bright light.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.937
The lights are just so bright,
that we have to make these things

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:18.938
to shield ourselves.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:19.873
 And desperate attempts

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.274
to keep themselves entertained.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.710
Like on day four,
when they use the paper

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.246
from their journals
to make a deck of playing cards.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.214
Is he making... Cards?

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.682
All right.
So I just finished my deck of cards.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.151
I think that they actually
 came out all right.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.752
Which honestly looked pretty fun.

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:35.855
So I made myself a $30,000 seat
and joined it.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.629
On day five,
they made a sign in sheet,

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.697
which was really just
an elaborate trick.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:45.265
What is it?

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.233
You have to sign our sign in sheet.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.401
Oh, these are our camera people.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.303
Yeah, this is everyone
 that's come in today.

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:51.337
Wait a minute.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:52.338
You're having them do this

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.108
so you can track the date
and the time.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.609
Hold up, I need to borrow this.

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:58.011
No, no, I wrote the date.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:58.811
I wrote the date.

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.580
Which I got to say was pretty smart.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.348
But by the time we got to day seven,

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:05.218
anything considered
smart was thrown out the window.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.686
Bailey's lost it.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.223
He's whipping the pork.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.158
Yeah.

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.427
The veggies never stood a chance.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.329
Five more throws.

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.431
But I only need one.

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.133
Let's freakin go, baby.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.602
It's actually crazy to me
that already on day 9

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:26.472
of this challenge, they're
bored enough to expose the red line

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:30.043
that if they cross, they lose
every dollar of their prize money.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.579
It is now day number ten.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.546
How you doing, Nolan?

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:34.314
Good.

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:36.015
And I got a pretty
interesting offer.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:36.950
What is it?

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:43.323
So it looks like they took
the $500,000 and put 250 on her side

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:46.559
and 250 on his to remind themselves
of what's at stake.

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.929
The whole door
opening thing is so dramatic.

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:50.730
How's it going?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.299
We're about to reveal the most
interesting part of the challenge.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.201
I need you two to just face this wall.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.904
They don't even know
that there's a door back here.

00:03:57.937 --> 00:03:59.172
Let's do this.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.780
This is their first time seeing
the outside world in 10 days.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.683
You are kidding me.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.385
The sky.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.520
Every ten days,
I will give you something

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.788
that will make the challenge easier.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.156
But if you actually want it,

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.359
you have to pay for it
with some of your prize money.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.526
And first, for day ten,

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.662
we're going to give you
the option to buy a private chef

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:24.664
that'll cook you
whatever you want between now

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:26.733
and the end of the challenge
for $50,000.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:27.934
Before you answer,

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.769
if you want to give up
some of your prize money,

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:30.970
we're gonna let
you have a nice meal.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.972
Use this as a floor
for your imagination

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:35.975
as to what you could be eating for
90 more days.

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:38.011
You are kidding me.

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.412
50 grand a lot, though.

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:40.647
Okay, let's not think about it
right now.

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:43.049
These look like some people
that have only canned chicken

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:43.950
for ten days.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.819
I love just looking at the sky.

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:49.989
You forget that they literally
haven't seen the sun in 10 days.

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:50.923
Now I feel bad.

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:53.192
After eating this,
the thought of that food

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:54.761
is like grossing me out even worse.

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:55.595
It's rough.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.864
They're starting to talk about
whether they should take it.

00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.932
- I don't know what to do.
- I don't either.

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:02.502
This is a good first one to tempt us
with.

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:03.903
- Oh, no.
- Hey Jimmy.

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:06.072
All right.
It's time for the decision.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.743
Would you pay $50,000 to have this
for the rest of the challenge?

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.246
- Nope.
- I think we decided no.

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:13.846
Really?

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:16.149
I honestly didn't
think you guys would say no.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.984
- Oh, no, no.
- Oh, my God.

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:20.687
I have another offer in ten days.

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:21.921
We'll see if you cave, then.

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:23.756
I really thought
you were going to say yes.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.558
- That was crazy.
- Bye.

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:28.127
 I'm really curious about
what the next temptation is.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.796
I know,
but you know what?

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.164
I'm proud of us
for staying strong.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.964
Good job.

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:33.466
And now, with the chef gone,

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.968
it seemed like Suzie
and Bailey were already starting

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:37.270
to regret their decision.

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:38.104
Bon appétit.

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:39.939
My favorite part is
that you can hold it sideways,

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:42.241
And it stays on the plate.

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:45.244
The next few days were
pretty mind-numbing for the both of them.

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:48.081
Their routine consisted
of waking up, cooking food,

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.216
and then eventually
just going back to sleep.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:51.884
Man, the longer I'm in here,

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:55.021
the more I feel like I'm sharing
a space with an annoying sibling.

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:56.689
Are you talking about me?

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.691
Who else?

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:01.527
And even though they were getting
used to each other, one thing

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:04.630
they weren't getting used to were
the constant beaming lights.

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:05.865
It's just so bright in there.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.601
I came in the bathroom because
the light, you can keep it off.

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.303
So it's nice and like dark in here.

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:15.174
Once it gets super late at night,
I physically feel my eyes stinging

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:17.477
just because of how bright
the lights are in here

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:20.313
and because it was so hard
for them to get any sleep.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:22.882
I had the perfect offer
planned for day 20.

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:27.186
Congrats, you're 20% done.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.721
Are you two ready for the offer?

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:29.655
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:31.924
Your day 20 offer is simple.

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:34.627
I will give you each a smart bed
that are super comfortable

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:37.830
and combined will cost
$50,000 of your prize money.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.898
I will also give you this iPad

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:41.100
with the ability
to turn off the lights.

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:42.335
Dang.

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:44.804
They have exactly one hour
to decide if they want to spend

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:48.007
$50,000 of their prize money
for these beds

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.342
and the ability to turn off the lights.

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:51.110
The answer might be yes.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.913
I haven't seen Suzie this happy
since we literally started

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:54.313
the challenge.

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:57.750
Let's remember what we would have
to live with if we don't say yes.

00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.385
Oh, my gosh.

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:01.721
Oh, my gosh.

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:03.623
I think they're going to take it.

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:05.391
I think we should.

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.026
It's only 10% of our money.

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:08.928
It's decision
time.

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:11.597
Your 1 hour is up.

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.533
This is what
your eyeballs could have.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:15.868
But if you say no,
this is what you're stuck with

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.970
for 80 days straight.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.238
Do you want this comfortable beds?

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:20.606
I'm actually okay with whatever you say.

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:22.909
- Five, four.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.277
- Three.
- I’m happy with whatever you say.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.913
- Two, one.
- Bailey, yes or no? Bailey, yes or no?

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:29.549
What's your decision?

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:31.484
No.

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:32.919
Really?

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.888
Ok... Wow.

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:38.691
I did not see that one coming.

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:41.060
I think I made a mistake, maybe.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.395
Oh, what a heavy mistake.

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:44.630
I cannot believe you guys said no.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.299
I'll leave you alone
for a couple of days.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.934
I hope you don't regret
your decision.

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:49.435
- Bye
- Bye.

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:50.970
I think we made the right decision.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.305
I can't believe that

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.240
in the heat of the moment
you said no.

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.843
I feel that slight regret right now.

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:57.810
I don't.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.213
I feel no regret in your decision.

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:06.452
So today I made my calendar,
and I was just writing

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:07.954
my mom's birthday.

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:09.889
It's going to
be tough on that day, I think.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.163
I'm so bored.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.397
I think that we're hitting a point

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:20.633
where boredom is
like at a all-time high.

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.669
I woke up this morning
and didn't feel like doing anything,

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.438
so I just sat there and stared.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.242
What are you going to do with this money?

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:31.577
I have a house, I was probably
going to pay a lot on the house.

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:32.945
Oh, that's awesome.

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:35.281
I want to pay off my parents debt.

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:37.183
That would be like my ideal world.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.251
Throughout the following days,

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:40.319
I made sure to not interrupt
the routine.

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:42.622
However,
I was also taking note of things

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:44.290
they missed from the outside world,

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.827
like on day 24 when I overheard them
wanting seasoning on their food.

00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:52.532
Okay, if we add seasoning, I can
easily stay here a hundred days.

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:55.001
On day 27, Suzie was craving coffee.

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:59.272
I am a big coffee
drinker and I only have water.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:02.475
And on day 28, Bailey clearly needed
entertainment.

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:05.845
So by day 30

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:08.281
I had the perfect plan
to get them to spend money.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.550
It's now day 30 and
it's time for another offer.

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.485
- How's it going?
- Hi.

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:13.853
Today's offer is simple.

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:16.188
Each of these five items
cost $10,000.

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:19.625
You can buy one phone call,
the entire Harry Potter collection,

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:22.895
your own coffee machine, spices,
salt and pepper for your food.

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.064
Or you can buy a monopoly
for $10,000.

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:27.133
You could buy one of them.
You can buy all five of them.

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:29.735
This is tough, actually.
You have 10 minutes to decide.

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:30.803
Just let me know what you want.

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:31.637
I'm so nervous.

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:33.673
- This is a big decision.
- Coffee?

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:36.442
- It does sound kind of nice.
- It does.

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:38.644
- And then the seasoning.
- Seasoning sounds nice too.

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:41.247
I'm doing this one
1,000% I'll be honest with you.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.715
I don't really care about that.

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:43.215
Sick.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:44.784
Coffee would be nice,

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:46.419
as like a treat every morning.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.120
I've made my mind up.

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:49.422
Decision time.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.524
Are you buying Monopoly?

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:52.091
- No.
- No.

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:52.858
Gone.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.194
Are you buying the spices?

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:56.195
- No.
- No.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.265
Are you buying the coffee?

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.133
Does it come with cream or sugar?

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.535
If you say yes in 3 seconds.

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:05.104
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:07.640
Yay Coffee!

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.141
Are you buying
the Harry Potter books?

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:09.709
Yes.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:12.678
Are you buying the phone calls?

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:13.613
- No.
- No.

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:17.650
We finally got you two to buy something.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.952
This feels good.
It was a pleasure doing business.

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.220
Thanks for taking your money.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.422
Most expensive coffee
maker in the world.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.558
30 days in, we got something
new, that's exciting.

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:27.059
We caved. You're welcome.

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:28.060
That's my closet.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.362
That's my bookshelf.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.263
I could stay another 70 days easy.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.200
And we still have $480,000 It’s crazy.

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:35.468
Over the next few days.

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:36.602
Not a lot happened.

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:39.071
- She's already preparing a meal.
- It's like being married.

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.539
The most interesting thing was
when

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:43.442
hurricane Idalia
took out the power on day 34.

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.878
- Oh, no way.
- No way.

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:48.514
As you can imagine,
our cameras became pretty useless.

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:51.951
So I'm
just going to take you to day 39.

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:52.952
How's it going?

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:53.719
- Hello?
- Hi.

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:54.553
Hey.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.522
I know
you guys have been struggling.

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:57.890
I'm sorry it took so long.

00:10:58.891 --> 00:10:59.859
Hold up.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.694
Oh there we go.

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.229
That was a long delay.

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:05.731
You should be able to use
your coffee pot again, cook food.

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:06.966
You should have a hot shower.

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:07.833
That's excellent.

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.201
I'll see you tomorrow
with the surprise.

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:10.302
Oh, I'm so excited.

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:12.571
The power's on.

00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:13.739
Look, it's light.

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.274
Like it feels like cheerier.

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:17.143
The lights are back on again.

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:20.346
I just had a hot meal, hot shower.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.182
Life is finally looking up here.

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:25.184
There's now day 40.

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:27.720
- Can I come in?
- Come in.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.790
Your gift at no expense is this TV.

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:33.859
But every single movie is $10,000
a pop.

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:36.028
You have one hour to decide.
Have fun.

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:38.064
This is crazy.
The amount of movies in here.

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:41.100
We can watch this documentary about Nolan.

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:43.302
We left Suzie and Bailey
to discuss the offer

00:11:43.302 --> 00:11:46.272
and told them we'd be back later,
but they didn't seem too interested.

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:47.707
How about ten grand for all?

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.042
I'll go ahead and tell you now, no.

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:53.612
You might as well just come in here,
because I think we both are

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:55.648
set in our ways.

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:56.315
Okay.

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:58.684
The best I could do
is buy one, get one half off.

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:01.320
Can't do it.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.655
All right gang, come on in.

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:03.989
Take every last one.

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:05.357
I'll gladly keep this.

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:08.194
Not any of the Hunger Games?

00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:10.629
I left the TV in the chamber
to remind Suzie and Bailey

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:11.564
of what they could have had.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.200
But little did I know
they were going to outsmart me.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.668
An antenna is just a piece of metal.

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:17.470
Rip this little wire off the wall.

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:21.807
So I had to take this knife
so that the wire is, like, frayed.

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:24.410
I literally just plugged it
into the antenna spot.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.978
Now we're going to see if it works.

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:26.912
Just anything.

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:27.913
Give us one channel.

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:29.982
What?

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:31.951
It says that there's seven digital
channels.

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:32.752
Oh, my gosh.

00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:34.086
If this actually works...

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:37.790
Wait.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.358
- I'm like actually shaking.
- Bailey!

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:41.227
Currently the only thing
that we can get on the TV

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.394
is a race car race.

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:44.597
- Never really been a fan.
- Oh, he's in second.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.467
But today, all of a sudden, we're
huge race car fans.

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.903
Our time is going to fly by.

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:53.672
And Suzie was right
because for the next six days,

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:54.940
that's all they did.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.912
Having the TV
feels like we're in purgatory.

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:02.148
It's like almost normal life.

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:05.151
It is my mom's birthday tomorrow,
even though I won't be able

00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:06.519
to spend the day with her.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:10.022
I got some time in here to make her
a little birthday present.

00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:12.992
Although I didn't go out and buy
something, I'm technically

00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:14.160
spending money on it.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.863
Tomorrow is day 50,
so I'm going to use toilet paper

00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:21.433
to do streamers
and decorate the room.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.171
It's day 50.

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:26.305
Oh hey!

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.674
So what do you think
your surprise is today?

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:30.042
I have no idea.

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:31.844
This one is a very big one.

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:36.015
All right, so the offer for day 50
is $20,000 for you to see your family.

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:36.982
They're in the other room

00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:39.518
watching that feed and they can hear
everything we're saying,

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:42.021
- Hey, I miss you guys.
- Hi! I love you guys.

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:44.657
I'll be back in 10 minutes to hear
if you're going to take the offer.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.158
Good luck. 10 minutes.

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.760
This is like a pretty easy decision.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.594
What are your thoughts?

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:49.562
Oh, my gosh.
I don't know.

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:50.830
This might be the only chance

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.731
in this challenge
to see them until the end.

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:54.166
I think it's a
no brainer personally.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.201
So it's up to you on

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:56.902
if we spend 20 grand for both.

00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:58.571
Of course. I want to see my parents too.

00:13:58.571 --> 00:13:59.672
It's killing me.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.440
He is a yes and she is a no.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.576
Mom, dad, tell me what to do.

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:04.343
All right.

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:05.644
What do you think?
And where are you guys at?

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:07.179
He's been a yes from the beginning.

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.480
As soon as you said it.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.782
About 10 seconds left.

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:12.151
But it's my mom's birthday today and
we're saying yes.

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:14.019
All right.
Give me $20,000 and I'll go get them.

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.921
Best 10K ever spent,
I think.

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:16.922
Okay.

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:18.858
They paid the 20 grand.
Come on in.

00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:20.059
I'm so excited.

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:28.801
It was a tough decision.

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:30.402
I made you a birthday gift.

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:33.372
And to celebrate her birthday,
we brought a birthday cake.

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:39.578
This is the best tasty thing
they've had in forever.

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.881
It's little things like that
that you don't realize

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.149
you won't have
until you're in it.

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:45.117
Bye! Love you.

00:14:45.117 --> 00:14:46.118
Bye!

00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:48.687
That's the worst feeling so far.

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:50.089
The highest of highs.

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:54.126
And now back to our little cube
all alone.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.695
Like I said earlier,
the things we're offering

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:57.930
them are based off of what

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.165
we're overhearing them
talk about in the cube.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:02.301
So you better believe that
when Suzie said this.

00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:05.671
Probably the only thing I'd say yes to at
this point is like if they do Tesla.

00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:08.941
You already know on day 60 I knew
exactly what to surprise them with.

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.809
- How's it going?
- Hi.

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:11.310
Oh, hey.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.913
First things first.
I brought you a giant mystery gift.

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:18.017
Do the two of
you want to spend $50,000

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:19.818
to keep
what's inside of this box?

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:21.420
Is either going to be

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.489
the best moment of their life
or the worst moment.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.224
Just give me your answer in an hour.

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:26.558
All right,
Thanks. We'll be thinking.

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:28.327
59 minutes remain in.

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:29.228
I think we should.

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:31.230
I know, I think it might be worth it.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.265
Imagine it is something
great and we said no.

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:34.867
Would it ever be a car?

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:37.069
Well, it could be.
Could actually be the keys to a car.

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:39.905
It's not going to be equal
to the value that we're spending.

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.740
She's right.
It's almost three times more.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.976
I don't feel confident in the yes.

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:44.944
Then let's say no.

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:45.978
But are you sure?

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:47.246
Yeah, if you're not confident.

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:50.049
I just know
they would never do a car.

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:51.283
- Yeah, they would.
- Really?

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:53.452
Yeah I feel like they could do anything.
Let's just say no.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.220
Wait, now you have me
wanting to say yes.

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.123
Decision time.

00:15:58.123 --> 00:15:58.757
Okay.

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:02.695
Do you want to spend $50,000
to keep what is inside this box?

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:04.463
Yes or no?

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:05.197
No.

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:06.632
Really?

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:07.766
What is your answer?

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:09.034
I'm going with no.

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:09.935
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:11.971
I can't believe you guys
didn't take it.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.106
- Do you want to unlock it?
- Sure.

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:20.479
All right, inside is $50,000, so you
would have got your money back.

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:22.815
And then you want to open up
that stack of money. Just grab that.

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:27.686
Here is a Tesla key for you
and a Tesla key for you.

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:29.822
I'm so sorry.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.290
They would have gotten their money
back.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.359
Plus these two Teslas for free.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:34.860
Oh, I want to cry.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.861
Let's close this.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.264
That's literally my dream.

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:40.099
We're going to head out.

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:41.333
You leave their Beef. Thank you.

00:16:41.967 --> 00:16:43.002
 Bye.

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:45.504
- I feel defeated.
- That's wild.

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:46.705
Bailey...

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:49.408
They got us Teslas.

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:51.477
I feel like we made the wrong
decision.

00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:53.012
I'll regret this forever.

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.279
- No.
- Yeah, I will.

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:57.449
Oh, no, it's all a dream.

00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:00.019
I like my Prius.
Okay?

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.353
There, I said it.

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:06.025
And after getting hit hard
by yesterday's offer, Suzie literally

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:08.727
whined about the Tesla for nine days
straight.

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:11.063
It's really hard to see the positive
in all this.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.098
I actually won't be able to sleep.

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:16.502
I'm actually feeling sick right now.

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.871
I'm so mad.

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:20.506
Suzie's taking it hard.

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:21.473
And so to make up for it,

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:24.443
I made sure this next offer
was the best one yet.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.578
It's day 70.

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:29.248
Today's a big day
because this is the last offer.

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:31.917
So obviously on day 80,
there's only 20 days left

00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:34.286
and on day 90 you're going to be like,
why would we spend money?

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:35.721
- There's ten days left, correct?
- Yeah.

00:17:35.754 --> 00:17:37.056
- Let me just open the doors.
- Oh God

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:38.624
No shot you reject this offer.

00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:43.295
What you see here is everything
you said no to so far in this challenge.

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:45.597
Before I tell you the price tag, I'm
going to move everything in here.

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:47.599
I'm gonna make it as easy
as possible for them to say yes.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:49.835
Nolan, just put those by the TV.

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:54.206
As much as I love to
bully Nolan, he's just dumb.

00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:56.275
Here's a bed.

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:57.910
If you guys say no,
we have to move

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.044
all of this back out.

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:00.813
Well,
then give us a good price.

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:04.550
What you are considering buying
is these two $30,000 beds.

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.151
A brand new mystery box.

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:07.753
This one doesn't have 50
grand inside.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.555
It has something else.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.156
Sounds like 25 grand.

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:15.561
One phone called each, spices,
monopoly, every single movie

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:16.762
in the Walmart movie aisle.

00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:19.765
And lastly,
the cook you said no to.

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:22.568
- There is a plate of food.
- I see a lot of good food.

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:24.269
And to remind you how good it is,

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.871
here's some chicken alfredo.

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:26.939
That looks so good.

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:29.741
It's time to find out
how much this will cost you.

00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:31.610
Behind these curtains is the number.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.580
If you bid higher than that number,
you get everything here

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.514
for the rest of the challenge.

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:39.585
But if you say $1, one penny lower,
you get nothing.

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:41.353
I'll give you an hour
to figure out your bid.

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:41.887
I'm thinking,

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:45.724
what if it's like, way low
and they want us to say 150 grand?

00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:49.328
I think if we've been 75,
that would be too little.

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:51.263
They're thinking at least 100 K.

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:53.198
I actually feel like
we should go a little bit lower

00:18:53.198 --> 00:18:54.733
because we were prepared to say no
to it.

00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:55.300
That's true.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.302
But are you prepared
to walk away with nothing?

00:18:57.369 --> 00:18:58.937
And while they're deciding
what to do,

00:18:58.937 --> 00:19:00.439
I want to tell you about the Shop app.

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:03.208
The Shop app is the best way
to shop on your phone

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:04.543
and it's completely free.

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:06.578
It'll basically look at everything
you're interested in

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.347
and recommend you products you love.

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:09.481
This is the only wild card

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:11.717
because we know what beds are
and we know what movies are.

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:12.784
We don't know what's in here.

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:14.820
I have a feeling I want
whatever is inside.

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:16.688
It's actually a third contestant.

00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:18.323
Help!

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.325
And when you're ready to buy,
you can speed through

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:21.627
check out using Shop Pay.

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:25.130
Let's do this 80 grand 101,
because it's day 70.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.265
I don't want to go under 70.

00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:27.699
I feel like this gives us space.

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:29.067
I get what you're saying.

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:32.938
But imagine that was the reason why
we didn't end up getting all this.

00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:35.440
- Yeah.
- I would be so sad.

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:40.479
Shop app will even track
all your packages in one place

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.581
so you'll know exactly
when they'll arrive for the holidays.

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:45.017
A $100,000 and $100.

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.952
Yeah. It's not really
that much damage.

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:48.954
- This is it, this is the one.
- Ready? Official

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:50.956
We're flipping it.

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:52.057
I hope we get it.

00:19:52.057 --> 00:19:54.092
Let the Shop app AI assistant scan

00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:56.261
hundreds of millions of products
all over the Shop app

00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:58.830
to recommend these perfect gifts
for this holiday season.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.433
Time is up. What's the number?

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.100
Let me see it.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.903
Before you do, make sure you
download the Shop app right now.

00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:05.938
If you haven't already, I explained

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:07.606
all the benefits of it, it's
a beautiful amazing app.

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:09.041
&nbsp;Download the Shop app. Okay.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:09.741
What is your bid?

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:12.244
If it's $1 below mine,
you get nothing.

00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:14.546
$100,101.

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:16.949
Chandler reveal it.

00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:20.352
69.

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.821
We get it! Yes!

00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:24.990
- You overpaid by 30.
- I don't care.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.991
We get the bed!

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.527
This is the most excited I've been so far.

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:29.294
Oh my Gosh!

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:32.331
And this mystery box,
which I did clarify, was different.

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:35.534
It's two smaller Teslas.

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:36.969
No, I love this.

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:38.203
I'll be teaming up with the Shop app

00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:40.706
to grant thousands of wishes
this holiday season.

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:42.541
I'll tell you more about it
at the end of the video.

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:45.410
Our room feels drastically different
right now.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.146
- It's a dream.
- We now have so many things to do.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.181
It's like a vacation.

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:50.649
It's an investment for sure.

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:52.651
I think it was well worth $100,000.

00:20:52.818 --> 00:20:54.453
You may think, Oh,
the challenge is over now,

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:57.322
but one of them may lose everything
you'll see on day 99

00:20:57.322 --> 00:20:58.690
what I'm talking about.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.125
Oh my God, this is crazy.

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:02.027
Now, you would think that getting
all this stuff

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:04.997
would make both of them
a lot happier, but strangely enough,

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:07.666
the opposite actually started
to happen.

00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:12.504
One thing I took for granted on
the outside

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:16.041
was a hot shower that I also did
not share with anyone.

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:19.511
The hot water tank here
runs out so quickly and

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:21.113
Bailey always showers before me,

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.482
so I've been stuck
showering with cold water

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:25.350
for honestly a couple of months now.

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:26.985
We've been playing
the same Monopoly game

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:30.722
for like seven days
because Suzie refuses to play

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.157
like I maybe she just
hates board games.

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:36.028
I think we need to take like three days
and cram as many movies as we can.

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:37.996
All she ever does is read
or watch movies.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.865
We got to have like a movie
marathon.

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:41.700
So whenever I'm like,
Can we just finish the game?

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.534
She's like, Yeah.

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:43.802
And then it never ends up happening.

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:45.504
It's impossible to get her to focus.

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:49.708
Hey, do you want to watch
The Notebook later?

00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:51.276
No, I don't want to watch
The Notebook later.

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:54.379
We spent the last like 25 minutes
trying to choose a movie.

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:56.114
And Suzie,
what did you say you're about to go do?

00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:57.582
Shower.

00:21:57.783 --> 00:21:58.617
Sorry.

00:21:58.617 --> 00:22:00.786
She literally
does this all the time.

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:04.489
Bailey is wired right now.

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:06.224
This happens
literally every morning.

00:22:06.224 --> 00:22:09.161
He's just nonstop, so energetic
all the time.

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:11.730
I just had to come in here
because I can't go anywhere else.

00:22:11.897 --> 00:22:13.198
That's a rave right there.

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:14.900
Bailey, it's 3 a.m.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.402
Yeah,
but sometimes you got to rave.

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:20.105
Oh, get me out of here.

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:23.041
You're the worst.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.445
Do you want to play Monopoly?

00:22:28.046 --> 00:22:28.580
No.

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:30.148
Do you know where the dice are?

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:31.283
Yeah,

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:35.287
I hid them
because you keep asking me to play.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.621
So I was like,
maybe if I just hide them,

00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:38.557
then we'll never be able to play.

00:22:45.163 --> 00:22:46.965
Your toes look so long.

00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:48.800
No, that's sickening.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.769
My dogs are barking.

00:22:52.471 --> 00:22:54.039
I would like to be saved.

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.676
Mom, I'm ready to leave.

00:22:57.676 --> 00:23:00.178
Even though at this point
they could hardly stand each other.

00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:02.881
With the end so close,
they set their differences aside

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:04.149
and counted down the days.

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:05.417
Four days left, three.

00:23:05.617 --> 00:23:06.551
And Bailey, well...

00:23:06.752 --> 00:23:07.786
 It's going to be

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:11.823
Really couldn't wait
to walk out those doors.

00:23:13.325 --> 00:23:15.293
I wasn't in the middle
of saying anything.

00:23:15.293 --> 00:23:16.161
All right.

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:18.163
Day 99.

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:20.899
For me, it feels like it's been
honestly an entire year.

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:22.367
I can't imagine
what they're feeling.

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:24.169
I have to brush my teeth
one more time.

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:25.170
Ever

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:28.039
24 hours remain.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.808
- This many.
- Yes.

00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:33.779
So this is the first second of
the challenge when you've both walked in.

00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:36.314
- Oh, my Gosh.
- How was that us?

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:39.684
I feel like I look
like I'm a fetus in that.

00:23:39.885 --> 00:23:40.986
Come on in, gentleman.

00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:42.721
Set it up right above the door.

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:44.022
It's so exciting.

00:23:44.022 --> 00:23:47.292
You officially have 24 hours
left in the challenge.

00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:48.960
Don't forget what I said.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.296
We got a fun twist for tomorrow.

00:23:51.296 --> 00:23:51.930
I'm scared.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.398
You think they'll still be friends
after this?

00:23:53.398 --> 00:23:55.367
Depends
what their answer is tomorrow.

00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:58.103
I'm worried that it's
going to be double or nothing.

00:23:58.203 --> 00:23:59.271
He's so, like, quiet about it.

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.372
- You can't guess.
- Yeah.

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:02.274
And with their final night
coming to an end,

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:05.644
It was time to present them with an
opportunity to double their money.

00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:07.813
Hey, everyone.

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:09.648
This is chaotic.

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:10.916
What is going on?

00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:11.883
I don't know.

00:24:12.517 --> 00:24:13.452
Big boy.

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:14.719
I want to help, but not really.

00:24:14.719 --> 00:24:16.888
They're literally just taking everything.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.291
Do you know what these are?

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.892
Those are blindfolds
from the first day.

00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:21.526
That was quick.

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:22.727
I remember it like it was yesterday.

00:24:22.727 --> 00:24:24.729
If you would both
please put them back on.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.865
Let's see
if they want to double their money.

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:27.632
Okay.

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:31.670
Oh my gosh, my heart is actually
beating out of my chest.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.672
100 days ago, they were strangers.

00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:35.340
One hour ago they were best friends.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.142
Let's
see if they become total enemies.

00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:38.009
Bailey and Suzie,

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:39.611
take your blindfolds off.

00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:44.282
So you might be familiar
with what we're about to offer you.

00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:48.887
You each have the choice to split
the money, and nothing changes.

00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:50.489
You both hit split.
You just split it.

00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:51.656
Keep what you have,

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:55.260
or if you hit steal, you can steal
the other person's money.

00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:57.562
And if you both hit
steal, you would get nothing.

00:24:58.797 --> 00:25:00.532
Suzie has earplugs in

00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:02.767
and noise cancellation
headphones on top of them.

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:05.003
She can't hear us.
What's going through your head?

00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:10.775
I don't even know, Suzie
if you put steal, I can't imagine.

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:13.411
What do you say to somebody
that steals 180? Whatever.

00:25:13.411 --> 00:25:15.647
Maybe you get ahead of it
and you steal it.

00:25:15.647 --> 00:25:16.281
Fair.

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:17.449
Do you hear that?

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:19.217
Bailey actually might.
Bailey might.

00:25:19.217 --> 00:25:21.953
All right.
throw the music back in his ears.

00:25:21.953 --> 00:25:23.522
What if while we were over there,
he was like,

00:25:23.555 --> 00:25:25.223
"Oh, this is a no brainer.
It's too much money"

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:26.291
We would never speak again.

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:28.226
You guys have become, like,
such close friends.

00:25:28.226 --> 00:25:29.761
I don't know.
You get to know anyone.

00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:32.397
And when you've gone
through the same thing

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:36.535
and like how hard this challenge has
been, we both deserve half for sure.

00:25:36.568 --> 00:25:38.637
But now you're making me nervous.

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:40.505
Like I could do it, too.

00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:42.240
What did she just say?

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.476
Maybe it'll be a case of you
thinking of someone.

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:45.176
I don't know.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.678
If both of them press the steal button,

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:48.914
they literally spend 100 days
in this room together

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.148
for absolutely nothing.

00:25:50.148 --> 00:25:53.552
There's 30 seconds left in the
challenge at the very last second.

00:25:53.685 --> 00:25:55.754
I want you both to place your vote.

00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:59.157
Do you want to walk away
with 360 grand or half of it?

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:00.058
No one speak.

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:01.893
Karl and Kris,
you two don't talk either.

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:05.163
I know that Suzie is going to split,
but the thought of walking away

00:26:05.163 --> 00:26:09.601
with almost $360,000,
I could do so much.

00:26:09.634 --> 00:26:11.570
Do you want to split the money
or steal it?

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.238
The fact that I entered this
challenge,

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:13.939
Three.

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:15.240
Knowing that

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.375
there would be pretty dark
times ahead

00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:18.143
Two.

00:26:18.143 --> 00:26:20.378
And I still overcame all those things

00:26:20.378 --> 00:26:21.146
One.

00:26:21.146 --> 00:26:22.814
There's no price you can put on that.

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:25.917
No way.

00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:28.386
If the room turns red,
then someone stole.

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:31.690
If the room turns green,
then you split the money.

00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:34.159
You both chose split!

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:35.226
Yes!

00:26:35.894 --> 00:26:36.828
Yes!

00:26:37.028 --> 00:26:38.863
Congratulations on surviving!

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:39.598
- Yeah!
- Yes!

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:43.068
There you go, there's your money!
Follow me out here.

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:47.372
And like I said
earlier in the video, don't

00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:48.640
forget to download the Shop app.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.275
If you go on my store
in the Shop app,

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.977
you can tell me whatever you want
for the holiday.

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:53.912
And I'm going to be fulfilling
thousands of wishes.

00:26:53.912 --> 00:26:56.615
You can say
like a Tesla, Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

00:26:56.648 --> 00:26:59.184
Feastables bars, doesn't matter.
Thank you Shop app.

00:26:59.217 --> 00:27:00.352
I appreciate you so much.

00:27:00.352 --> 00:27:01.419
And as always,

00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:02.621
 let’s blow this place up.
