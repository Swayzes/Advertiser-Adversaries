00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:00.940
(upbeat music)

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.450
- All right, so you've seen the unboxing.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.040
Now it's time for the breakdown.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.903
What is using the Apple
Vision Pro actually like?

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.210
This is easily one of Apple's
craziest, most radical,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.970
possibly dystopian products of all time.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.370
And I have a lot of thoughts here,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.440
like I've been using it
for about a week now.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.700
There are some parts of this thing

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.500
that are absolutely incredible,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.870
and some other parts that feel weird,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.060
or borderline unfinished.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.920
There are all kinds of new technologies,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.460
from a new operating system
to infrared eye tracking

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.610
to virtually reconstructed
versions of you.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.120
I feel like there are so
many actually new things

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.190
that you have to understand
in order to get a sense

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.800
of what this headset
actually is and what it does.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.380
So I'm gonna break this
down into two parts.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.010
This video is all about
using the Vision Pro.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.720
It's everything I've
learned from the past week

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.260
of wearing and getting used to
this thing every single day.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.530
But I'm also working
on a more wide ranging,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.230
possibly more existential, review video.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.300
But let's just start with the more

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.490
hardware fundamentals, right?

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.790
Like what is this thing
that I'm holding literally?

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.280
Apple Vision Pro at its core,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.230
well, it is a VR headset.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.610
Now, Apple would never say that,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.040
and they probably won't like
that I'm saying that word.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.360
You know, I made an entire video

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.520
about why they refuse to use those words,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.850
and they're calling it
spatial computing instead.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.683
We'll get there.

00:01:30.683 --> 00:01:33.300
But the truth is it's a
really, really, really high end

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.550
virtual reality headset.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.410
It's something we've seen before, right?

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.530
It's got displays and lenses and speakers

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.420
and fans and buttons.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.010
And this is a form factor.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.230
This is a thing that we have seen before,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.120
but before I even turn this thing on,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.860
there are clearly several things

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.960
that are a little
different about this one.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.940
So first of all, it's made of metal.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.420
Lots of metal and glass
here, which are high quality,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.570
but heavy materials, relatively speaking.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.510
So there's this precisely
machined aluminum frame

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.470
around the outside.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.260
And yes, those are intakes
for fans at the bottom.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.660
And then vents for those fans at the top.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.340
On the right side,
there's your digital crown

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.140
that can be pressed in or turned.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.320
And then on the other side is
just a single larger button.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.780
So kind of basically the same
two buttons as an Apple Watch.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.040
And then when you get
a little further back

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.260
on this band here, these little pods

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.230
with downward facing
grills, these are speakers

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.240
which are pointed straight at your ears,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.830
and work surprisingly well.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.010
Though of course, it also
means that people around you

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.170
can hear a little bit
of what you're hearing.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.430
There's a little bit of bleed,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.650
and I have a lot to say
about spatial audio,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.120
so stay tuned for that.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.430
But the main event is at the front.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.667
There is an enormous piece of glass,

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.160
which, yes, is very easy
to fingerprint and smudge.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.140
And then behind that thing,
there's this outward-facing

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.350
OLED display and a bunch of
sensors all the way around,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.780
outside facing sensors that go forward,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.150
sideways, and straight down.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.580
And there's depth sensors,
infrared illuminators,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.180
lidar scanners, and just
regular old RGB cameras,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.580
all being processed by an M2 chip

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.740
and an R1 chip inside this thing.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.270
And then maybe the craziest part,

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.450
inside the headset, there
are a bunch more sensors

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.990
facing your eyes, tracking
your eyes in real time,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.360
for all the eye control and
everything that comes with that.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.350
And also then to display a
representation of your eyes

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.870
on the outside of the headset.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.640
Kinda, we'll get there.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.530
But overall, when you put it all together,

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.190
you get a very well made, very high end,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.150
but also pretty heavy
computer to wear on your face.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.510
So officially, this headset
with this solo knit band

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.410
when I weighed it, showed up as 638 grams,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.480
which some of you on Twitter
have already pointed out

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.500
is actually slightly less than
the plastic Meta Quest Pro.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.380
But that Quest Pro also
has a lot of battery

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.680
on the back of your head as
a sort of a counterbalance,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.770
so the weight distribution
is very different.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.080
Also, the Quest Pro is not
that comfortable anyway.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.680
But the point is this,
for Apple, made the choice

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.000
of taking the battery off of
the headset, which means okay,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.380
now there's nothing on
the back of your head,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.540
so you can wear it and
lean up against things,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.220
and that might be an upside,

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.110
but that also now means you have to deal

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.290
with this cable all the time
running up to your head,

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.380
and the fact that it's
very front weighted now.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.360
All of the weight is on
the front of your face.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.970
So this is the battery, as
you saw in the unboxing.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.400
If you haven't already seen the
unboxing, that just went up.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.420
I'll link it below the like button.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.940
But this battery is a surprisingly small

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.550
3,366 milliamp hours.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.580
I say surprisingly small
because a normal battery bank

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.627
of this size, you might
expect to be 10, 15,

00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:43.110
20,000 milliamp hours.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.680
I suspect there's a lot of
heat insulation happening here.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.740
But it comes with a
non-removable four foot cable,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.320
and a proprietary connector
at the end of the cable

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.270
that will twist and lock to the headset.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.680
And so the lock is really solid.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.390
It makes sense that it's
not just straight USB

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.980
that could get disconnected easily.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.290
Once you connect it, it starts glowing,

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.550
and then it starts booting up.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.830
And there's even a little
Apple logo that displays

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.590
on the outside screen
while it takes, you know,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.030
a little under a minute to turn on.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.860
So there is no on or off button

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.570
or switch anywhere on this headset.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.670
Maybe kind of like AirPods
Max or something like that.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.830
So if you ever take the headset off

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.380
and put it down, it will
enter a standby mode

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.630
after some time, but it won't turn off.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.840
If you wanna turn it off,
you literally have to twist

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.250
and unplug the cable.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.980
That's the only way to
actually turn the headset off.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.530
Now famously already, the battery life

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.170
with this included
battery, is not super long

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.460
on this headset.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.590
Two to four hours is actually realistic

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.130
for what you can expect for
just like this built-in battery.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.540
But that's also kind of right in line

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.800
with a lot of other VR headsets.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.320
Battery life on VR headsets
is not that great in general.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.602
If you do wanna use it longer,
the only way to do that

00:05:48.602 --> 00:05:51.510
is there's USBC port on the battery,

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.430
and you have to plug the battery in.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.170
So you could plug the
battery into the wall

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.850
for infinite battery life,

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.560
or I guess you could plug it into like a,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.530
you could daisy chain another
battery into the other pocket

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.880
or something for even longer life.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.680
But yeah, two to four hours.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.910
Now at first it seemed weird to me

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.130
that the port is on the
same side of the battery

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.420
as the non-removable cable,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.730
but I think it's because
they just want you to default

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.070
to putting this battery in your pocket,

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.330
probably in your back pocket.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.520
So even if it's plugged into the wall,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.100
it can still be in your back pocket.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.200
You're just gonna want to
get a longer USBC cable.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.550
So there are no controllers
that come with this headset.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.170
Now it does support other input methods

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.140
that are like game controllers,
and mouse, and keyboard,

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.880
and those can be incredibly useful,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.670
but by default the primary input method

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.650
for everyone using the Vision Pro

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.230
is your eyes and your hands.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.420
So the first time you put on this headset,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.090
it goes through this calibration process,

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.590
and it's pretty interesting.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.180
So the first time you ever put it on,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.120
it first adjusts the
distance between the lenses,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.040
physically moving them inside the headset

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.020
to match the distance between your eyes.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.820
Then it does this sort of a hand scan

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.960
so it understands your hands.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.070
And then you go through this process

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.230
of basically looking at a bunch of dots

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.550
all the way around the screen,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.190
and then tapping your fingers
together to select them.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.740
Kind of feels like an
eye test or something.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.573
And then you're in.

00:07:08.573 --> 00:07:09.510
So first thing you're gonna notice

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.880
is you can actually kind
of put your hands anywhere

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.030
as long as the headset can see this,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.890
just your fingers touching together.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.710
So there's a lot of pictures
of people using a headset

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.090
with their fingers, like
out in front of them,

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.170
pinching like that.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.610
But you actually don't have to do that.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.160
It's such a wide angle
because of the sensors

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.590
facing forward and sideways and down.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.050
You can kind of just
rest your hand anywhere,

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.670
in front of you, in your lap.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.930
As long as you pinch like that,

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.300
it can generally pick it
up, which is impressive.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.770
So you're pinching to control anywhere

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.630
in that 180 degree bubble in front of you.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.600
And then the digital
crown, you hit that once,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.300
and the app drawer
comes up, pretty simple.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.530
Doesn't seem that impressive.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.260
But this is actually a peek
at the first really impressive

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.530
thing about this headset to
me, which is it seems to have

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.010
incredible spatial positioning lock,

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:00.750
and like, it's really hard
to have you appreciate this

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.920
through a YouTube video.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.510
Reviewing VR headsets is hard.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.160
But turn around in the room you're in,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.760
and picture a wall or a window

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.760
just appearing locked in place
in 3D space in your room,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.510
and no matter how much you move your head,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.000
or move around, it stays
exactly kind of floating

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.840
where it's supposed to be.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.360
But when I say floating, I
think you're picturing like a,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.320
a soft float, but it's locked,
and that's how it starts.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.220
So now you're in Apple's new Vision OS

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.630
I would describe this as
kind of similar to iPad OS,

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.360
but way more glassy, and of course

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.970
with the extra dimension of 3D space.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.400
So hitting a digital crown
will always get the app drawer

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.030
back in front of you, and
then simply look at the icon

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.620
you want and pinch your fingers together,

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.660
to select it and open that app.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.940
Scrolling is basically as you'd expect,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.130
you just kind of pinch
and grab in the air,

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.410
and then pull as if it's on a string,

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.810
and physics let you pull
things through the air.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.470
It's pretty intuitive, it's
responsive, it's fluid.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.240
Sometimes it's kind of bouncy even.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.340
I would say the biggest adjustment

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.590
is only being able to control

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.690
exactly what you're looking at.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.890
And I don't think people realize

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.420
how often they're controlling things

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.910
that they're not exactly
looking directly at

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.770
with other computers and other UIs.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.400
But with this, you can look
at the button to select it,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.110
and if you look at the
next thing you're gonna do,

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.610
you're no longer controlling the button.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.470
You have to look exactly
where you're trying

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.640
to interact with things.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.170
It takes a few extra brain cycles

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.450
to remember to always be looking

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.100
exactly at the thing you're controlling.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.980
So when you open a window
of a Vision OS app,

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.290
like any one of the
default Apple apps here,

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.600
it locks into place, it's floating there.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.700
It kind of looks, again, like an iPad app,

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.700
but very glassy, like this
frosted glass around the UI

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.110
sort of lets you see through a little bit

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.160
to the color behind it.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.670
And it even sometimes casts
a shadow on the ground

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.580
in the correct Z space,
so it really solidifies

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.350
that it's floating in front of you.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.360
All this makes it feel like the window

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.070
is in the space around you.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.020
Then if you look at the
bottom of the window,

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.900
you get a little bar, you can
always just look at that bar

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.030
and pinch to drag it around.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.210
So drag it forward,
backward, anywhere you want

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.850
in X, Y, and Z space, and then let go

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.500
and it just stays absolutely locked.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.350
And then you can look at
either bottom corner to resize

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.000
to make it bigger or smaller.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.430
And then finally there's
a little X at the bottom,

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.170
you select that, that closes it.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.470
So that is the basics of Vision OS,

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.850
and just using an app.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.430
Now this entire time, by default,

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.700
and almost any time they
can, passthrough is on,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.140
which means you have the headset on,

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.970
but you can see with the cameras

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.320
right through to everything around you.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.850
And I think this is
where Apple really wants

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.150
to normalize the term spatial computing,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.910
because it feels like augmented reality.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.580
It feels like you're always
able to see the space

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.190
around you, but technically
it's not actually AR,

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.400
because you are still looking
at a reconstructed version

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.200
through a camera feed
of the world around you

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.630
instead of the actual world around you.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.700
But maybe it's all just semantics.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.660
I will say, this is the best
passthrough of any VR headset

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.730
I've ever used, and it's
not even that close.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.450
Now again, it's so hard to get
this through a YouTube video.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.160
It does have screen recording built in,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.330
so I'm gonna try to use that.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.730
But imagine putting a headset on,

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.880
and not really feeling like
you're looking at a screen

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.380
with the real world.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.670
Because of the pixel density,

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.620
because of the 90 hertz refresh rate,

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.170
and because of the impressive
dynamic range of the cameras

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.390
and the correctly adjusting shutter speed,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.040
you just almost don't,

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.140
you almost just feel like you're looking

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.850
at the real world, not through a headset.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.150
Also the passthrough is
so close to real time

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.270
that I could legitimately
interact with all kinds of things.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.670
I could catch items flying at me.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.620
I even tried playing ping pong.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.420
It was easy, no hesitation.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.360
So officially, the R1 chip
is doing all the processing

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.340
of all this stuff and
adjusting the shutter speed

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.480
for different lighting conditions

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.670
and always keeping passthrough latency

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.540
under 12 milliseconds, which
is the lowest in the industry.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.410
But it's really combining
that with how close to reality

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.780
the colors and brightness
and everything are

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.150
that keeps it feeling kind of real.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.340
Basically, the only noticeable restriction

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.000
is super close up items and
objects can get a bit blurry,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.610
and then you can't quite
make out really small

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.130
or fine texts, so you can't read an email

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.200
or a tiny text on your phone in your hand,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.270
but you can absolutely text people,

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.730
or read your notifications,
while keeping the headset on.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.050
If you've tried other VR headsets,

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.310
you know how impressive that is.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.460
It's just, it's really good with the tech

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.683
that exists now for VR headsets.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.010
But you can definitely
still take the headset off

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.990
and be like, oh, it's way brighter in here

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.580
than I thought it was.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.800
Either way, that's all passthrough,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.260
but if you ever wanna
fully immerse yourself,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.630
I mean it is a VR headset after all,

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.440
all you gotta do is rotate
this digital crown clockwise,

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.360
just keep turning it, and it will slowly

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.380
dial your environment more and
more into your field of view

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.990
until you dial it all the way
up to fully surrounding you.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.210
So all of the windows
you might have had open

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.740
will still stay stuck where they were,

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.150
but everything you're doing
is just on the moon now.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.740
So yeah, there's a couple environments

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.150
Apple has built in here,

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.240
most of them relaxing scenic locations,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.220
like in California somewhere,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.230
or one really nice one is Mount Hood

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.760
with a little bit of rain falling.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.610
They're not quite photorealistic,

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.710
but they're just short of photorealistic,

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.010
like they're the most
realistic digital environments

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:26.843
that I've seen.

00:13:26.843 --> 00:13:31.843
So then the last two big quirks
of the UI, control center.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.780
So the only way to get to control center

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.180
is to look up, and you can't just look up,

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.040
but you have to physically
turn your head up

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.660
and look at this arrow
that appears above you.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.250
So once you see that, you select that

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.380
and then you get your control
center for things like,

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.380
you know, battery life and
notifications, focus modes,

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.200
and screen recording,
and pairing to a Mac.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.470
But the other big quirk is text input.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.350
So you might be wondering
how does text input work

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.170
with no physical controllers?

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.240
So there's basically
three ways to do this.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.400
So let's say you are in Safari,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.407
and you want to go to mkbhd.com.

00:14:04.407 --> 00:14:07.320
You really want one of those
shiny new Chevron hoodies

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.430
for the rest of winter.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.660
Great, how do you do it?

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.780
So the first way is to
literally hunt and peck

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.610
poking the keys on the keyboard

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.070
that appears in the air in front of you.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.550
So this one is tough, because
it literally only reacts

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.650
to your pointer finger on each hand.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.060
So you actually can't type fast,

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.100
like with home row or anything like that.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:26.933
Not great.

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:29.190
The second way, though, I
think is actually kind of good.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.280
It's at least faster,
which is looking at the key

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.370
you want to interact with, and
then pinching to select it.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.160
So just looking around
the keyboard like this,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.060
and selecting the keys.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.220
And you might be surprised how
fast you can type like this

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.920
if you actually know your way
around a keyboard pretty well.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.070
I actually prefer this to
poking the virtual keys

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.380
because I at least get a
little bit of haptic feedback

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.510
from my own fingers tapping together.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.100
But then in Safari, the last way to do it

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.990
is literally to just
look up at the microphone

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.910
and say the URL out loud.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.470
MKBHD.com.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:59.460
And then it just hears you

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.500
and goes to the site pretty quick,

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.800
if it's a URL that you
can actually say out loud.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.450
So, what can you actually
do with this thing?

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.780
Like now that we know what
it is, it's the M2 chip,

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.600
a computer on your face with the displays

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.030
and the lenses inside, and all
sorts of sensors everywhere.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.710
What can this thing actually do?

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.720
And I feel like the most
common way to phrase that

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.640
is what is the killer app?

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.560
Because that's, we feel
like we need some sort

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.940
of justification to spend
three, $4,000 on this thing.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.600
Like applications made the
iPhone what it is as we know it,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.460
like apps made the iPad.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.733
So what is the app
situation on the Vision Pro?

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.080
So there are two types of apps
on the Vision Pro, actually.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.440
The first is apps that
are built specifically

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.600
for the Vision Pro to take advantage

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.580
of its awesome experiences.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.920
And there are a few of those right now,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.140
and then there are all the other apps,

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.750
which basically are iPhone and iPad apps

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.910
that happen to be compatible

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.673
because the developer didn't opt out.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.790
And the first kind is way cooler.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.250
So these are Apple's stock apps here

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.780
that come with the Vision Pro.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.620
And so these are all, of course,
made just for Vision Pro.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.320
So they're gonna have stuff
that takes full advantage

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.760
of what this thing is capable of.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.260
Apple Music is a pretty classic one,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.910
like it has all the same functionality

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.230
of any other Apple Music app,

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.260
but in this super glassy frosted window,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.720
and shows the colors of
whatever's behind it.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.500
And you have the sort of sorting
menu on the left hand side

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.700
instead of across the bottom.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.080
That's the basic layout.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.180
Same thing with the Notes
app and the Settings app.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.210
Very glassy, almost looking
like an iPad app in the air,

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:42.120
just rebuilt with this
new material design.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.070
And then there's the media apps.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:48.090
So Apple TV and Disney+,
they both come pre-installed,

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.760
which they have built entire environments

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.800
inside of them for watching media.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.500
And there's even a small
collection of videos

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.270
on the Apple TV app that are shot

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.740
on a new proprietary format

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.300
specifically for Vision Pro.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.830
So it drops you into a space
with a full 180 degree video,

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.110
and Alicia Keys walks right up to you

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.060
and starts singing right to your face.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:09.893
It's crazy.

00:17:09.893 --> 00:17:10.726
There's also the Photos app,

00:17:10.726 --> 00:17:13.230
which will let you look
at panoramic photos,

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.840
for example, in this fully immersive view.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.000
So you can blow them up to full screen,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.950
and then it gives you a
bit of a parallax effect

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.260
around the edges, so it
feels like you're looking

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.620
into a window of your own
photo and looking around.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:26.520
It's kind of incredible.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.140
And then there's also
some other really fun

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.580
third party apps that I've tried

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.570
that were built ahead of time.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.280
So Sky Guide, this is a good one.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.220
You can look around a real
representation of the sky

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.390
around you or any of the
constellations would normally be,

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.090
you can look at it a little
longer and it'll pop it out.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.920
You can pull it outta the sky

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.660
to get more information about it.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.130
It's a pretty great idea.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.050
There's another one called Jig Space,

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.640
which is, it's a sick app,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.840
I don't know if I'd ever use it,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.330
but basically it lets you load 3D models

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.000
into the space you're in
and mess around with them,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.730
take 'em apart, view them in actual size.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.770
And this really takes
advantage of how good

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.540
the placement lock is on the Vision Pro.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.610
And you can walk around,
and really gets you

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.920
a better understanding
of the scale of things

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.410
that you don't get to
see up close very often.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.420
And then Keynote is another funny one.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.780
So you can of course go
through and edit a Keynote

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.340
just like normal if you want to,

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.280
but then they've built
this whole environment

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.620
for practicing your presentation skills.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.510
So you press that and it
says, oh, would you like to go

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.930
to a conference room, or the
literal Steve Jobs Theater,

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.720
so you can rehearse
talking to your audience

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.850
with your Keynote slides behind you.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.580
It is genuinely incredibly immersive.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.200
And there's already a
bunch more apps like this

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.550
in the App Store already at launch

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.520
that are specifically
built for Vision Pro.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.430
So they'll take advantage
of its various strengths.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.883
Now, are any of these a killer app?

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:49.763
Not really.

00:18:49.763 --> 00:18:52.410
I mean I don't, if you're
looking for any one of these

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.080
to be the reason why you spend
like $4,000 on this headset,

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.390
I don't think we have that yet.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.570
But then at least there's
all the other non-native,

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.390
but technically still compatible, apps

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.740
that are in the App Store.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.380
And these are gonna look just
like iPhone and iPad apps.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.260
Actually, there's a pre-installed
folder on the home screen

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.950
when you get this thing
literally called Compatible Apps,

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.230
and there's a bunch of
them from Apple here.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.970
They look exactly like iPad apps.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.490
I'm surprised actually
that more of them aren't

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.010
fully built out to take
advantage of Vision Pro,

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.400
but like, Apple Maps is just the iPad app.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.400
And so it would be cool
if there were some fun

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.190
augmented reality overlay
walking directions type stuff,

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.250
but nope, it's all the
exact same functionality

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.350
that you would find if you
opened this app on your iPad.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.550
And you can go to the App Store

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.140
and search a bunch of the names of apps

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.750
you already know and love,
and find them by name

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.880
and grab them, and they'll
work the exact same way.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.310
Crazily enough though, there are already

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.370
some notable exceptions.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:54.120
No Netflix app for the
Vision Pro, no YouTube app

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.960
for the Vision Pro, no Spotify
app for the Vision Pro.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.440
Apple has kind of a
contentious relationship

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.730
with a lot of developers right now,

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.890
especially some of the bigger ones.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.730
And so some have made the
active choice to opt out.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.770
They're like, we don't wanna be there.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.620
This won't be a big enough
platform to matter to us

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.670
to justify the work.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:15.503
So they're not there.

00:20:15.503 --> 00:20:16.410
Now I totally get it,

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.420
but also now as a Vision Pro owner

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.920
and someone who's using it,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.140
I'm like, oh, it's kind of a bummer.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.520
I really wanted to be able to
watch a Netflix show offline,

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.610
downloaded it ahead of time,
but you can't do that now.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.010
But at least, at least
for now, for the record,

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.540
you can use the browser,

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.340
and anything that would
work in the browser.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.420
So if you pull up Safari,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.330
and you get a full screen
4K YouTube video going,

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.510
and locked in space, or
even in an environment,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.343
it looks great.

00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:44.400
It's razor sharp.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.010
Like, I could totally watch
YouTube videos like this.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.740
But you will definitely
be missing the features

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.410
of having the dedicated
app, like offline video.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:56.760
Honestly to me, the killer
app of the Vision Pro

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.990
isn't just an app, it's
actually the ecosystem.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.220
And we knew this was coming,

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.880
but the second you log into a
Vision Pro with your Apple ID,

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.400
immediately it starts
pulling all the services,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.780
and all the stuff that you're used to

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.360
from all the other Apple
devices you already have.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.010
And I said this before the
Vision Pro was announced,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.020
I was like, this is the most
obvious strategy for Apple

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.030
because there are lots of people out there

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.520
who have never considered
buying a VR headset

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.770
that are considering only this one

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.150
because they have an iPhone,

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.760
and this is the one that
works with the iPhone,

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.440
and none of the others
are particularly close.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.420
So all of your iMessages are already here,

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.190
all of your photos are already here

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.930
and loaded up and backed up.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.210
All your Notes are already
at your fingertips.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.710
You already saw the Keynote app.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.620
But okay, easily my favorite feature

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.570
is connecting to your Mac, right?

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.310
So anytime your Mac is in front of you

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.110
and it's turned on, hit that arrow

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.310
and then there's this little icon

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.250
to Become My Mac's Virtual Display.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.440
So I click that, and then pick my Mac,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.720
and it pretty much instantly,
it actually blacks out

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.260
the display of my Mac, and
then turns that display

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.130
into a 4K window inside of the headset.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.220
So now my keyboard and
trackpad still work,

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.420
even if it is a desktop.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.550
The keyboard and the trackpad
still control everything,

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.310
and you can continue using it
just like a normal computer,

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.280
but with the ability to
make your new 4K monitor

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.630
as big or as small or close
or far away as you want,

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.800
which is super sick.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.710
And then the bonus is
you can still open up

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:27.360
and place other Vision Pro
apps around your Mac computer.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.190
So like you can have your
Mac in the middle here,

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.250
and maybe you're editing or
doing some work on the Mac app,

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.490
and then you have a Safari
window, or Messages,

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.490
or whatever else you want
right next to it around it.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.370
And then your keyboard
and trackpad can move

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:45.600
seamlessly between them
all to control all of them.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.800
This, to me, as a Mac user,
the ease of use for setup

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.360
to make this happen, this feels like

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.470
the biggest game changer,

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.650
like the most compelling
futuristic feeling

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.330
use of this headset to me.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.920
Especially on a plane.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.450
Oh my god, I can't tell you how many times

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.130
I've had an awkward conversation because,

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.630
like, I'm editing a video on the plane,

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.000
the person next to me sees
I'm editing a video of myself,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.280
and it's kind of weird
and hard to explain,

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.040
but I'm picturing putting the headset on,

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.510
the display blacks out,

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.370
but now I can do all the editing I want,

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.110
and I can make the
screen as big as I want.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.790
So I've really enjoyed using that feature.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.590
Again, the biggest challenge, though,

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:23.190
is still remembering to
look exactly at the thing

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.600
you want to control.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.810
So aside from typing on the real keyboard

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.940
on whatever window is open, if you want

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.630
to control something, you
have to be looking at it.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:34.830
Again, it doesn't sound like a big deal,

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.050
but when you try it,
you'll see what I mean.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.830
And then also, odd
limitation, one monitor only.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.010
From the Mac, one virtual
monitor only at a time.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.560
So if you usually run a
dual display setup like I do

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.080
for Final Cut Pro, big
preview on one side,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.270
timeline on the other
side, you can't do that.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:55.140
You have to use the big one
monitor version of your setup.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.850
All right, so you might have realized

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:00.030
I've left one thing out this whole time.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.940
One thing, you could call
it one more thing, sure.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.030
It's one more huge crazy thing,

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:09.240
but it's kind of the defining
characteristic of this product

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.910
and that is Personas.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:15.870
So in all the advertising
you've seen of Vision Pro,

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.200
there's these eyes on the
outside of the headset

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.960
that looks like they're
kind of in a passthrough,

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.960
like in a dark astronaut
helmet type of thing.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.420
Easily the most memed, most unique aspect

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.590
of this headset, right?

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.050
It's the only headset
with an outward display.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.380
And I mean it's very, very
prominent in those videos,

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.990
but in real life, as you've started to see

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.770
from some of my footage,
it is very different,

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.510
and I think I figured out why.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.270
So first of all, it's not
actually see-through, right?

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.680
There's a whole bunch of computer

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.270
in between me and you right now.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.610
So the eyes aren't on the outside.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.160
It's a representation of my eyes

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.680
based on what all the sensors
on the inside are seeing.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.150
It's reconstructing it on the outside.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.660
So those sensors are tracking
at 90 frames per second,

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.300
and they give you optic ID, which is,

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.370
it's how you log into the
headset and keep things secure.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.880
It's basically the same
as face ID, or touch ID,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.130
it's just looking at and
identifying your eyes.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:15.930
And it also powers the one
beta feature of this headset,

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:20.670
which is Personas, which
is, it's the most impressive

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.640
and weirdest thing about this
headset at the same time.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.540
I'm calling it right now.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.700
So the purpose of the eyes on the outside

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.610
is really not for you,
the wearer of the headset.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:30.870
In fact, you'll never see it.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.400
But it's for the people around you.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.710
So when you're in a passthrough mode,

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.870
your eyes will shine through

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.390
to indicate that you wearing the headset

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.430
can see the person outside.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.860
So that right there is
already pretty unique.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.840
But then, when you're
in something immersive

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.480
and you can't see what's around
you, it covers up your eyes

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.020
with this sort of like a blue,
purple glowing animation.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.400
So that intuitively makes sense.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.720
You can see the eyes
when they can see you,

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.190
you can't see the eyes
when they can't see you.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.900
But crazily enough, there's also a feature

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.930
where if you have someone
who's outside the headset

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.280
looking at you, talking to you,

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.110
and you are in an immersion,

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:08.220
but you want to talk to them through that,

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.340
they will kind of appear through the fog

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.830
of whatever immersive
environment you're in.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.260
So you just start talking and
looking in their direction.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.070
It detects that, and sort of
parts a little bit of a fog

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.070
and that person's eyes
will show through the fog.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.090
It's pretty decent.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.760
It basically only shows
one person at a time.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.850
And when this is happening on
the outside of the headset,

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.370
it shows a little bit of
your eyes poking through

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.160
the purple and blue glow.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.160
It's, as you can see, it's all working,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.760
but also, I think it looks
nothing like the eyes

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.593
from the ad.

00:26:42.593 --> 00:26:44.730
So in an effort to make the eyes

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.430
as presentable as possible, two things.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.040
First of all, this
screen is actually behind

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.640
a lenticular film, which
I didn't even realize that

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.380
from the initial media they had published.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.700
But if you've ever heard of that,

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.340
it's sort of what gives it this 3D depth.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.860
You might have seen this on
other holographic displays

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.270
and stuff, but the point of that

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:07.350
is to make the eyes appear to
be sunken into the display,

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.180
like on your actual face,

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.060
instead of glued to the
front of the headset,

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.320
which would look a little more weird.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.680
But then two, to represent
your actual eyes,

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.650
they've built in a way to scan in

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.890
and create a digital
representation of your face,

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.110
which is called your Persona.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:26.160
And it looks like this.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.280
So to get those eyes on the outside

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.380
of the Vision Pro headset,
you have to do something

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.780
called registering your Persona.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.600
This is how it creates
the digital version of you

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.110
that includes your eyes
that will show up here.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.090
So let's do that now.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.620
It's actually kind of a cool process.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.780
So I'm gonna put it on, and
hopefully the screen recording

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.700
works so you can see
exactly what I'm doing.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.840
I'll hit the digital crown.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.310
I'm gonna go to Settings.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.960
And you can do this when
you first set it up.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.960
But I'm going to Persona, and
I'm gonna hit Get Started.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.900
So let's refine my hands real quick.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.630
This is capturing detail
from the front of the headset

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:05.193
of the hands in front of me.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:08.583
Once it's done with that-

00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:10.410
- [Automated Voice] Your
Persona, remove Apple Vision Pro.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:12.300
- It's gonna ask me to take it off.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.923
So this is how it goes.

00:28:13.923 --> 00:28:15.060
- [Automated Voice] When you're ready,

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.013
hold Apple Vision Pro at eye level.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:20.283
Keep your arms and shoulders relaxed.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.700
Align your entire face within the frame.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.650
- [Marques] My face shows up like face ID.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.133
- [Automated Voice] Slowly
turn your head to the right.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.373
Now slowly turn your head to the left.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:37.683
Now tilt your head up,

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.143
then tilt your head down.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.660
Next, let's capture
your facial expressions.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.673
Smile with your mouth closed.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.903
Then make a big smile
with your teeth showing.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.143
Now raise your eyebrows.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.683
Close your eyes for a moment.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.923
Capture complete.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.223
Put Vision Pro back on to continue.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.370
- I will do that.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:15.303
So now I have a menu that
says Creating Persona,

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.090
and it says it's in beta,

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:23.090
and now there's my Persona right there.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.880
Kind of uncanny.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.453
The hair's a little bit
different, but the face.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.260
Wow, wow.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.093
Okay.

00:29:35.093 --> 00:29:35.926
So there's different lighting.

00:29:35.926 --> 00:29:37.650
You can choose it to always
be in studio lighting,

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.180
and always be in contour lighting.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.140
I'll just leave it at
natural, and hit next.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:47.280
You can change the color
temperature of your skin tone.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.870
Cool to warm, I think I'm around there.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.630
Brightness, darkness.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.113
I think I'm around there, near the middle.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.170
Next.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.190
And then I can add glasses.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.690
So if I typically have glasses,

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.160
which obviously I wouldn't be able to wear

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.130
in the Vision Pro, you can still
look like you have glasses,

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.680
anytime you're on that FaceTime call.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.913
And then next.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:14.363
Save.

00:30:14.363 --> 00:30:15.196
And that's it.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.710
So I think now

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.663
you should see my eyes.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.133
Maybe.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:30.540
And that that's the
thing, it barely shows up.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.840
You can barely see my eyes
when I'm wearing the headset.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.360
Now I've tried a couple
other scans subsequently,

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.220
so I've tried different
lighting conditions,

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.590
I've tried different
backgrounds, simple backgrounds,

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.930
tried different shirts
and things like that.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.850
It doesn't really ever
appear any brighter.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.010
I think if you have a
darker skin tone like me,

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.370
just don't expect the eyes
to show up very brightly

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.420
on the outside of the headset.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.470
It's pretty subtle.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.980
Even when it does show up,
it's a little weird looking.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.500
The eyes are a little
too far apart sometimes.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.670
They're a little dim.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.140
You see one eye at a time.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.760
It's kind of weird.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.787
But that Persona though.

00:31:04.787 --> 00:31:05.620
Whew.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.740
That is some pretty interesting stuff.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.820
It's crazy that this is actually
a real thing being shipped,

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.560
like first Meta started doing it.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.150
Now Apple's doing this.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.700
This is, again, it's technically in beta.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.950
So I dunno, there's room for improvement,

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.000
but it still works.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.730
But as of right now, I feel like this is

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:28.730
both incredibly impressive
and slightly unsettling.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.250
Like, it's very impressive
that this thing,

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.690
this headset I'm wearing on my face,

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:37.590
is tracking all these
little micro expressions

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.990
and little movements for
my eyes and my cheeks

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.120
and my mouth and everything.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.120
But at the same time,
it's just not quite human.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.410
It's right at the edge
of the uncanny valley

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.900
of I'm not looking at a person.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.180
So yeah.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.380
But the crazy part is you
can now use this Persona

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.860
as your camera feed for
any apps in Vision Pro

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:06.600
that require a front facing
camera, like FaceTime.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.480
And so I've tried, I've
been using FaceTime

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.010
a few times in the Vision Pro,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:15.480
and it is, technically
speaking, incredible.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.790
So I've made a few FaceTime
calls in the past few days

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.230
with some fellow reviewers,

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.720
who you'll probably recognize
from their Personas,

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.910
who are also testing the Vision Pro.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:27.540
And universally, once we
all got past the shock of,

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.400
oh my god, it's you.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.720
It looks like a digital version of you.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.553
This is crazy.

00:32:31.553 --> 00:32:33.120
I've never seen anything like this before.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.810
Once we got past that, there
is a ton happening here.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.180
So you can see the FaceTime windows

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.190
literally appear as just that.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:44.130
They're just like glassy
windows floating in space

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.050
with people looking through them.

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:49.530
And then the angle that
you look into the window

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:54.090
is gonna match the angle that
they see you looking at them.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:57.330
Meaning if we're all in
Vision Pros on this call,

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.980
unlikely, but hear me out.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.080
If we're all in Vision Pros,

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.030
and you've got a bunch of
people on this FaceTime call,

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.470
so there's somebody to the left,

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:07.260
and somebody to the right,
if I look to the person,

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.720
and make eye contact with
the person to the right,

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.500
the person to the left
sees the side of my head,

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.410
because I'm looking at somebody else.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:17.940
That's already pretty cool.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.800
And then the same thing
is true for hand gestures.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.940
So we tried this out.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.620
Turns out you can reach out

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.530
and make hand gestures that
are tracked by the cameras

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:26.760
in this bubble in front of you,

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.790
and they show up at the correct angle

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.860
towards the person that
you're gesturing at,

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.470
so not towards everybody else on the call.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.310
Oh wait, wait, wait.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:36.143
Okay, good test.

00:33:36.143 --> 00:33:37.650
So wait, Justine, do you see this?

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:38.483
- Yes.

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:39.316
- And Brian, do you see?
- I don't see that.

00:33:39.316 --> 00:33:40.350
I don't see that, Marques.
- Whoa.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.723
- Now wait.

00:33:41.723 --> 00:33:42.556
So now Brian, do you see this?
(Justine gasps)

00:33:42.556 --> 00:33:43.590
- Now I can see that, Marques.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.750
- And then on top of
that, spatial audio here

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.250
is incredibly well developed.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:50.280
So again, you're on the
call, the voice of the person

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.140
to the right comes from the right side.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.300
The voice of the person to
the left comes from the left.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.970
But also, you can just pick
up and move the window around,

00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:01.410
and that angle will match where
the people are in the room

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.660
and where their sound
and video comes from.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.300
If I put you on the
other side of the room,

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.850
it sounds like they're further away.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.000
And if I turn up the environment,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.380
and bring them into the
moon, or some other 3D space,

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:20.130
it actually sounds much more
like I'm in a gigantic space

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.710
with no echo, versus in the actual room.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:25.470
It's all very subtle,
but very well considered.

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:26.670
So once you're in this a while,

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:29.310
you start to notice all
these little smaller things.

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:31.500
Again, it's not quite human-like.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.203
It's not like looking at a
video feed of a human face,

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.740
but it is still, like
it has a lot of like,

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:40.590
this would be the best avatar
anyone's ever made in 2K.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.240
Like no one's ever done a 2K face scan

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.650
and had it look this good,

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:46.620
but it's still not as
good as a perfect reality.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.770
It's a, you've heard the
uncanny valley thing before.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:52.710
I think the number one
weakness for the avatars

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:55.200
or the Personas that I've seen is hair.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.940
So basically everyone I've talked to has

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.830
like a frozen lump of hair

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.170
instead of flowing realistic hair.

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:02.970
And that's true about all flowing things,

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.580
like however your hair
was when you did the scan,

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.870
it's frozen that way.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.880
And so is any necklace you're wearing,

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.620
whether it's crooked or not,

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.890
or I guess, technically
also any makeup you had on,

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.510
or however you looked
when you did the scan.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.267
Maybe that could be a good thing.

00:35:17.267 --> 00:35:19.080
Maybe you did a scan when you
were looking all dolled up,

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.760
and then you get on a 7:00 AM call,

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.500
and you still look perfect even though

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.030
you look like you just
woke up in real life.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.980
So I guess there's that too.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.440
But anyway, all that is to say FaceTime.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.300
FaceTime is the most well thought out,

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:37.920
like most futuristic
Vision Pro experience.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.753
It just is.

00:35:38.753 --> 00:35:40.380
So I'll end this video with this.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:45.380
Now you know what it's
like to use and operate

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.740
the Vision Pro.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.540
But there's still a lot more to consider

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.640
when actually considering
if you should buy

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.520
and own this thing, from the use cases,

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.220
to the things that work
well, and don't work well,

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.580
the philosophy behind it, the
prices, all of that stuff.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.280
That's what's gonna be for my full review.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.510
Like there are parts of this thing

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.760
that are absolutely amazing,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.250
unparalleled, best I've ever seen.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:09.810
But the reason it's so interesting

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.180
is because it's actually a young category.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.750
Like we're so used to this
slow, boring iteration

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.450
in mature categories, like
smartphones, and laptops,

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:19.500
and you always see the comments

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.540
talking about how tech is so boring,

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.580
but now they're actually
jumping into something risky,

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:27.420
and it's actually fun, and
there is downfalls and flaws,

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.910
and it's fun to actually
weigh the pros and cons.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.590
So I'll be expanding on all these way more

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.510
in the full review, but
I'll leave you with this.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:37.350
I've got my upsides and
downsides to Vision Pro.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.310
It's been a week.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.473
Upsides, some of the stuff
that's the best I've ever seen

00:36:40.473 --> 00:36:41.580
in a headset.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.330
Immersion, placement
in space, eye tracking

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:49.650
and hand control, passthrough, ecosystem,

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:51.420
and spatial audio.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.660
And the downsides, weight and comfort,

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.490
the eyes on the outside,

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:01.290
app selection right now,
battery life, and price.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:03.210
So the full reviews in the works.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.280
Definitely get subscribed
to be among the first

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.080
to see that when it drops.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.660
Either way, till the next one.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.220
Thanks for watching.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.510
Catch you later.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.343
Peace.
