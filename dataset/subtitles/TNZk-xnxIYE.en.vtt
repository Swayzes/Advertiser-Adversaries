00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.460
You've seen a portable projector,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.260
you've seen a CRT,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.280
but have you seen a portable CRT projector?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.720
Okay, portable might be a little generous,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.560
but the Vitamagic FP60 from Sony

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.920
came with its own carrying bag,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.320
has a microphone input for projecting your voice,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.720
and did I mention there's a built-in Betamax player?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.600
No?

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:36.516
How about the fact that it uses a single tube to produce a color image, rather
than three tubes, like most other CRT projectors?

00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:42.516
In this episode of Linus Overpays for Ancient Hardware That You've Probably
Never Heard Of,

00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:46.516
we'll be cosplaying as a traveling salesman from the 1980s.

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:51.516
I can't wait to play with this thing, just like I can't wait to tell you about
our sponsor.

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:56.516
Build Redux. Sometimes computers are hard, but all the time, Build Redux is
easy.

00:00:56.912 --> 00:01:01.672
They'll get a custom PC built and delivered directly to your doorstep. Just
check them out

00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:07.512
at the link down below. According to radiomuseum.org, the introductory price for
the Vidimagic

00:01:07.512 --> 00:01:12.992
FP60 was $3,000 US dollars. That's not that bad for a portable projector,

00:01:13.392 --> 00:01:20.612
except that was in 1984, meaning it would be closer to $9,000 today. That's high
enough that

00:01:20.612 --> 00:01:25.772
just about nobody was going to be buying these for home theater use, but
businesses, 

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.012
well, that's another story.

00:01:28.012 --> 00:01:30.672
And cosmetics giant Avon even went as far

00:01:30.672 --> 00:01:34.032
as to co-brand the FP60 and deploy it

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:36.972
to company representatives across the United States.

00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:40.612
Hence my world's largest makeup bag here.

00:01:41.552 --> 00:01:45.932
At 35 pounds, she's more luggable than really portable.

00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:49.352
But when you compare it to other mid eighties options

00:01:49.352 --> 00:01:52.932
for boardroom presentations, for example, like what?

00:01:52.932 --> 00:01:56.372
A CRT on an AV cart or a reel-to-reel projector?

00:01:56.416 --> 00:02:00.656
The FP60 had major advantages in terms of screen size

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:03.336
and in terms of durability and convenience.

00:02:03.336 --> 00:02:05.476
So we're gonna get to that whole presentation use case,

00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:07.996
but first, I have a burning question.

00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:09.256
Can it game?

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:10.096
Oh yeah.

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:12.276
Fun fact, by the way,

00:02:12.276 --> 00:02:15.816
the NES wouldn't come out in America for another year.

00:02:15.816 --> 00:02:17.796
We just felt like being gamers,

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:20.916
it would be a great choice for us to evaluate the latency.

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:22.136
Not gonna lie, brother.

00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:23.736
I can see it's on, but...

00:02:24.656 --> 00:02:27.496
Wow, barely.

00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:29.556
I mean, is that supposed to be curtains at the top

00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:31.416
or is that just...

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:32.896
There's a reason everyone had blacked out

00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:34.776
media rooms, right?

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:36.396
Okay, we're gonna have to lose some lights.

00:02:36.396 --> 00:02:37.656
Yeah.

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:39.036
Get the lamp.

00:02:39.036 --> 00:02:40.416
There we go.

00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:41.676
Yeah, the lamp doesn't do much.

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:43.156
No, we need that one.

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:44.916
Hold on, I gotcha, I gotcha.

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:45.756
It's still

00:02:46.304 --> 00:02:47.904
horrible!

00:02:47.904 --> 00:02:48.744
Okay, hold on,

00:02:48.744 --> 00:02:49.584
I got this one, I got this one.

00:02:49.584 --> 00:02:50.624
Get the soft box.

00:02:50.624 --> 00:02:51.984
What?

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:55.584
That's the only light we have left and that's all we got?

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:56.424
Turn it off.

00:02:56.424 --> 00:02:57.784
Dude, this is terrible!

00:02:57.784 --> 00:02:59.664
Well, you know, it's a CRT.

00:02:59.664 --> 00:03:00.504
Yeah, but--

00:03:00.504 --> 00:03:01.824
It didn't get very bright to begin with.

00:03:01.824 --> 00:03:03.224
Okay, hold on, hold on.

00:03:04.032 --> 00:03:06.472
That's markedly better.

00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:07.312
We're getting somewhere.

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:08.812
I mean, that's about as far as we're gonna get,

00:03:08.812 --> 00:03:11.492
but that's not bad.

00:03:11.492 --> 00:03:13.072
Okay, that lamp's gotta go.

00:03:13.072 --> 00:03:15.692
That lamp was throwing so much more light

00:03:16.552 --> 00:03:19.692
than the CRT projector.

00:03:19.692 --> 00:03:22.992
With that said, looking into this thing,

00:03:22.992 --> 00:03:25.752
that's about the brightest CRT I've ever seen.

00:03:25.752 --> 00:03:27.332
Right, that Index Tron.

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:28.792
Wow, there's like hairs in there.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:29.632
Oh yeah.

00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:32.764
It'd probably be fun to try to play with the focus

00:03:32.764 --> 00:03:33.964
if you want to.

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:35.384
Basically, that's the cross.

00:03:35.384 --> 00:03:37.384
Oh, it's probably slightly out of focus.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.924
There's also a manual focus on the very front

00:03:40.924 --> 00:03:42.224
that you can use.

00:03:42.224 --> 00:03:44.224
But you shouldn't, don't touch them together

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.564
or you can break the whole focus system.

00:03:46.564 --> 00:03:49.384
Yeah, it's definitely still got some blurry spots.

00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:50.504
Do we have any idea what that is?

00:03:50.504 --> 00:03:52.804
No, Elijah tried cleaning the lens.

00:03:52.804 --> 00:03:54.164
So like it's been wiped down.

00:03:54.164 --> 00:03:55.464
So basically Elijah touched it.

00:03:55.464 --> 00:03:56.944
Yeah, Elijah touched it.

00:03:56.944 --> 00:03:58.364
It was bad before he touched it.

00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:00.033
I'm not blaming him in this scenario.

00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:00.873
Mm.

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.153
Maybe some of the phosphors are worn out or something.

00:04:03.153 --> 00:04:03.993
Or like some of the,

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:05.813
'cause you can see it looks like burn in

00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:10.193
when you've got it on a single like color here.

00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:11.893
Oh my God.

00:04:11.893 --> 00:04:12.733
What?

00:04:12.733 --> 00:04:14.133
This is perfect.

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:14.973
Right?

00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:15.813
There's no latency.

00:04:15.813 --> 00:04:16.633
There's none.

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:17.473
'Cause it's a CRT.

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:18.313
It's a projector.

00:04:18.313 --> 00:04:19.153
Yeah.

00:04:19.153 --> 00:04:19.993
But it's-

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:20.833
A CRT.

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:21.653
A CRT.

00:04:21.653 --> 00:04:22.493
Wow!

00:04:22.493 --> 00:04:23.333
It's like so easy.

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:25.853
This is like freaking easy street.

00:04:25.853 --> 00:04:27.013
 And it looks pretty good, eh?

00:04:27.013 --> 00:04:28.928
Like those blacks actually look pretty black.

00:04:28.928 --> 00:04:32.128
It's pretty colorful too. Like this is not bad. 

00:04:32.128 --> 00:04:37.328
No, it's not bad at all. I mean, it's not good. 

00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:40.368
But in a dark environment though, this is like totally fine.

00:04:40.368 --> 00:04:47.888
Pow pow! Pow pow pow pow pow pow! Pow pow pow pow pow pow!
Oh no! 

00:04:48.272 --> 00:04:49.272
Wow, you did so well.

00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:50.272
Let's see you do better.

00:04:50.272 --> 00:04:51.272
I probably won't.

00:04:51.272 --> 00:04:55.272
Another thing that's not included with ours is a working speaker, unfortunately.

00:04:55.272 --> 00:04:57.272
Yeah, it's just not working.

00:04:57.272 --> 00:05:03.272
And theoretically, we could use our technical manual, service manual to repair
it.

00:05:03.272 --> 00:05:05.272
Or we could just not do that.

00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:07.272
Oh my god.

00:05:07.272 --> 00:05:08.272
You're wasting the pow!

00:05:08.272 --> 00:05:10.272
There's no pow!

00:05:10.272 --> 00:05:11.272
We don't need it.

00:05:11.272 --> 00:05:13.310
I thought you were too good. You don't need the pow.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.270
Did you die?

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.016
Yeah.

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:15.516
Again?

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:18.110
I hit a blue shell while it was flipped over.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.876
We've already realized that when it comes to old games, you'll usually win. New games, I don't know.

00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:27.456
Okay, well that was you dying on purpose. 

00:05:27.456 --> 00:05:28.456
I actually did not.

00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:33.456
Okay, alright, this is it. For all the marbles. Here we go.

00:05:35.056 --> 00:05:36.156
Um, it killed me.

00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:42.852
Yeah. Yeah, they kill you if they're, um, moving. Yeah. This feels too
good.

00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:44.852
I know, right? Like, it feels like you're playing on a CRT.

00:05:44.852 --> 00:05:52.352
Yeah, because the only additional latency compared to looking directly into a
CRT is the speed of light to the screen. That's it.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:59.852
So just the slightly increased, like, distance the light has to travel. Like,
this is awesome.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.284
The blue, we're getting about 2.2 nits.

00:06:02.304 --> 00:06:03.564
2.2 nits!

00:06:04.324 --> 00:06:05.944
The .2 matters!

00:06:07.164 --> 00:06:09.924
Let's stop it for now, because I want to talk about brightness.

00:06:10.424 --> 00:06:15.584
In fairness, most projectors don't get that bright compared to direct-view
displays.

00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:23.004
But this is clearly way behind the experience that Sony showed off in this, by
the way,

00:06:23.404 --> 00:06:29.004
amazing promotional video that was recently re-uploaded by Retro TV Film &amp;
Video.

00:06:29.408 --> 00:06:34.408
And if we look closely, yep, composited, got 'em.

00:06:36.268 --> 00:06:38.588
Now, it was probably brighter when it was new.

00:06:38.588 --> 00:06:40.788
CRTs do decay over time,

00:06:40.788 --> 00:06:42.528
but they show this thing being usable

00:06:42.528 --> 00:06:45.648
in a literally sunlit room when realistically,

00:06:45.648 --> 00:06:48.688
it would have needed pitch darkness even then.

00:06:48.688 --> 00:06:53.168
With that said, how cool would a LAN party have been

00:06:53.168 --> 00:06:55.168
if someone showed up with one of these bad boys?

00:06:55.168 --> 00:06:56.368
Oh, it'd be sick with like a giant,

00:06:56.368 --> 00:06:58.080
even, not even a hundred, 80.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.560
50, 60 inches, that'd be unheard of as a kid.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.580
Unheard of.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.800
A regular CRT tube TV works by coating the front glass

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.000
with a phosphor material that lights up

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.060
when it gets zapped by one of three electron guns.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.560
One for red, one for green, and one for blue.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.840
With our CRT projector,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.780
we're not looking at a lit up phosphor screen.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.752
So, what is going on here?

00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:28.592
it turns out it's surprisingly simple. They're still using a cathode ray tube to
generate the

00:07:28.592 --> 00:07:34.912
image, and we can see that if we look directly down the barrel but it's upside
down and backwards

00:07:34.912 --> 00:07:40.352
so that once it goes through the lens which is basically functioning as a giant
magnifying glass

00:07:40.352 --> 00:07:45.312
it'll be the right way around now i alluded to this before but one of the big
innovations for

00:07:45.312 --> 00:07:52.432
the vidimagic was that most CRT projectors in those days were using three
separate tubes and lenses

00:07:52.432 --> 00:07:59.712
for R, G and B. Kind of like this. They were reliable but they were extremely heavy
and

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:05.552
inconvenient to set up supposedly it took quite some time to get them all lined
up correctly

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:10.272
and something as small as a swift kick to the table it was resting on could put
the whole thing

00:08:10.272 --> 00:08:15.152
out of whack again. Another major hurdle they faced was well you could probably
guess from

00:08:15.152 --> 00:08:21.552
what we've seen so far brightness. CRTs by modern standards are pretty dim to
begin with

00:08:21.808 --> 00:08:29.008
and projecting that light across a much larger area exacerbates the issue. How do
you fix all that?

00:08:29.888 --> 00:08:38.928
Okay, the fp60 is no regular CRT, it uses a single electron gun with a beam index
tube so to get the

00:08:38.928 --> 00:08:44.368
right colors from a single gun they would modulate the beam strength then there
was a

00:08:44.368 --> 00:08:49.888
fourth phosphor stripe and when that lit up the result was captured by a photo
multiplier tube,

00:08:50.128 --> 00:08:53.708
and that signal was then amplified and sent to a decoder circuit

00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:59.808
which would basically check if the colors were correct and then adjust the
modulation of the beam on the fly.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:06.428
If you open this thing up the number of boards involved to properly index and to
decode the signals is

00:09:06.728 --> 00:09:10.628
pretty wild. By the way shoutout to 12 volt vids for this

00:09:10.868 --> 00:09:16.628
amazing footage from his repair video a few years ago that gives us a great look
by the way at the water cooling

00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:18.788
that was built into this projector.

00:09:19.056 --> 00:09:25.236
Now this design did have drawbacks like inferior contrast, but the benefits were
brighter images,

00:09:25.236 --> 00:09:32.336
no convergence problems and lower sensitivity to magnetic interference, which is
why they saw some military use.

00:09:33.056 --> 00:09:37.996
Sony commercialized a couple of versions of this technology including the index
Tron tube

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:42.116
Which was used in our fp60 as well as in the highly sought-after

00:09:42.676 --> 00:09:45.896
KVX 370 watch cube. A super cute

00:09:46.144 --> 00:09:49.604
four inch bedside TV that came out in 1989.

00:09:50.544 --> 00:09:53.704
Realistically, nobody was buying this thing for gaming.

00:09:53.704 --> 00:09:56.024
So why don't we try a movie?

00:09:56.024 --> 00:09:59.024
This definitely makes these 1980s special effects

00:09:59.024 --> 00:10:00.564
not look out of place.

00:10:00.564 --> 00:10:01.404
Yeah.

00:10:01.404 --> 00:10:04.844
I mean, they look pretty good at this resolution.

00:10:04.844 --> 00:10:06.064
Yeah.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:06.904
At this brightness.

00:10:06.904 --> 00:10:10.424
Gotta love those four textures, not 4K, just four.

00:10:12.284 --> 00:10:15.364
This looks about how I remember watching TV.

00:10:15.392 --> 00:10:16.432
In the '90s.

00:10:16.432 --> 00:10:17.272
No.

00:10:17.272 --> 00:10:19.352
We had more color than that.

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:20.192
Ah.

00:10:20.192 --> 00:10:23.192
The contrast is terrible.

00:10:23.192 --> 00:10:24.492
Fine, yeah.

00:10:24.492 --> 00:10:25.772
Terrible. 

00:10:25.772 --> 00:10:27.952
So I guess what we wanna know

00:10:27.952 --> 00:10:29.752
is how much of what we're looking at

00:10:29.752 --> 00:10:32.892
is limitations of the Betamax format

00:10:32.892 --> 00:10:35.172
and/or degradation of the tape,

00:10:35.172 --> 00:10:37.132
versus how much of it is limitations

00:10:37.132 --> 00:10:39.052
of the performance of our projector.

00:10:39.052 --> 00:10:40.512
So do we wanna throw our DVD on?

00:10:40.512 --> 00:10:41.712
Yeah, let's put our DVD in.

00:10:41.712 --> 00:10:42.912
I think it's already in the player.

00:10:42.912 --> 00:10:43.520
Okay.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.360
I love how delightfully easy to operate this thing is.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.480
Yeah, it's pretty simple.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.340
Switches for different modes.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.180
Yep.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.480
This looks better.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.000
I think that other than getting 16 by 9.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.520
Which we can actually kind of take advantage of

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.700
with this projector.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.540
That's true.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.880
Because the image isn't so small

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.480
that you are basically just like,

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.480
"Well, I gave up 30% of my whole screen."

00:11:11.936 --> 00:11:15.456
I don't think this is a whole ton better though,

00:11:15.456 --> 00:11:16.296
like a little bit.

00:11:16.296 --> 00:11:17.136
I think it's a little better.

00:11:17.136 --> 00:11:18.176
A little bit.

00:11:18.176 --> 00:11:19.276
Looking into the lens,

00:11:19.276 --> 00:11:22.896
this is as bright a CRT as I have ever seen.

00:11:22.896 --> 00:11:25.976
How small does it get to be CRT bright

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:28.176
off the projection screen?

00:11:28.176 --> 00:11:29.016
I'm gonna move it.

00:11:29.016 --> 00:11:30.076
Okay, move it forward.

00:11:30.076 --> 00:11:33.376
Careful, this is like 60, 80 pounds worth of stuff.

00:11:33.376 --> 00:11:34.276
I got you, I got you.

00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:35.116
Oh yeah, I got it.

00:11:35.116 --> 00:11:35.956
You're good, you nailed it.

00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:36.796
Hang on, yeah.

00:11:36.848 --> 00:11:40.028
Wow, that's still really dim.

00:11:40.028 --> 00:11:43.088
Okay, more.

00:11:43.088 --> 00:11:46.508
I think that's as much as it goes.

00:11:46.508 --> 00:11:47.348
Oh boy.

00:11:47.348 --> 00:11:49.268
So we can't go any smaller than this.

00:11:49.268 --> 00:11:52.948
All right, so it's not great for watching movies either,

00:11:52.948 --> 00:11:56.348
but there were advantages to using a CRT projector,

00:11:56.348 --> 00:12:00.968
even when LCD and DLP options started hitting the market.

00:12:00.968 --> 00:12:03.936
Better black levels and better flesh tones.

00:12:03.936 --> 00:12:07.436
No pixelation, and exceptionally long tube life. 

00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:17.436
Most CRT projectors were rated
for around 10,000 hours, while the bulbs in LCD and DLP projectors were only
good for one or two thousand.

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:20.112
They'd also gotten pretty cheap on the used market by then, 

00:12:20.112 --> 00:12:27.112
so you could go with the used CRT projector and still have money left over to spend on the new Noctua
screwdriver from lttstore.com 

00:12:27.112 --> 00:12:30.112
to take it apart when you need to change the tube.

00:12:30.112 --> 00:12:37.552
By the way guys, we've got a full service manual for this thing and a second
projector, let us know in the comments if you want to see Dan try to fix it.

00:12:37.552 --> 00:12:42.352
With all of that said, these benefits were not enough to keep CRT projectors in
fashion.

00:12:42.352 --> 00:12:46.432
Like their TV set brethren, they were replaced by lighter, brighter models, 

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:52.432
even if it meant sacrificing a little bit of image quality for, actually, years to
come.

00:12:52.432 --> 00:12:58.472
And the last CRT projector came out in 2001, the Pro 1200X from Zenith.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.480
It retailed for about $30,000 and weighed around 155 pounds.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.000
By contrast, the high-end Christie Mirage 2000 DLP projector

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.040
launched in the same year for 55 grand,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.520
but weighed almost half of what the Zenith did

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.580
and was roughly seven times brighter.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.120
Modern projectors have obviously gotten a lot better

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.780
by the way, and we'll have some decent options

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:21.980
linked down below.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.700
Back to our FP60 though.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.232
The only thing we haven't done yet is give a presentation.

00:13:27.232 --> 00:13:29.352

00:14:21.888 --> 00:14:23.808
That was a ton of fun.

00:14:23.808 --> 00:14:26.168
They really do look like records, except...

00:14:26.208 --> 00:14:28.208
shiny like a CD.

00:14:28.208 --> 00:14:30.208
Oh no. We're gonna do VideoDisc next?

00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:32.208
Okay, I don't know. We'll see.
