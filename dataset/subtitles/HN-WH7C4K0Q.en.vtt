00:00:00.078 --> 00:00:03.270
(Intro music)

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.770
- That's crazy that the
most interesting things

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.250
about this new laptop are
the reasons not to buy it.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.350
So the MacBook Air just got refreshed.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.130
It's a pretty simple update,
maybe a boring one actually.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.450
There's really only two things new.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.760
It has this new
anodization on the outside,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.570
apparently a slightly more
fingerprint resistant look to it.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.790
And it has the new M3 chip inside.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.080
So the coating, I don't know,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.390
it barely makes a difference
if I'm being honest.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.730
It still gets fingerprints
if you handle it regularly

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.140
without a skin or a case.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.660
I would much rather depend
on something like a skin

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.950
from channel sponsor Dbrand.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.660
It lets you break out
from one of the three

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.330
really simple colors and
it's gonna hide fingerprints

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.940
a million times better than
any metal treatment ever could.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.050
Plus these are real leather,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.580
so they have a nice plush texture

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.780
and it'll patina over time.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.460
So I'll leave a link to this one below.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.280
But the other new thing
is this M3 chip inside.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.820
So we've seen this M3 chip
before, this is what Apple does.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.110
They put the same chip everywhere.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.900
This came out in October of last year

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.000
and they immediately
put it in the new iMac.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.040
And then we also got a new
MacBook Pro that launched

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.190
with this and the M3 PRO and the M3 Max.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.420
So okay, new M3 Apple silicon,
third generation, great.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.820
So now we're finally getting
this new base M3 chip

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.320
in the new MacBook Air, side
note, why does it take so long?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.780
I don't know, it feels like
Apple kind of staggers it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.380
probably on purpose, but like
it's the same chip everywhere.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.540
They've done the iMac,
they've done the MacBook Pro

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.900
and MacBook Air, but the
Mac Mini just staying

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.610
on M2, kind of weird.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.520
Also the new iPad Pro still on M2.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.630
When's that gonna get it?

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.820
Anyway, you already know
that the MacBook Air

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.160
is the most popular Mac for a reason.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.070
This is the base like entry level Mac

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.090
that most people are seeing

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.000
as the way to get into the Mac world.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.160
And so the base MacBook
Air has typically been one

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.340
of the easiest to recommend
laptops in the world by design.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.260
But this one, interestingly,
for two reasons, isn't.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.780
Now, this has nothing to
do with performance of M3

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.890
or anything weird like that.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.750
Like it's the performance
you were expecting.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.660
If you look at benchmarks,
it's right around that 10

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.100
to 20% improvement over M2

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.330
depending on what you're doing.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.470
Definitely leans heavier

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.600
on graphics improvements this generation.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.370
And there's the rate tracing now finally.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.390
So any applications

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.730
or rendering that are
taken advantage of that,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.380
that's gonna be a noticeable
improvement for M3.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.150
And it's clearly a more capable chip.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.310
And also MacBook Airs,
especially the 15 inch,

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.130
just constantly get great
battery life across the board.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.430
You also get now dual
external display support

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.930
with the lid closed,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.330
but one external display
with the laptop open.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.350
And it also appears

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.310
that the base storage
on M3 is much improved.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.840
So this was one of those concerns from,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.190
if you look back at M2,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.560
you know obviously Apple seeds reviewers

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.380
with higher end MacBooks, so
most of us aren't getting that.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.850
But if you look back at M2

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.960
the base 256 gig model used
a single SSD module instead

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.070
of two SSDs.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.490
Long story short, that
storage module was way slower

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.520
than M1, like 50% slower on paper.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.860
Would you have noticed if nobody told you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.050
and had never benchmarked it?

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.210
Maybe, possibly not,

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.120
but obviously it's a bummer
having way slower storage

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.690
on a new M2 and that extra
time transferring large files,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.680
that adds up over time.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.530
So I'm happy to report that
I've seen really good benchmarks

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.590
on the base storage of the M3 Air.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.870
It appears that they fixed it, awesome.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.340
So what's the deal with this M3 Air then?

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.780
Why am I saying it's not necessarily

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.830
the best recommendation?

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.950
Well, historically, MacBook
Air has been super easy

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.590
to recommend, but with this M3,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.640
they also lowered the price
of M2 by a hundred bucks

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.890
and discontinued the M1.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.480
So now the lineup is M3
MacBook Air starts at 1099,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.020
then M2 MacBook Air starts at 999

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.200
and then M1, it's kind of gone from Apple,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.670
but you can still find stock

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.070
that's left at like Walmart or Best Buy.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.830
Now the thing about the
MacBook Air being easy

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.410
to recommend is we're
talking about regular people,

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.110
which it's very light, regular,

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.860
normal usage like web browsing,
listening to music, a bunch

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.920
of tabs open, work stuff,
occasionally compiling

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.080
or rendering some small
things, photo editing

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.150
and chopping a video or two sometimes,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.410
but really very light.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.390
So these people, like type of people

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.162
who would buy a laptop at
Walmart would be totally fine

00:04:17.162 --> 00:04:21.630
with the cheaper identical
looking MacBook Air

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.820
with the slightly slower
M2 chip and slower storage.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.910
I think they would be totally fine.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.100
But the other thing which
I need to talk about

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.040
is this whole base spec thing.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.730
This is not exactly new to the
industry, but the base price

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.140
and the base spec has almost
become like this weird fallacy.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.640
Like I think it was Linus who did a video

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.880
about how starting at is
like the biggest lie in tech.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.620
And he's right, it's not just tech,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.960
like the car industry
does it all the time too.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.330
Starting at, you know,
this super low price,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.490
but nobody actually gets it at that price.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.370
You're not gonna get a
totally bare base model car.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.680
The base price is really
more to give you an idea

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.270
of how much you're about to spend

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.030
when you actually option
it up the way you want to.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.870
And the issue with these
is Apple's markup prices

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.440
for above base spec is crazy high.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.470
Like Apple charges way too much
for the most basic upgrades.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.720
Obviously Apple Silicon
computers are all a system

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.090
on a chip, so they cannot be upgraded ever

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.410
after you buy them, right?

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.000
So once you buy it, you know, you're kind

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.400
of incentivized if you're
gonna keep it for a long time

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.720
to splurge a little bit

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.510
and give yourself some extra
headroom and future proof it

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.860
and bump up that spec.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.800
But Apple charges so much
for bumping up that spec

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.781
that the base price feels
like kind of even more

00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:36.390
of a lie than usual.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.720
So the MacBook Air starts in 2024,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.720
again, at eight gigs of shared
RAM and 256 gigs of storage.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.910
Now, ignoring the fact that
the phone I'm using also has

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.080
more than eight gigs of RAM

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.760
and 256 gigs of storage, if
you want to upgrade to 16 gigs

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.140
of memory, the first available
RAM upgrade, that's $200.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.360
And if you wanna bump up
to just the half a terabyte

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.720
of storage, that's
another 200 more dollars.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.610
Compared to to how much
that actually costs Apple,

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.650
especially at the scale
that they're operating,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.530
that is just crazy,
brutal, ridiculous pricing.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.750
So even if you do just that,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.080
suddenly the MacBook Air M3 is $1,500.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.360
So either you're cool with
knowing you're actually buying

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.692
a 1500 plus dollars MacBook
Air or the real question is,

00:06:22.692 --> 00:06:27.630
is the base spec in 2024 actually usable?

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.630
And my take is actually
sometimes yes, sometimes yes.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.010
So again, if you're the
people I talked about earlier,

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.070
you're you're buying a laptop
from the showcase at Walmart

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.830
or Best Buy, you just need
it to do the basic stuff

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.670
I mentioned earlier,

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.460
you actually can do that with eight gigs

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.260
of shared memory, no problem.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.640
This might seem like a hot take,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.650
but I've spent a lot of
time doing this stuff.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.320
You rarely actually get
close to hitting the max

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.550
and hitting memory swap.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.130
And even when you do,
it's very much still fine.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.010
It's when you get into the
heavier stuff like media encoding

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.760
or exporting or gaming that
it's a whole nother story.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.380
So if you're watching this video,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.780
you already know which
group of people you're in.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.720
So for that massive group of
people who are doing a lot of

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.769
that normal, baseline computing stuff,

00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:16.080
don't buy the new M3 MacBook Air.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.630
You can very easily get an M2 MacBook Air

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.680
and save your money.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.040
Matter of fact, if you don't
need the brighter display,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.950
the MagSafe, the external display support,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.960
which you probably don't at this rate,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.810
it's also a great idea
to look into Best Buy

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.810
or Walmart's like six,
$700 M1 MacBook Airs

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.953
that they're selling right now.

00:07:36.953 --> 00:07:39.480
I think Walmart first announced
they would have it for 699

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.460
and then a few days
later Best Buy announced

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.640
that they'd sell it for
649, which is pretty sick.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.580
So clearly M3 is a much
more capable overall chip

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.230
and brings the floor of a laptop up.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.380
But the way I see it, what
Apple silicon has done

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.380
to Apple's lineup is it's
brought down the minimum level

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.920
of machine that you can get
away with doing your workflow.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.753
Does that make sense?

00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:05.310
So like me, I edit a lot of videos

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.400
and so I need a powerful
machine for Final Cut Pro

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.170
and that sort of stuff, right?

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.980
So for the longest time I could
only use an Apple Desktop,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.030
the highest end iMac Pro, the
Mac Pro, and I still will,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.920
but I am now able to use Mac
Studio and I can actually edit.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.860
I've had an M1 Max MacBook Pro for a while

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.310
and I've been editing
on the go with a laptop,

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.610
which is a huge like enabler for me.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.590
And the same sort of thing
applies if you're doing like

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.260
gaming stuff or if you have
a whole bunch of coding

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.810
and heavy, maybe even just encoding photos

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:42.210
or whatever you're doing at that level,

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.090
you'd typically rely on a MacBook Pro.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.640
But with these new chips
and with Apple silicon,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.640
you can do that on a high-end
MacBook Air, which is again,

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.820
a pretty sweet enabler.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.010
So that's what the new M3 MacBook Air is.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.530
If you do that sort of stuff,
it's an amazing computer.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.910
It should be on your shortlist.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.620
Great all around, easy to recommend.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.950
But again, if you're doing
the lightweight, normal stuff

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.950
and you need a MacBook
Air, don't get this one.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.540
Get the cheaper one.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.561
Okay, that's it.

00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:11.913
Thanks for watching.

00:09:11.913 --> 00:09:14.463
Catch you guys the next one, peace.

00:09:15.945 --> 00:09:18.786
