00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.837
My friend Mac is about to experience
the scariest moment of his life.

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:06.272
I'm just going to let you know
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.941
- We'll see.
- You cannot scare me.

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:09.075
Seal him up.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.013
You have to survive 10 minutes
with a thousand spiders to move on.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.382
Release the spiders.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.051
Start the timer.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:22.522
The reason we're doing
this is because

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.792
Mack said no matter how hard I tried,
I can't scare him.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:27.260
Would you say you're scared now?

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:28.628
Getting there a little bit.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:29.596
- A little bit?
- Yeah.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.500
And this is only one of many fears
Mack will face in this video.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:35.001
Oh, good.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:39.839
And if he can successfully face all
of the fears, he will win $800,000.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.041
I'm not going to lie,

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.209
this was way more gnarly
than I thought it would be.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.578
Three, two, one.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:46.946
Lift it up. Lift it up.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.847
Oh yeah.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.617
Congratulations on passing
the first challenge.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.818
Let's go.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.087
But Mack has to finish
all of these fears

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.790
if he wants to win
the $800,000 prize.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.092
Mack, I know you're blindfolded,
but trust me.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.360
Just walk up this ramp.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.828
Raise us up.

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:04.564
Why are you taking a knee?

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.099
What is...?

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:08.068
Stand up. Stand up.
You're fine. You're fine.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.103
No, no, no, no.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:10.770
All right, Jimmy.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.538
Okay, you can hold on to it.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.539
That's cute.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.008
Oh my God!

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.109
Okay.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.278
Mack, take off your blindfold.

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.814
Welcome to challenge number two.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.584
The next fear
is the fear of heights.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.553
You're going to stand
on the end of that plank,

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.089
unclip this so you'll be
connected to nothing.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:29.923
Nah, dude.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:33.526
Press that button
and then freefall 200 feet,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.995
and without knowing how,
trust, I'll catch you.

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.297
No! No!

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.997
You're shaking.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.299
Yeah, of course I'm shaking.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.734
I'm going to fall off of this
without a harness on.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.603
- Yeah.
- I can't even see the ground.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:45.905
Be very careful.

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.040
Mack, I'm just going to tell you,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.709
even though you can't see
the ground, you are very, very high.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.444
Oh, my God, Mack.

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:54.481
All you have to do is unclip it
and press that button.

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:55.815
Oh my...

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.285
I want you to look at me
in the eyes right now

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.489
and tell me that I'm going to fall
and something's going to catch me.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.324
Something will break your fall.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.325
I promise.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:06.359
Oh my...

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.495
You're literally attached to nothing.

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.395
Oh, my God.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.598
- The clip is gone.
- Oh, my God.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.267
You don't have to do it.

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:15.034
If you want to,

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:17.804
you can tap out and just admit
that you are wrong and

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:18.938
you do get scared.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.042
No way.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.514
God, dude.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.618
I would have to say
you look pretty scared.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.319
Oh, my God.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.689
Five, four,

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.691
three, two...

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:42.228
one.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:43.530
Godspeed.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:44.631
Godspeed.

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:45.398
Zero.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.711
Let's go!

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.213
I can't believe you did it.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.548
He's a psycho.

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.351
And if you're wondering
who my psychotic friend Mack is

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.087
he's actually a contestant
from a previous challenge video.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.057
And sadly,
he ended up losing $800,000.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:13.159
But now he is on challenge
three of six

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.061
to attempt to win that money back.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.296
Here we are.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:18.364
- Yeah.
- The next challenge.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.435
What'd you get? A $5 car and put
$800,000 inside of it?

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:24.837
As you can see,
this car is pointed towards a lake.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:28.074
I'm guessing you're going to want me
to drive the car into the lake?

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:29.642
No. That would be dangerous.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.678
As you can see,
there's no gas pedal.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.479
Obviously,
you can't drive it in the lake.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.614
Yeah, I'm so stupid.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.549
Why would I think
that I can drive it into the lake?

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.850
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Stupid. Yeah.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.485
Which is why we're going to drop him
in the lake.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:40.620
Bring in the crane!

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:44.457
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.526
It is getting real now.
Okay.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.461
Oh, my God.

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:49.963
Oh, my God.

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:52.098
All right, Mack,
listen up and listen good.

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:55.635
Once we drop you at this lake,
the car will quickly begin to sink.

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:56.936
And in the back seat is

00:03:56.936 --> 00:04:00.740
the 800 grand you've been competing
for divvied up into eight duffel bags.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.410
However many bags you can save
from this sinking car determines

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.113
how much money you'll continue
competing for in this video.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.415
And whatever you leave
behind is gone forever.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.317
Oh my gosh, dude.

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:13.353
I will never tell you
that I'm scared,

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:16.623
but I'm about as close
as you can be right now to that feeling.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:17.557
I can tell.

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:20.293
Before we drop your car, I'm
going to give you a one offer.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:23.096
If you quit right now
and admit I scared you,

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.064
I'll give you $100,000.

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:26.232
And we call it even.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:29.102
Yeah.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:29.736
All right.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:30.503
He's not going to take it.

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:32.939
- There's not a gosh darn chance.
- I knew that was going...

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.141
Hey, Nolan, take that.
I knew he was going to do this.

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.476
I lost it all last time.

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:37.543
It's not happening again.

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:38.578
Three!

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:40.380
Two!

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:41.381
One!

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:42.482
Oh, my God.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.383
Drop him!

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:54.060
Hey Mack! You've got about 20 seconds
to break out of that car

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.962
before it sinks under the water.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.270
Mack, the car is going under.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.171
Hurry up.

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:15.014
Oh, God.

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:29.028
That car is gone.

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:30.930
That sunk so fast.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.733
Oh, my God. He's out. He's alive.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:34.867
Hey Mack!

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.369
Nolan, go grab that bag from him.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.171
Somebody grab this.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.376
The scariest part about this
challenge is every second

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:46.713
the car sinks deeper into the water,
making it harder to get to

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.081
and harder to see.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.249
So if Mack wants to keep
all of the prize money.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:53.019
He really needs to be moving
as fast as possible.

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.755
But as you can see,
that's not going to be easy.

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:08.968
Nolan, come here.
Take it.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.805
Mack continued saving bag.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:14.607
Oh my God.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.576
After bag, after bag.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:18.845
Mack, you're crazy.

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:21.948
But on top of the fact that the car
is sinking deeper and deeper.

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:25.284
What Mack hasn't realized yet
is that the last two bags of money

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:28.621
are actually seatbelted
into the back seat of the car.

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:44.637
Dude, Mack could be in an action movie,
honestly.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.874
Well, he was like a borderline
Olympic swimmer earlier in his life,

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.242
which is why I did this fear.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:52.945
Yeah, but it's like 40 feet down
and the water is freezing cold.

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:54.747
How can you hold your breath out?

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:01.921
He got another bag.

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:03.723
Well, you got $700,000 on the boat.

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:05.391
Just stop now.
Just stop now.

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.993
Just leave it on the bottom of lake.

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:08.561
- We can do the next.
- No.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.130
All right.
He doesn't care.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.831
At this point,

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:15.568
the car was literally at the bottom
of this 45 foot deep lake,

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:20.139
making it almost impossible for Mack
to retrieve the last $100,000.

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.974
Yeah you know,
I really cannot.

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:23.176
It's black down there.
There's nothing.

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:24.477
Are you officially calling it?

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:26.679
I can't see the car, Jimmy.
It's gone, yes.

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:28.247
The boat's tilting.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:29.749
You are very athletic.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:32.051
Do you like this video better
or the other video better?

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.254
Dude, this video is
like 10 times as intense.

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:35.655
I know.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:38.391
And even though this looks very crazy,
there's actually seven

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:41.294
safety divers on standby
to make sure Mack didn't die.

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.162
Your prize is now 700 grand,

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:45.498
but from here on out, it's
all or nothing.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.800
Mack has to face
the three remaining fears

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.102
to walk out of this
with his 700 grand.

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:52.638
- This one might be the hardest one.
- Okay

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:53.906
Is it grosser than spiders?

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:54.640
Just come on in.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.843
Inside this room is a metal box.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.044
In order to progress,

00:07:58.044 --> 00:08:01.247
you'll need to reach inside the box
and pull out what's inside.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.682
And before
you put your hand in the box,

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:03.816
we're going to need you
to sign this.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:04.951
It just basically says that

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:07.019
you can't sue me
if anything in there hurts you.

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:09.522
Just sign right there.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:12.492
All right, we got it signed.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.960
What is it,
like an animal or something?

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.562
There are things in this box.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.997
Just step up here.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.665
You put your hand
in one of these holes.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:20.066
Okay.

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:22.101
And there's a thing in here
you need to pull out.

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.470
Dude, that is freaky as...
Okay.

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:26.105
I'm just going to make sure it's moving.

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:27.240
- Stop.
- Okay, go for it.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.042
Clearly it has not touched him yet.

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:33.246
No matter what, once you grab onto it,
you have to pull it out.

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:42.688
What you grabbed

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:45.391
is our brand new Feastable bars.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:49.195
We got all new branding
and a better tasting formula.

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:51.297
- Let's try it together.
- I am not going to go soft on you.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.832
I'm going to tell you
honestly what I think.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.701
Okay, that's pretty good.

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:58.304
The new formula is milkier, creamier.

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:01.007
We have our all new crunch flavor,
the milk chocolate flavor,

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.576
almond flavor, my personal favorite,
and peanut butter.

00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:06.178
These new and improved
Feastables bars are rolling out now.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.780
Give us a couple of days
to get them on the shelves

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.749
of your local Walmart,
Target, 7-Eleven.

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:11.784
And I cannot wait
to see what you think of them.

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.653
All right, Mack,
you ready for the next fear?

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:15.488
Jimmy,
I've been in this exact same room,

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:17.156
and I've had a bunch of money
on the line before.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:17.790
Yeah.

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:18.524
I'll tell you what.

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:21.794
If you give me 500 grand right now,
I'll walk.

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:22.995
Do you guys hear this man?

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:25.264
- Jimmy.
- Who asked for $500,000?

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:26.499
- 400 grand?
- No.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:26.999
Hear me out.

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:30.169
If you said 200, maybe 250,
I would have considered it.

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:31.938
- How about 350?
- No.

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:34.240
All right, let's go.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.308
Next challenge.

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:36.275
I knew he'd break.

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:37.677
All right, I might've lied.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.178
That one wasn't actually that hard.

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:42.481
But this next one is actually based
on one of the scariest things

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:43.182
I've ever done.

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:44.417
There's no way.

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:46.886
How about quickly he pieced it together?

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.721
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
There's actually no way.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.890
- Come on.
- There is actually no way, Jimmy.

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:52.191
Is it that obvious what it is?

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:54.827
What gave it away?
The tombstone with your name?

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:55.928
Oh, Jesus.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:10:00.166
For the next challenge, we are going
to bury you alive for 24 hours.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.302
No way, dude.

00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:05.004
And you can get out
whatever you want,

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:06.939
but you don't know what time it is.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:09.875
And if you leave before the 24 hour
mark, you'll lose everything.

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:11.611
That's a good fear.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:12.445
Yes.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:14.747
For once, I'm on the other side.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.748
Yeah bro!

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:16.949
Oh, my gosh.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.551
It might get a little cold.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.486
Nolan, don't mess it up, please.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:21.420
I'll try not to.

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.522
This is from my nightmares, man.

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:26.459
It feels wrong being on
the other side, but also fun.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.928
What the...

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:31.130
Oh, this is so freaky.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.500
The funny thing is that
the timer hasn't even started yet

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.501
because you aren't fully buried.

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:39.171
It feels wrong saying this,
but can you bury me faster?

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:40.339
As you wish, Mack!

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:41.574
Bring in the extra hand.

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:44.010
Stop it, stop it, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.580
Let's officially start the timer.

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:50.716
Looks like 24 hours just started

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:52.184
and I'm already freaked,

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:53.452
so this ain't going to be good.

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:56.022
Mack, see that rope above your head?
Can you pull it for me real quick?

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:57.356
- Is this a trick?
- No.

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:01.394
Next time you pull that bell,
we will dig you up.

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:04.897
And if it does not say above
24 hours, you lose everything.

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.232
I will burn your house down.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.669
And also the $700,000.

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:11.303
Yeah, I was like everything?

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.406
Everything.
Sweet dreams Macketh!

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:14.974
All right, don't throw the walkie talkie.

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:17.009
Was it that predictable?

00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:19.512
I already know they threw it,
and I'm not even up there.

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:21.480
There's so much more fun
to be on this side of it.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.849
And to make sure Mack doesn't die
in his own grave.

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:25.351
He's going to be wearing
this wristband

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.653
that directly tells us
his heart rate and vitals.

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:30.623
And no, it does not give him any way
of knowing what time it is.

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:32.858
Basically, I need to figure out
how to keep track of the time.

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:33.993
Here's my strategy.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:37.363
I could try to stay awake
for 2 hours, sleep

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.233
for 10 hours, and then I would be
halfway done with the challenge

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.502
and I could just do that twice
and that would be good.

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:45.204
With Mack's plan now in place,

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:47.940
his first step was to pass
the time for the next 2 hours.

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:49.141
Well, it's no Feastable bar,

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:51.210
but I guess that makes hunger stop.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.913
But it was pretty obvious
he was quickly getting bored.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.952
Dude, you got to be honest,
there’s not much going on inside this room.

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:01.687
That's the whole point.

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:03.989
And Mack being bored this early

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:07.193
is a pretty telltale sign
that he may not be too good at this

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:08.160
because already

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.498
within 45 minutes, Mack's idea of time
was horrendously off.

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:14.200
I think it's been about 2 hours.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.101
I'm going to try to get about

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:18.404
10 hours of sleep, which should
put me at the halfway mark.

00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:22.608
Even though the pro to sleeping
is that it'll help Mack past time faster.

00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:24.276
First night sleeping in the coffin.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.012
The con is it's very difficult
for him to keep track

00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:30.116
of how long he's been buried,
especially when he's not even able

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:32.585
to stay asleep
for more than 30 minutes at a time.

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:35.554
I have no idea what time it is right now.

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:37.056
I'm a little creeped out.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.560
Hopefully for the love of God it's
been over 12 hours.

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.629
I think that's where we're at.

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:44.163
And because

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:47.433
when I did the challenge, I was
constantly woken up by my friends...

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.368
Jimmy Jam.

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:52.505
I thought I'd give Mack the same
joyful experience.

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:53.973
Wake up, Mack.
Are you okay?

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:57.643
Dude, you look like
you just got hit by a truck.

00:12:57.743 --> 00:12:59.912
Kind of feels like
I did just get hit by a truck.

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:01.981
If I was to legitimately guess
how many hours in I am,

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:02.915
I think it's like...

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.886
The longer Mack stayed in the coffin,

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:09.455
the less he seemed to know
what time it was.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.260
It might be hour 16.

00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:17.329
And because we like to build
a lot of suspense on this channel

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.298
for the remainder of this fear,

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.901
you're not going to know
how long he's been in there either.

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:25.638
And even though Mack
wanted to ensure

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.573
that he was going to be there
long enough,

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:29.775
it was clear that claustrophobia
was getting to him.

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:32.378
Being in this coffin is scary.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:33.979
Like...

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:35.748
That...

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:38.584
And the longer I'm in here,
the worse I feel.

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.352
It's a crazy feeling.

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:42.888
But eventually, when we saw
Mack begin to grab that rope,

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:43.589
we knew

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:45.391
he was thinking about ringing
that bell.

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:47.560
That's the face of somebody
that's about to ring this bell soon.

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:49.562
There's no way it's been under 24 hours.

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:52.531
God, I'm nervous.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.800
I've been in one of these videos
before.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.035
And I lost everything.

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:58.337
And the only reason
I even am back here at all

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.407
and got a second chance
is actually because of you guys.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.610
Me screwing up that second chance
all comes down to

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.847
if I know for a fact it's been 24 hours.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.083
I really hope I'm not making
a mistake right now.

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:11.951
Mack.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.787
Buddy, pal, how you doing?

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:17.523
Jimmy, I'm pretty nervous.

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:21.193
I don't want to accidentally
reveal the time, so no comment.

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:23.229
Jimmy, I don't know how you do this
for seven days, dude.

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:24.830
I do not feel well in here.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.464
Yeah.

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:26.699
Have you got to the point
where you start

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.133
to lose blood flow in your legs

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:31.370
and you feel like your back
is going to fall out of your body?

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:34.006
Jimmy, I'm thinking
about pulling this thing.

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:34.874
No comment.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.576
Jimmy, I'll give you 50 bucks back
if you tell me what time it is.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.410
No comment.

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:40.346
All right, I got a comment for you.

00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:41.947
Just get a shovel ready, all right?

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:43.148
Three.

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:44.617
Oh, my gosh,
he's about to do it.

00:14:45.117 --> 00:14:46.118
Two...

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:47.620
This is it.

00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:49.622
One.

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:51.891
Stop the timer.

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:54.727
And now that Mack has made his decision.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.029
There was just one
last thing I had to do.

00:14:57.529 --> 00:15:00.332
Do you mind if I tell them about
Shopify while we unbury you?

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:01.500
You have got to be kidding.

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:03.669
Shopify is a platform
that helps entrepreneurs

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.070
get started down the path they want.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.239
Sometimes starting
a business can be scary,

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:09.608
like getting covered in spiders
or being buried alive.

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:11.543
I can tell you,
you do not want to be buried alive.

00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:12.778
But Shopify is here to help.

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:14.847
If I hadn't started my own business,
I wouldn't have been able

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:17.016
to go to all the crazy places
like Antarctica

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:18.717
and make videos
like these for you guys.

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:21.287
And just like billions of other
people have done with Shopify.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.256
You can get started today
on your business right now.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.058
Mack, you want to know
how long you were in there?

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:28.060
I have a feeling you're not going
to tell me until you dig me up.

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:29.194
You are correct.

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:31.363
And one of the perks of owning
my own business is

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:34.033
I can do fun things like send
one of my friends to the Superbowl.

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:37.303
Mack, Karl and Nolan
each have their very own football for sale,

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:39.271
and whoever's football
sells the most.

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:41.106
I'm going to give you tickets
to the Super Bowl

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:43.142
and I'm going to bury the other one
alive.

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:45.044
All that matters is that you
download the Shop app

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:48.147
and vote from one of them by buying
either Nolan's or Karl's football.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:53.285
And now that I can afford this
video, let's see if Mack loses $700,000.

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:54.353
- Hi!
- Hi!

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.621
Hey, Jimmy.

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:57.189
There you go!

00:15:57.222 --> 00:15:58.590
Welcome to the outside world.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.327
Now that you are out of the coffin,
let's see if you were in there

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:02.361
for 24 hours.

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:06.699
If the number I reveal is lower
than 24 hours, then you lose $700,000.

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:08.901
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:10.002
Three...

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:11.303
Two...

00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:12.938
One...

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.941
36 hours!

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:19.578
That is what I am talking about.

00:16:21.947 --> 00:16:22.848
He scares me.

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.149
Congratulations, Mack.

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:26.885
This means that you are now
just one challenge away

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.220
from winning all this money.

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:28.921
Let's go.

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:30.289
You should probably go shower first.

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:32.191
Yeah, I smell not great.

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:34.226
So far in this video,
Mack has shown me

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:36.161
It is very difficult to scare him,

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:39.999
but the final challenge of this video
may just be Mack's worst fear ever.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.435
And that's because
the final challenge of this video

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:47.639
is a 1 to 1 recreation of the
challenge he failed on last time.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:48.941
The last challenge.

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:50.376
Hold this in front of your face.
Don't look.

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:51.243
- Hey, I'm not looking.
- Don't look.

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:53.045
- I'm not looking.
- All right, keep your eyes closed.

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:54.680
Don't open them.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.848
Don't open your eyes.

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.616
Keep walking. Don't open them.

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:58.517
Don't open them.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.819
All right, open them.

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:05.124
No, no, no.
I'm not doing that again.

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:05.824
Come over here.

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.961
No! Jimmy, I do not want to do this again.

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.096
Stand here where the cameras
can see you.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.297
- No!
- Okay.

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:15.034
The last challenge
is the fear of failure.

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:20.372
We recreated the set where
he lost $800,000 in this video

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:23.042
And like last time,
the rules are extremely simple.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.309
There are four stages.

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:26.311
Each has its own cookie with a shape on it.

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:29.114
You have to cut out all the shapes
without breaking a cookie.

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:32.684
And if you do break a cookie,
you lose $700,000.

00:17:32.684 --> 00:17:34.053
And for you specifically,

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.088
it will have been the second time
it's happened.

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:38.090
This is from my nightmares, man.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.358
I do not want to be here again.

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:41.093
Well, good.
Because I have an offer for you.

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:42.661
You can quit right now

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:46.498
and walk away with this 300 grand
or risk it for the biscuit.

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:50.202
And if you finish this final
challenge, win $700,000.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.339
This is actually like a
very, very big decision.

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.943
Yeah, because that's not quite
enough, is it? It's less than half.

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:03.348
But if you lose again, that is $1.5
million lost on this set.

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:05.784
Are you sure?

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.186
He's hitting it.

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:08.787
Mac, I know this is hard,

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:10.856
but you're going to have
to make a decision here.

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:13.459
Do you want to go home with $300,000

00:18:13.659 --> 00:18:16.428
or do you want to risk it all
for this final challenge?

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.198
All right, fine.
I'm doing it.

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:21.667
All right. To be honest, I'm glad.
I want you to win this whole thing.

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.168
If you look at this iPad right here,

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:27.272
this is exactly how long it took Mack
to get through all four stages

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:30.509
last time he did the challenge,
34 minutes and 54 seconds.

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:33.512
So that's exactly how long
I'm going to give you again.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.582
Starting now.

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.119
Don't break the cookie while opening.

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:41.987
There you go.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.358
Even though
he's going quick right now,

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:47.593
might not be in his best interest

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:49.928
because if he accidentally snaps a cookie,
he loses.

00:18:50.729 --> 00:18:51.897
34 minutes.

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:56.768
You did it that quick?

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:00.772
Scan, scan, scan, scan.

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:03.509
It's green.

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.578
This is a much different deal
than last time.

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:09.148
So I'm going to take my sweet time
cutting the circle out.

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:10.315
Let's go.

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:13.452
He is flying through this.

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:18.123
Why is it so much harder to open?

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:19.791
Probably because you're like
freaking out.

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:21.793
You want me to try?

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:22.361
Open it.

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:23.462
Okay. Hold my iPad.

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:28.800
Okay. It's very hard to open.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:29.701
What are you guys doing?

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:31.336
I don't want to be responsible for that.

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:35.040
Be careful.

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:38.076
Theoretically, Mack's strategy makes sense.

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:39.645
Getting through
the easier shapes fast

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:42.848
to save all the time for umbrella,
which he lost $800,000 off.

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.983
You literally still have 32 minutes left.

00:19:44.983 --> 00:19:46.952
Yeah. Well, I'm going to need
all 32 of those for umbrella.

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:48.353
That is borderline impossible.

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.456
- Move out.
- I'm moving.

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:53.492
Open it.

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:55.227
Allow me.

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:59.031
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.
Let's go.

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:06.305
Mack, stop breaking my set.

00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:08.240
Bro, you guys got to make
these easier to open.

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:12.244
There's just no need to rush.
You're literally using no time.

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:15.380
I mean, you might need to go slower
on this one because it's a lot trickier.

00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:18.784
This one is pretty hard,
not even close umbrella.

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:21.053
Trying to get to the race
before I start racing.

00:20:23.655 --> 00:20:24.923
God, this is so hard.

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:37.102
Oh my gosh.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.342
Well, I don't need that anymore.

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:52.985
Maybe it didn't break all the way through?

00:20:54.152 --> 00:20:54.920
Okay.

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:57.489
He still had 29 minutes left.

00:20:57.489 --> 00:20:59.791
He did the first two in 4 minutes

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.161
I don't know why I did this.

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:05.430
Oh, my God.

00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:06.932
I did that twice?

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:08.333
Here.

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:09.401
Give me your hand.

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:11.770
No. Jimmy, please.
I don't want to leave yet.

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:13.372
No, Jimmy.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:16.441
Nah, dude. I don't even know
how to feel right now.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.678
Right here.
Come on.

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.515
I have, like, so much time.

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:27.552
Yeah. I'm still just not sure
why you were going so fast.

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:30.522
The umbrella, I just know
that umbrella takes forever.

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:31.723
Yeah.

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:34.493
Okay.

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:37.729
Mack told me in this video
that there was nothing

00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:39.231
that I could do to scare him.

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:42.467
And after putting him through
spiders, a sinking car,

00:21:42.501 --> 00:21:44.870
and more,
I really did start to believe him.

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:46.271
Godspeed.

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:48.307
The only thing that ended up
getting to Mack...

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:51.877
was the fear of his own failure.

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:53.679
Godspeed.
