00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.490
(upbeat music)

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.240
(logo whirring)

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.890
- All right, y'all have
waited patiently for this.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.000
Once again, this year,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.240
we've run our blind
smartphone camera test,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.260
scientific style.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.640
We always think we know

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.740
what the absolute best
smartphone cameras are,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.810
but do we actually know?

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.940
Like what if we wanted an objective answer

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.620
straight from real-world data?

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.880
Literally every time I review a phone,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.687
there's some people in the
comments section saying,

00:00:22.687 --> 00:00:25.290
"Oh, iPhone photos are
the only good ones,"

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.090
or, "I only like Pixel photos,"

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.940
or, "Samsung is the only one
who does good portrait mode."

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.710
But what if we put that to the test?

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.580
What if we took a bunch

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.470
of the best smartphone
cameras on the planet

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.000
and took them out into the real world

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.680
and took the exact same photo

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.420
with each and every one of them,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.430
and then strip them of all their labels,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.290
and then had you, the public,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.380
vote on which one's
photos you like the best?

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.220
That should reveal the best
actual smartphone camera.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.360
So that's exactly what we did.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.900
This year, we took these 20 smartphones,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.280
updated all of their software,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.180
charged 'em all up,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.740
got their batteries to 100%.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.290
Then we went out and took
the same three photos

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.280
with each one.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.840
One daytime photo,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.220
one low-light photo,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.680
and one portrait-mode photo.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.480
Yes, it is surprisingly
hard to stay perfectly still

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.820
for 20 identical photos
to be taken in a row,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.870
but I did it for you.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.550
Then we had to go in and
import all the photos

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.840
from every single smartphone camera,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.950
harder than you think,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.570
strip them of all their EXIF data,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.880
and then upload them to
a site that we've built

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.740
that lets us put them side by side

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.020
for you guys to vote on head-to-head

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.810
millions and millions
and millions of times,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.040
which you did.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.873
That should give us

00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:32.610
a statistically significant winner,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.110
and loser, we'll get to that.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.580
And the results this year

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.250
were kind of interesting, a little bit.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.480
I almost didn't make this video,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.160
but I can tell people have been waiting,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.020
the competitive tension is high,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.790
and the actual results

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.140
might be a little
surprising to some of you.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.850
So let's get into it.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.320
So the data our site spits out

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.940
all comes in these text files

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.080
with matchup ratings

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.900
for every single
combination of smartphones.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.160
We actually had them coded

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.900
by letters of the alphabet you can see,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.220
A through T.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.270
But that little number,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.670
that one right here is the most important.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.680
That is the Elo rating.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.710
You know, the system
that ranks chess players,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.780
or tennis players, basically
anything head-to-head.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.640
With enough matchup information,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.520
we can sort of sort through
all of these letters

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.930
based on who they beat

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.890
and who they lose to,

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.900
and create a power rankings,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.940
and that will give us our winners.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.370
So the question you
probably all wanna know,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.020
who were the winners?

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.390
And so we'll go category by category

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.610
because, like I said, there
were three different scenarios,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.010
daytime, low light and portrait mode,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.090
so let's go one by one.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.580
So daytime, for the
regular daylight photos,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.450
we kinda had it set up

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.310
with just me sitting in
front of this window here,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.660
but there's a lot to this photo.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.670
The strongest light is
from inside the room,

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.840
but then the window light

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.330
is actually a good test of dynamic range.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.040
And then there's also a variety of colors,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.270
there's my skin tone,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.940
there's the orange chair
next to the blue pillow,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.990
a few other things.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.823
This is on purpose,

00:02:52.823 --> 00:02:54.180
there's no individual variable

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.890
that can dominate this test.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.480
So every single phone,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.060
we try to frame the exact same way,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.410
from the exact same spot,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.850
holding one of 'em up as a reference

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.650
so we can get as close as possible.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.000
And everything is fully auto,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.590
we just open the camera app,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.670
make sure the lens is clean

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.840
and just hit the shutter button.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.010
We don't even tap to focus,

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.410
just point and shoot.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.830
It takes about six minutes
to go through all 20 phones.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.300
Like I said, it's kinda hard to sit still

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.040
for six minutes straight, but we did it.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.870
So for this regular
daylight photo situation,

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.833
the winner with the highest
Elo rating is the Pixel 7A.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.430
That's pretty impressive.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.040
So this is the photo that
you guys, for the most part,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.070
voted as the winner in
most of its matchups.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.630
Pretty neutral photo, to be honest,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.730
not too bright, not too dark,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.070
pretty excellent dynamic range.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.210
And it's also not a fluke

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.890
because the second-highest Elo rating

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.660
came from the Pixel Fold.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.670
So the Fold took a very similar photo.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.710
And then finishing up on the podium

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.750
was the OnePlus Open,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.180
one of those high-end folding phones.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.490
So I will say, my personal favorite photo

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.350
and the one that actually won for me

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.120
when I blind tested myself

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.260
was this one.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.690
This is the fourth-highest Elo rating,

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.040
this is the OnePlus 11.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.720
It's definitely a little
on the contrastier side,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.770
but a little more confident

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.760
with nailing the exposure

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.200
and having dynamic range.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.270
Nevertheless, it's
definitely interesting here.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.780
A lot of people pointed
out that the sun behind me

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.000
looked a little different in each photo.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.120
It might've been setting,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.950
so the background was a little different,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.150
which is a little bit true,

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.530
but it wasn't late enough in the day

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.020
for that to actually affect the photo.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.280
I think the fact that the 7A

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.500
is the only one with
this little lens flare

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.690
is actually just a coincidence.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.730
And then fun fact, in dead last

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.970
with the absolute bottom-lowest Elo rating

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.090
for this daytime photo

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.023
is the iPhone 15 Pro.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.120
Not a terrible photo.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.860
I mean, you can't really
get a horrible photo

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.150
in normal-looking lighting

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.290
for most of these smartphones,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.660
but when you put it up against the others,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.550
it's mostly just the darkest one.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.870
And so when you put it up side-by-side

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.160
against these much brighter photos,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.750
people just picked the brighter one

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.550
almost every single time.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.390
Funnily enough, though,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.810
you can absolutely overexpose
for this competition,

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.030
as the second-lowest Elo rating

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.220
belongs to the Galaxy S23 Ultra

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.970
for producing this weirdly
overexposed masterpiece.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.190
So here are all the photos side-by-side

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.270
with their Elo ratings.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.110
Feel free to pause it

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.390
if you'd like to make
some more observations,

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.150
but let's move on to the nighttime photos.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.480
So low light, low light is
a much more challenging shot

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.650
for a smartphone camera,

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.960
especially with a tiny
sensor and tiny optics

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.060
trying to take in as
much light as possible.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.940
But computational photography
has come a long way,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.010
and even in this pretty dark rooftop

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.700
where the only light source
was like 40 feet away from me,

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.980
these cameras still
managed to do a good job.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.630
And if you're ready for the plot twist,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.730
the highest overall Elo rating

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.350
for the low-light photo

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.370
comes from, dead last
from the daylight photo,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.610
it is again the iPhone 15 Pro,

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.210
with another totally reasonable photo.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.490
Now, following it very
closely in second place

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.470
was the Pixel 8 Pro.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.890
And actually the Pixel 7A coming in third.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.410
And to be honest, I fully
agree with all of these.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.420
It's starting to get ridiculous

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.420
how much some of the
other smartphone cameras

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.980
started to pump up the light,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.830
like literally the second
you get outside the top four,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.740
you get straight into bad HDR territory.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.100
Like this is the fifth-place
photo from S23 Ultra,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.570
which is definitely too bright.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.630
And also, you can see this
little HDR halo-y effect

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.340
starting to show up around my head.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.590
And then if you scroll all the way down

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.290
to the Oppo Find X6 Pro,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.810
just, my God, what happened?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.640
Like these cameras are going nuts.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.720
It looks like in this one

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.910
they literally painted sloppily over me

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.160
and just dragged up the exposure.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.993
Matter of fact.

00:06:41.993 --> 00:06:44.250
(pencil scratching)

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.083
Yep, see?

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:46.710
That's exactly what it looks like.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.000
The Zenfone did this, too,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.410
along with a few others.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.600
And I honestly think the OnePlus Open

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.760
not only made me brighter,

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.830
but then it also identified the sky

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.840
and made the sky darker,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.240
which just then starts to look ridiculous.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.940
I mean, real life looked
nothing like this.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.280
So here are all the nighttime photos,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.660
and their Elo ratings.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.070
Pause it if you need it.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.650
And now we can move to the
last-but-not-least category,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.483
portrait mode.

00:07:11.483 --> 00:07:13.860
So portrait mode kind of turns
out to be the hardest test,

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.790
like this to run

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.230
because they all kinda do portrait mode

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.220
a little bit differently.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.840
If you just open the camera app

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.920
and switch to portrait mode,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.967
some of 'em do 2X,

00:07:20.967 --> 00:07:22.133
some of 'em are 3X,

00:07:22.133 --> 00:07:23.760
some of 'em say 1X,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.470
but they're actually like 1.5X,

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.303
it's kinda weird.

00:07:26.303 --> 00:07:27.900
So we tried to just keep
it simple for this test

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.190
and just open the camera app,

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.150
switch to portrait mode,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.040
and then move our feet forward or backward

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.840
to try to match the focal length

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.610
with all of these shots.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.443
It kinda worked,

00:07:36.443 --> 00:07:39.240
and they all kinda also
have different bokeh levels,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.200
some of 'em are adjustable,

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.100
some of 'em aren't.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.140
But like I said, we're just
going with the default,

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.880
the point and shoot that
most people will get

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.080
when they do it.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.510
And the portrait-mode,
point-and-shoot winner

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.520
with the highest Elo rating

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.500
is the Pixel 8 Pro.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.430
This was followed pretty
closely by Samsung Z Fold 5,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.470
which I actually think
had a better cutout.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.780
And then the third-highest Elo here

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.190
was the iPhone 15 Pro,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.530
which I think had the
most natural-looking blur.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.300
But basically all of
these podium finishers

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.610
have relatively subtle portrait modes,

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.410
nothing too dramatic,

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.780
and then pretty good
detail and overall balance

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.010
in just the rest of the photo.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.470
I say this because the losers here

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.480
in this particular category

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.787
were nothing like this.

00:08:19.787 --> 00:08:23.070
(laughing) They were some of
the wonkiest, weirdest photos

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.940
in the entire competition.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.000
And the loser with the
absolute lowest Elo rating

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.930
for this category,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.820
and actually in any category,

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.360
was the Sony Xperia 1 V

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.673
with this photo,

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.900
with that, that's the photo?

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.090
Like, okay, this one looks like a mistake.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.120
We all actually thought it
was a mistake as we shot it,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.040
like, "This can't
possibly be right, right?"

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.290
We clean the lens, we take it again,

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:50.790
it does it again.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.530
And then it did it again and again.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.560
So I mean, I guess, for whatever reason,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.200
this $1,200 Android flagship phone

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.300
in its auto portrait mode

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.700
just could not handle this lighting,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.680
it had some weird issues.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.050
Anyway, here's all of
the portrait-mode photos

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.700
and their Elo ratings.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.533
You're welcome.

00:09:09.533 --> 00:09:11.160
I'd like to give out some awards.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.960
Now that we have all of our matchup data

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.330
and all of our voting and
all of our Elo ratings

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.890
from across every single person

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.540
for what you guys voted for

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.270
for more than 20 million total votes,

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.890
there's some pretty
interesting stuff here.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.090
So we have our winners and losers

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.010
in each of the three
categories, which is cool,

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.980
but if you average it all together,

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.430
we have the highest
overall average Elo rating.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.620
We'll call this one the People's Champ.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.680
And with the highest average of 1,660,

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.243
that's pretty competitive.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.060
It was the Pixel 7A.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.100
So this one won the daytime photo,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.970
as you probably remember,

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.180
but then it also came in third
place in the nighttime photo

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.780
and fourth place of all 20
in the portrait-mode photo.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.940
So that's pretty strong.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.800
But here's the kicker,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.060
the second-highest average Elo rating

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.500
was the Pixel 8 Pro,

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.810
and the third-highest average Elo rating,

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.433
again, this is your votes,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.400
is the Pixel Fold.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.200
So Pixel, Pixel, Pixel,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.480
it's a perfect Pixel podium.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.250
So here you can see the whole list

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.210
from top to bottom.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.530
The three Pixels at the top,

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.610
surprisingly in reverse price order.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.270
(laughing) And then bringing
up the rear for total Elo

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.790
is the Sony Xperia 1 V

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.260
and the Xiaomi 13 Ultra.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.540
Then I also had to bring back
the Bang for the Buck Award,

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.130
which I did this last year also,

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.430
it's basically just
most votes from you guys

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.280
divided by MSRP at launch.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.620
So most votes per dollar, basically.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.700
And so your winner, again,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.230
is going to be the Pixel 7A.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.690
This was a phone that launched
right around 500 bucks.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.130
It did incredible on the tests.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.190
But in second place in votes per dollar

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.320
is the Nothing Phone 2.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.150
So a pretty good-performing phone,

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.130
and it actually launched
like upper mid-range price.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.830
So this is a good phone
bang for the buck-wise.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.110
And then in 3A, 3B,

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.700
right next to each other
underneath these two,

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.640
you have the OnePlus
11 and the Zenfone 10.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.050
And then impressively, actually the Sony

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.640
is not dead last in this category,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.860
it is expensive and it
did perform horribly,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.290
but not worse bang for the buck-wise

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.240
than a super-expensive folding phone,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.300
the Z Flip5 overall average

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.210
did worse for the dollar,
the more you know.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.950
So what did we learn with all this?

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.330
Well, I'll leave you with this.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.340
First of all, the Pixels killed it,

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.690
they had the one-two-three finish,

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.830
they're great bang for the buck.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.530
It was weird that they're
inverse price order, but fine.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.590
But also there's a lot more
to a smartphone camera,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.010
of course, than just a
sitting-down, staged photo

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:35.910
of a person.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.210
We learned a little bit about
how it shoots my skin tones.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.190
There's a whole bunch of other
things you might care about,

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.143
from auto-focus speed, to the UI,

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.830
to the actual file format,
how editable it is,

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.220
to videos, like there's
a bunch more to it.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.870
But at the end of the day,

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.350
I think we were still pretty not shocked

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.210
by the slightly brighter photos

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.760
beating the slightly less bright photos.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.050
And maybe we'll run it
back again next year

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.610
and learn something new.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.310
Either way, thanks for watching this one.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.143
Catch you guys next time.

00:12:06.143 --> 00:12:07.456
Peace.

00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:10.039
(upbeat music)
