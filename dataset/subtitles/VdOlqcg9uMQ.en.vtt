00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:01.792
(cube bounces)

00:00:01.792 --> 00:00:03.180
(electronic crackling)

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.290
- Budget phones are fun,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.850
because, pretty much with all of them,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.350
if you poke around hard enough,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.020
you will find the thing that
they had to cut corners on,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.820
you'll find the thing
that they trimmed back

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.920
to get it to be a budget phone.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.690
And so for picking one for
you, it's just a matter

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.790
of picking the one that
makes the trade offs

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.720
that you're okay with.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.800
Like maybe you love,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.230
you gotta have good build
quality and cameras.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.450
Well then, iPhone SE is
probably a good one for you.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.490
And then you know you're
not gonna get a great screen

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.140
or battery life or things like that.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.170
Or maybe you gotta have
a great big screen.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.150
Samsung makes the Galaxy A54.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.060
Ar maybe you gotta have
good software and cameras.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.740
Pixel 7A.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.850
This phone is 350 bucks.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.479
And this, this is the designer one.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.729
(sophisticated electro-jazz music)

00:00:55.386 --> 00:00:58.320
(electronic crackling)

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.080
So, this phone is not
going to win anyone over

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.430
with raw specs.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.160
It's not gonna win by
having the best camera

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.890
or the best battery life
of any budget phone.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.780
The performance isn't gonna
blow you outta the water,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.670
but you could definitely argue

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.100
that it's the prettiest $350 phone.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.200
So Nothing has had this
transparent aesthetic going

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.250
for a while with their phones,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.480
and then also the earbuds.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.490
This one definitely also has that.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.620
There's also a white version of this.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.590
I think it looks better, it
also has like black buttons,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.000
so it's kinda this nice contrast,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.980
but, you know, dark
version looks cool too.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.190
And honestly if the mission is
to look like a Nothing phone,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.630
and not be mistaken for anything else,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.700
then, yeah, mission
definitely accomplished.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.920
The dual cameras in the
middle and near the top

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.180
is pretty unique.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.830
Kinda like a pair of eyes maybe.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.590
And the NFC coil actually
surrounds the cameras.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.950
Then there are three bars of
LEDs making a glyph design

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.630
around the camera circle again.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.700
Then it's kinda this split design,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.490
the bottom half is like
a PCB-inspired look,

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.070
apparently inspired by the
New York City subway map.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.300
And Nothing's already shown people this,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.250
like there's been some
reactions to the design already.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.650
Some people love it, some
people actually hate it.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.000
I don't know, it's a bit asymmetrical,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.520
so it's unconventional for
sure, but I think it's nice,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.390
not gonna lie.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.490
But even if you don't like
it, at least you can say

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.160
it's at least somewhat
visually interesting.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.070
You know, there's some textures,
there's some exposed screws

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.260
and some text and that little red square,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.720
it's not functional, it's
just purely to look cool,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.250
so, I appreciate that.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.450
And if you do like this look

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.010
but have maybe a more boring phone

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.660
that you're not willing to give up,

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.890
then channel sponsor dbrand

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.050
has you covered with
their Something skins.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.280
So if you haven't heard of it already,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.080
dbrand has performed some,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.467
and these are their words, not mine,

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:36.150
"Creative plagiarism" on
Nothing's whole design language,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.190
both in light mode and dark mode,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.590
so I'll leave a link below
if you wanna check those out.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.520
But guess what?

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.530
It's an extremely
competitive price bracket,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.910
so you get a good looking phone,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.640
but you still will have to
make some sacrifices to get it.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.900
So first of all, it's clear
plastic, not glass, at the back.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.733
Which, you know,

00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:54.660
I'm sure Zach will get to
this phone at some point,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.750
but I think it'll be easier
to scuff and scratch,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.510
but harder to shatter,
like glass would be,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.460
so, but I think it's a
reasonable trade off.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.490
It's also a textured
plastic frame as well,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.630
so it looks like aluminum,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.060
but it's this plastic all
the way around the phone,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.430
to the point where this phone
actually ends up feeling

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.500
surprisingly light in the
hand for how big it is.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.970
But we should just get to that,

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.320
this is a huge, it's a
jumbo-sized phone, it's gigantic.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.790
Some people might not love that,

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.010
but I think a lotta people
like really big screens,

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.270
and you get the natural advantages

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.290
that come with a big phone,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.660
which is a big battery and a big screen.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.930
So this is a relatively
giant 6.7-inch display

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.130
corner to corner.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.290
It's literally ultra phone size.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.520
And it gets pretty bright too,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.380
so definitely not flagship bright,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.090
'cause we have some
crazy numbers these days,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.160
but 1300 knits peak brightness

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.500
is very visible in bright indoor lighting,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.150
and bezels are even

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.590
all the way around the front of the phone,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.350
so, aesthetically, I have no complaints.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.660
And then even at this price, it's AMOLED,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.240
it has an optical fingerprint
reader under the glass.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.060
Its variable refresh rate up to 120 hertz.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.030
And it even has 2160 hertz PWM dimming.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.950
So if you don't like
the back of this phone,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.030
at least the front of it,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.800
that you're actually
looking at all the time,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.630
is pretty impressive for 350 bucks.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.250
But I'd say an even bigger
strength to this phone

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.780
is battery life.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.690
So battery always comes from
three main things, basically,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.660
obviously having a huge physical battery.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.810
Also good software and an efficient chip.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.070
We'll get to the software.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.590
But, this phone has a
5000-milliamp hour battery,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.700
that's literally bigger

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.040
than their flagship phones from Nothing,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.840
so, really big battery.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.520
It doesn't have wireless charging,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.060
but it does have 45-watt wire charging.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.880
Which is pretty good, that's
zero to full in an hour.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.520
And the chip it's running
is this little thing

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.410
called the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.870
So, this was my biggest
question mark, actually,

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.370
going into testing this phone,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.270
'cause, you know how Nothing

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.460
teases the specs and stuff ahead of time.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.590
So we find out it's a MediaTek chip,

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.720
and I'm not sure if this
one's going to perform

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.340
the way I've been used
to some other phones,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.200
like they're showcasing
all these, you know,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.480
specifically handpicked
benchmarks results,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.420
of course they will, but
conveniently, they only compare it

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.280
to a two-year-old Nothing Phone 1

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.520
which had that mid-range,
778G Plus from Qualcomm.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.420
Now, I'm not expecting
flagship stuff for 350 bucks,

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.850
but like, what's it gonna land at,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.100
this feels like a make or
break part of the phone.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.780
And I've been pleasantly surprised.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.780
Now, it's not gonna win
any prizes with raw specs,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.210
and I definitely don't think
it'll earn anybody's money

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.070
with the benchmark scores alone,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.000
you look at those numbers,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.850
you're like "Okay, not
a total shock here."

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.480
But as far as actual performance,
when you use the phone,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.310
the way I'd put it is, it's respectable,

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.250
and I really feel like that is
a testament to the software,

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.420
and how well it's working together.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.720
So, at this point we're on Nothing OS 2.5,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.460
on top of Android 14.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.520
And you already have seen
Nothing Phone software

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.590
with the dots and the
aesthetic and all that stuff,

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.310
but, it's clean, there's no bloat wear,

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.510
and there is a solid
focus on fast and smooth,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.520
it kinda feels like a throwback

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.250
to the old OnePlus Magic back in the day.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.310
But with regular use, this phone
is quite smooth and snappy.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.590
Sometimes a fingerprint
reader shudders a little bit,

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.790
like when you're first unlocking,

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.840
but for the most part,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.420
if you're just using the phone
doing stuff like messaging

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.840
or flipping through a couple
apps, email, web browsing,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.900
taking your pictures,
this is a smooth phone.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.310
It's pretty similar to what they did

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.193
with the Nothing Phone 1, with this 778.

00:06:24.368 --> 00:06:25.440
It's very solid with everyday use,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.050
and the second you try to
do super high-end stuff,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.520
like gaming,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.770
then you'll see where the
benchmarks come up short,

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.630
where you start dropping
frames and all that.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.140
But, again, this is a $350 phone

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.180
and I am definitely not
complaining about that.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.800
Now Nothing has had some time now

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.160
to build up their aesthetic
and their identity

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.040
and what they really want
a Nothing phone to be.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.960
And I gotta say, they
have a lot of unique,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.000
really identifiable things going on here

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.550
that you may like or dislike,
but they're all here.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.010
So aesthetically they've
got the dots everywhere.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.590
So the stock apps have
this dots aesthetic,

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.450
and the thin font to go with it.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.810
The back arrow in Android
is made of these dots.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.970
And they have this extensive
built-out selection

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.350
of Nothing widgets now,

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.300
most of them with the dots theme as well,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.760
so you can have this very
consistent home screen aesthetic.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.960
And then there's other little stuff,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.780
like you can enlarge a single app icon

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.970
to fill up four spots on your home screen

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.800
for a unique home screen grid.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.240
I don't know, you might be into that.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.580
There's also this nice little animation

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.380
with the folders on the home screen.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.660
Also this new thing which
lets you add a glass effect

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.650
to your wallpaper,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.660
so it's blurred behind your home screen

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.180
for better visibility, I
actually really like that.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.010
There's also AI wallpapers now,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.710
so you can jump into the wallpaper studio

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.130
and create the most soulless combo art

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.280
the world has ever seen
in just a few taps.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.430
There's also third-party icon pack support

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.070
on the home screen, with
instant one-touch previews.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.650
And then of course the glyphs.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.560
So, this phone still has
some lights on the back,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.840
it's less lights that the
flagship, than the phone two,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.940
but, about the same
amount of functionality.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.980
So there's one vertical
light on the right,

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.750
and a small one down
here on the bottom left,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.720
and then the big top one
arcing around the top left.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.810
This is the one that works
with the glyph countdown timer.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.160
Maybe you'll find that useful.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.830
The blinking notification
glyph when your phone is down,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.440
I still wish I could just
customize it a little bit more,

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.230
I know they don't wanna do
RGB, but if this was RGB,

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.090
I would totally have different colors

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.770
light up for different app notifications

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.990
and I would go to town
with that, but, you know,

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.550
it still works with just white lights.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.270
And it also does music visualizations

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.180
to sync up with any music
coming out of the speaker,

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.477
so...

00:08:34.477 --> 00:08:38.430
(phone plays electro-R&amp;B music)

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:39.263
I don't know.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.218
Sure.

00:08:42.218 --> 00:08:43.290
Obviously some of this stuff is gimmicks.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.260
Some of this you may find
useful like once or twice,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.390
I almost never use the countdown clock,

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.610
but the one time I use
it, it's kinda cool.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.500
Side note, I couldn't
get the glyph composer

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.060
to work at all on this phone.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:54.893
The UI worked,

00:08:54.893 --> 00:08:57.030
but it didn't light up
the lights on the back.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.460
But you know, on super closeup photos,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.850
maybe the glyph fill flash
is decently useful sometimes,

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.440
useless other times.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.840
But hey, while we're on
the subject, the camera.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.930
The cameras on the back
here are serviceable,

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.280
like, it's just practical

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.870
to have cameras on the back of your phone,

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.900
and these, they're not
good, but, they're fine.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.030
I always feel like we go
into budget phone reviews

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.050
kinda knowing, okay,

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.480
this isn't gonna have
cameras that blow me away,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.370
it's not gonna be as
interesting to test these,

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.890
but, you gotta test 'em anyway
and see what they're made of,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.300
so, this has a different

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.430
new 50-megapixel primary
camera on the back,

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.710
and then it has the same ultra-wide camera

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.700
as the Nothing phone too,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.560
and actually also the same selfie camera.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.500
And look, it can take okay pictures.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.240
Alright, passable pictures.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.890
I know 50 megapixels is a big number,

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.940
but, here's what I'll say:

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.010
at this level, even in great lighting,

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.200
the photos aren't particularly sharp.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.590
The dynamic range or depth
of field aren't amazing.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.240
Like, you're not buying this phone

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.030
to take the greatest most
artistic photos and videos

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.080
the world has ever seen.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.200
But, what you do need is
for it to be serviceable,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.570
to be quick enough for autofocus to work,

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.500
for it to capture a moment,
document scanning, video calls,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.150
sharing photos with people.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.640
And it does all that,
and it's totally fine,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.570
and I can't complain.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.270
And really what's left a
bigger imprint on me using this

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.910
is that, compared to their
other flagship phones,

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.090
almost all of the features are still here.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.890
Like the only one I'm not actually seeing

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.410
on this budget version of
the phone is macro mode.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.110
And that, that theme of
keeping a lotta the stuff

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.370
from the more expensive phones

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.010
and not doing these artificial cuts,

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.160
that's what feels good about
this phone as a budget phone,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.130
to me, it actually feels like
they're trying to give people

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.060
all of the Nothing phone
experience for less money.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.010
Now, we definitely can't
say it's one-to-one,

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.080
there's obviously cuts,
especially with hardware,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.060
Like there's no wireless
charging, like I said.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.760
It's IP54 instead of IP68.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.580
It's plastic instead
of glass and aluminum.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.000
But, I like that once you
start to get to use the phone,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.360
especially with the software
features, experience wise,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.120
I don't feel nearly as many
artificial-feeling cuts

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.320
as we've seen on other phones.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.090
Like there's no pro mode in the camera

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.310
that's missing from the budget phone.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.550
All the same advanced settings,
the experimental features,

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.070
all the home screen
features with Nothing OS,

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.960
it's all here, on this cheaper phone.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.520
And the crazy part to me is,

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.220
they obviously wanna compare
this to a lower-end phone,

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.810
so they compare it to the Phone 1,

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.457
and my natural instinct is
like, "I'm ignoring that,

00:11:21.457 --> 00:11:23.730
"of course they're comparing
it to the old phone."

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.280
But when, you actually look
at that 2-year-old phone,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.560
you kinda see how far they've come.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.790
And you look at the things

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.950
that are actually better
about this budget phone.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.690
This Nothing Phone 2A has
a bigger, brighter screen,

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.100
with thinner bezels.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.340
It has a larger battery,
with faster charging,

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.380
a higher-processor clock speed,

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.600
a higher-resolution front camera,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.990
and a wider variety of refresh
rates than the Phone 1.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.970
Like, no wonder they
wanna show us the Phone 1.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.330
But, in general, if you're
looking for the TLDW,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.250
yes, this is a good, solid,
all-around budget phone.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.230
And the way Nothing has
been tracking with software,

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.940
it appears, I mean they're promising

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.100
three years of Android
updates with this phone.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.170
I think this will be a
good budget phone to own

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.240
for the next couple years.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.130
Well done, Nothing.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:11.963
Well done.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.160
Thanks for watching.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.660
Catch you guys in the next one.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.493
Base.
