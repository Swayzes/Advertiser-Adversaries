00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.303
This is the first of 100 wells
we're going to build in this video.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.006
Wow! Water!

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:09.442
Water!

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.244
- Oh.
- Oh, crap.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:14.080
You just witnessed a small village
in Kenya get access to

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.417
unlimited clean drinking
water in less than a second.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.420
One down, 99 more wells in Africa
to go.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:21.821
You're going to love this video.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:22.489
Combined,

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.923
these 100 wells are going

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:27.227
to give around half a million people
fresh water to drink.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.529
And after building some more wells
on the side of Kenya,

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.965
we flew south
to the school system of Nairiri.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:34.901
And let's just say
they were really happy to see us.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.003
How's it going?

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.906
I was not expecting this.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.710
Thank you for the welcome.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:45.045
¡Jimmy! ¡Jimmy!
¡Jimmy!

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.646
Not sure how to react.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.350
I appreciate it, everybody.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.986
This village threw
a welcome ceremony upon our arrival

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.188
and Nolan got really into it.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.090
Nolan's the most awkward person
I've ever met.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.691
And that's a lot coming from me.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.493
And after being shown
around the school. Yeah.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.961
Here comes our guest.

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:02.896
How's it going?

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.631
Are you having a good day?

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.865
It's nice meeting you all.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:06.766
Have a good day.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.701
One of the teachers showed me
where the students

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.404
currently get their water,
which is from this river,

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.239
that's extremely unsafe to drink.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.974
This is where your students
used to get water from?

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:15.809
Yes.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:16.676
This is crazy.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:17.177
Yeah.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:20.980
You know, students complaining of
diarrhea, infections like typhoid,

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:22.849
because this is the water
we've been using.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.617
So we tried to treat.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.586
But you see, look at it, you know.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.922
But at the end of the day,
life has to move on.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.790
You have to get some water anyway.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.027
This situation
is obviously extremely sad.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.029
These children's
lives are being limited

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.566
and sometimes cut short for
being forced to drink unsafe water.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.267
But at least for this village,

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.103
we're going to
put an end to it right now.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.106
I don't think this John's going to fit.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.508
I have a big head.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.643
Let's see if we can find some water.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.620
It's raining.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.388
It's beautiful.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.157
After the water
comes out of the ground,

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.359
it's fed into enormous barrels
like this one.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.528
And once they're built
into the water towers,

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.863
all of the neighboring villages

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.031
will not only have clean
drinking water,

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.001
but a pressurized water
source as well, which, in short,

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.104
means no more doing laundry
in unsafe water.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.172
And pull!

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.508
On a scale of one to Nolan's mom,
how heavy is it?

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.276
Nolan's mom times two.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:23.943
Oh, God.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:25.378
I'll push you off of this.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.715
All right, here
we go. Under control.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:32.018
We built 20 more wells in Kenya,
and after we were done,

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.320
Bro has another well in there.

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:35.889
Don't worry, I have more water
in my other shoe.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.324
Just so you know how we built these
first 29 wells...

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:41.861
We use this giant drill to dig
hundreds of feet into the ground,

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:43.229
past the polluted sources,

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.533
and into an enormous
aquifer of pure, drinkable water.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.835
After that,
we spend time installing pipes

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.670
so that people all around Africa

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:53.673
can access water from spigots
like this one in Nairiri.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:54.574
Let's see how it taste.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:57.977
Like water.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.680
It took me about a minute to fill
this five gallon drum.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.549
How much water can this provide
a day?

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.450
3600 gallons a day.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.951
Not only will

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.986
this well cover
the 400 kids at the school,

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.821
but literally
the entire neighborhood

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.990
and village around
this school can use this well.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.059
We say thank you for the water.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.227
No problem.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:16.996
This thing can basically
pump nonstop for 30 years.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.830
You would think that

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.599
having an effect of this magnitude

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.769
would require the resources
and funding of a large government.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.270
But that's not true.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.141
Solving this problem is possible
and it's something humanity should

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:30.009
all be putting effort in to fix.

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.178
What's the secret of success?

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:34.147
To be honest,
just find something you love doing

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:36.783
and do it for a long period
and eventually you'll succeed.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.452
So I'm going to bring it
super close. See us?

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.954
- Isn't that cool?
- Yes.

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:42.655
If you look up, it's recording.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.425
All right.
well, I'm going to get close.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:46.693
All right.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:48.995
Yeah, you can see yourself.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.497
We were also able to install a
well for this village.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:54.934
In this village
and these 12 other villages.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.536
And while we were finishing these wells,

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:57.870
we were also able to update

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.706
one of their schools
with brand new computers.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.708
- How are they liking it?
- They really like.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.543
- They like them.
- Glad to see it turned out well.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.778
And we also updated the classrooms
with new

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:08.514
furniture, installed shelves
and filled them with new books,

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:10.717
donated a soccer ball
for every student,

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.752
- Thank you, Mr Beast.
- Thank you for this!

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:15.188
and even put modern whiteboards
and projectors

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:16.556
in all of the classrooms.

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:17.991
Do you guys like the projector?

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:19.225
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.393
We were using a chalk

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:23.529
that made a lot of dust,
but today everything is clean.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:24.764
We truly appreciate it.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.532
No problem.
It's the least we could do.

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:27.600
But then when we flew out

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.770
to the site of the 45th well,
we realized this community

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.804
had it even harder.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.406
Every time they need to get water,

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:36.542
they need to take a treacherous,
mile long hike through the jungle.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:40.480
And that mile long hike also happens
to be on a giant mountain.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:45.551
I wake up very early about 4:00
so that I can fetch water for the school.

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.120
We are not safe fetching water here.

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:48.421
That place is very slippery.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.156
Chances of getting in
an injury is very high.

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:52.925
So while we worked on their well,
the community took me to see

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.427
how they currently source water.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:56.529
You guys would have to make
this trip how many times a day?

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.698
- Two times.
- Two times a day...

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.900
So a typical student would carry
something like this? Yeah.

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:02.201
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:05.071
If 200 students did this every day,
how hard could it be?

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.639
It could be very hard.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.141
Oh, oh boy.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.543
Dang, this is very steep.

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:13.146
We're just walking down
this mountain forever.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:13.780
Every day!

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:17.450
It was actually surprising
how difficult this hike was.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.319
And these people go through
all of that

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.120
just to get to this spigot.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.823
That water is still unsafe to drink.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.358
This is where you guys
get your water from normally.

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:25.792
Yes.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:26.859
And filled with water,

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:31.397
these jugs can weigh up to 40 pounds,
which is insane for these children

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:32.832
to be carrying up this mountain.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.534
The ladies can carry two of those.

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:37.070
Oh, I totally can as well then.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.274
And as soon as the jugs were filled, it
was time to head all the way back up.

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:42.842
Hurry up.
Let's go.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.177
He's not even sweating or anything.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.678
No, I got it.
I got it.

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:49.849
And now, instead of spending hours
a day for unsafe water,

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.019
their new well is only ten feet
away from the school.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.921
So they can just fill it up here now.

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:57.156
I'm too tired.

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:58.958
And so
we were on to the next village

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.462
where we built our 46th well,
but we ran into a little problem.

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:03.062
We found out

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:06.933
that this village is divided in half
by this huge, dangerous river.

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:10.269
It may not look like much now,
but when the rainy season comes,

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:14.040
the water comes up this high
and literally swallows this bridge.

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:17.043
And why this bridge is such a
big deal is the villages over there,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.245
the hospital
and schools are over there.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.247
So they're crossing this bridge
multiple times a day.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.584
Despite how dangerous this bridge
is, it's their only option.

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:25.852
This river, when it is swollen,

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:28.921
it can sweep away people,
students or even animals.

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:30.990
In the recent past,
we have lost about three people

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.291
trying to cross this river.

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:36.028
This loss of life is insane
and absolutely unacceptable.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.731
The moment we heard about this,
we knew we had to help.

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:40.900
So while we started work
on a new bridge

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.437
that would let them reach there,
well, we then traveled over 2000

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:47.073
miles from Kenya
to the country of Zimbabwe.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.375
We've been in Africa
for over a week,

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.210
and we still have a lot more wells
to do.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.412
- You kind of smell.
- I know. It's weird.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.079
I showered this morning.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.948
If you let me finish,
I can put my arms down.

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:58.084
Can I count on you two
to finish these wells with me?

00:06:58.117 --> 00:06:58.885
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:01.654
First on the agenda
was to check out a local hospital

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:03.723
that was in dire
need of clean water.

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:04.624
Upon entering,

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:08.127
we learned how big of an impact
this clinic had on the village.

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:10.062
How many kids do you guys
give birth to a year here?

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:10.997
In a month...

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.964
about 50.

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:14.333
- So 600 births a year?
- Yes.

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:17.537
But unfortunately,
the pregnant mothers at this clinic

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:20.273
have to walk over a mile
just to get water

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:23.042
and then carry these heavy buckets
all the way back.

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:26.145
However, the good news is
we paid for the construction

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:27.547
of a new modern well for them.

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:32.885
All that needed to be done now
was to turn it on.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.154
All right, Nolan, are you ready?

00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:36.522
I'm ready. Over.

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:38.758
Let me get a dramatic zoom in.

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:40.626
Nolan, I pressed the button.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:41.527
Is it working?

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:44.230
It's flowing.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.167
Do you want to go check it out?

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:49.535
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:54.173
I love how people are immediately
just getting water right now.

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:56.008
This is easily
the coolest thing ever.

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:57.844
Nolan here is a professional dancer.

00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:58.845
He will join.

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:00.546
How do I always end up dancing?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.781
What is he doing?

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.383
Oh, gosh.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.586
I won't make you watch this anymore.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.654
Besides
ensuring access to clean water,

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:11.691
a lot of the students
at this village lack transportation.

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:14.293
So we decided to give all of them
new bicycles.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.165
I know it looks like a lot of kids,
but we bought a lot of bikes.

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.034
Full disclosure,
I don't know how to ride a bike.

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:23.402
Jimmy only knows how to give away
bikes.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:24.570
Never learned how to ride one. Well,
that's great.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.672
Let's break in all the new bicycles.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:29.108
Three, two, one, go.

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:31.410
Everyone's passing me.

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:33.279
Be careful, I don’t know
how to ride a bike.

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:34.680
I don't want to hit anyone.

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:35.882
You want to ride it?

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.683
All right, go for it little man.
Okay.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.952
And after giving away the bikes,
we continued

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:41.420
building wells
until we reach...

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:43.256
Well number 69!

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:44.757
This solar powered well

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:47.293
is specially designed
to aid the farmers in this village

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:50.363
by providing more than enough water
for all of their crops

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:54.000
and livestock, even during the dry
season without any electricity.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.701
Each panel is 200 watts.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:57.169
Then it's attached to a pump.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:00.006
That pump can pump 5,000 liters every hour.

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:04.310
Basically, it's unlimited amount of
water for this entire village.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.211
That's incredible.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:08.281
And after we left Zimbabwe,
we wanted to continue to give water

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.283
to communities all across Africa.

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:14.086
So we built more wells in Uganda,
Somalia and Cameroon.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.155
And if you want to see more of
what we did in Cameroon,

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:19.091
there's a whole video about that
coming soon, on the Philanthropy Channel.

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:20.760
Spending time in these villages.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.062
Really, it made me reflect
on the importance of building

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:26.098
wells, how it brings water to farms
to feed the hungry,

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:29.468
how it provides clean conditions
for hospitals, and most importantly,

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:32.672
how it helps the children
of this next generation live long,

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:35.808
healthy lives and build the future
for all of these communities.

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:37.343
We await a new dawn

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:38.711
of clean drinking water.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:39.612
Water is life.

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:43.115
And with some help from the locals,
we finally finished a new bridge

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:46.018
that this community
can use for the next 100 years.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:47.520
Lives have been saved.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.322
Families will come together.

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:50.823
The worries will be gone.

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:53.893
The hundred wells we built in this
video, will change a lot of lives,

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:54.961
but not enough.

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:56.128
Which is why, before you go,

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:59.298
I want to urge you all
to go to beastphilanthropy.org/wells

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:01.701
or click the link in description
and donate money if possible.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:04.470
We're literally not profiting a dime
off this video.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.539
100% of the money
we raise is going to go towards

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:09.375
building more wells like you saw
in this video all around the globe.

00:10:09.408 --> 00:10:11.143
I know it's weird
that a YouTuber has

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:13.479
to do all this stuff,
but someone's got to do it.

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:15.348
And if no one else is,
we're going to do it.

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:16.882
As you can tell, it really does

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:18.985
change the lives of the communities
where we build them.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.220
And finally, well,100.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:24.824
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
