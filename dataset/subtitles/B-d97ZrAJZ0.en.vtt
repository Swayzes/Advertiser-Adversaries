00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.441
(smooth music)

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:05.190
- All right, now that
we're back down to Earth

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.430
after all of that Vision Pro launch stuff,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.840
I've had a chance to go back

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.520
and re-pick up some of the things

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.690
that I was testing that got, like,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.510
interrupted by that week of chaos,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.010
and there is some really good stuff.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.440
The OPPO Find X7 Ultra design

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.330
I really like more than I expected.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.130
The Zenbook Duo, the full screen,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.310
dual screen laptop for
2024, is kind of sick.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.320
And there's some other stuff
that is better than expected.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.900
But the one that stood out to
me maybe the most of them all

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.810
is this guy right here, the OnePlus 12.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.550
This may have flown a
little bit under the radar,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.440
I mean, with everything
that's been going on,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.420
but it's gotten some
improvements from last year,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.450
and it is priced very competitively.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.660
Matter of fact, let's
just start with that. 799.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.540
And you also get a free
upgrade to the 16 gigs of RAM,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.540
half terabyte model for
that price if you pre-order.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.760
It's literally already marked
down to that on Amazon,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.810
so I'll have a link below.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.940
Flagship price, yes,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.070
but when it's competing
theoretically against

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.013
some of the ultra phones, 1,000, 1,200,

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:08.220
$1,300, then suddenly, it's
kind of in the category of, uh,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.530
dare I say, flagship killer?

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.900
So look, it's nearly
the same on the outside.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.360
They found what they like and
they're keeping it consistent.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.820
Same shapes, same camera bump circle

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.380
that kind of melts into the side

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.300
with these neural details around it.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.130
It's still Gorilla Glass 5 on the back,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.660
and there's a new set
of colors and textures,

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.490
but in general, you'd
be forgiven for thinking

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.770
it's nearly the same as last year.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.260
Or maybe you wouldn't, but
don't let that fool you.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.840
Upfront, this screen
is I think the biggest

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.180
noticeable physical
difference from last year.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.320
It gets way brighter, up
to 1,600 nits outdoors,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.420
and it's hitting crazy numbers now.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.510
4,500 nits peak HDR brightness.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.980
Basically, it's super impressive

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.590
and extremely readable
outdoors and in any light.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.110
But it also gets extremely dim too.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.930
Now, I don't like that it's
this curved over the edges,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.370
like, you can see the light fall off

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.170
and the extra reflections
that come with that,

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.520
but basically, from corner
to corner, this 6.8 inch,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.140
1440p LTPO Pro XDR display

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.970
is a real upgrade over last year.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.800
So then the rest of the
upgrades to this phone

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.160
are definitely a case of a
bunch of little changes all,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.630
like, stacking up on top of each other

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.290
to equal a large
difference from last year.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.123
Does that make sense?

00:02:17.123 --> 00:02:19.560
Like, that's what
smartphones are nowadays.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.010
I remember reviewing the OnePlus 1

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.170
and then the OnePlus 2 the next year,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.110
and just the gigantic total shift,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.810
big direction changes
between those two phones.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.220
Nowadays, it's just about, like,

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.170
finding a bunch of clever little things

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.820
and stacking a bunch of
little improvements on top of

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.430
each other, just make the user
experience a little better.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.170
So obviously, if you're
gonna be a flagship killer,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.210
you gotta have the newest chip inside.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.310
So it does, it's the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.260
Not that you'll notice a
whole ton of difference

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.900
side by side with a
Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 phone,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.170
but this phone does have
much better cooling as well,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.790
so it's giving them some
headroom to play with

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.290
slightly boosted clock speeds,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.000
and it's benchmarking right behind

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.520
the gaming phones and the S24 Ultra.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.350
In real world use, that just
means this phone is super fast,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.750
really, really fluid, it's
a smooth phone all the time.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.070
Like, this is something OnePlus

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.900
has done really well for a long time,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.320
even with high performance mode being off

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.940
in the battery settings by default.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.770
But speaking of battery, this phone

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.410
is definitely prioritizing battery,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.210
super long battery life, over, like,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.190
ultra high end performance numbers

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.100
and getting every last
FPS out of the thing,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.320
and as a result, this is a battery champ.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.030
First of all, you just
start with a huge capacity.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.980
So it's got one of the
biggest batteries ever

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.450
in a OnePlus flagship.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.600
It's now a 5,400 milliamp hour battery.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.010
That's bigger than a lot of other phones

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.030
that are ultras now.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.830
And you better believe
they've kept their trademarked

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.540
Super Fast Charging also.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.340
So, it's technically a split battery,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.470
it's dual 2,700 milliamp hours.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.130
and it can juice up at 80 watts wired.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.220
This combination of huge
battery, awesome battery life,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.440
prioritization of battery length,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.350
and ultra fast charging
honestly makes this

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.390
at least a contender to
think about right now

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.790
for battery champ of the year.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.220
Matter of fact, if you
just leave this phone

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.200
and all of its out the box settings,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.480
meaning not in high performance mode,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.790
just regular performance mode by default,

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.070
1080p, which it is out the box,

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.990
and then just auto frame rate,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.750
you can get two full light
days out of this phone.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.850
And then when you finally
do get down to near zero,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.520
you can charge up to half
battery in like 12 minutes.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.660
If you wanna go all the way full,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.970
that's only gonna take about half an hour.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.260
It's just so easy.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.730
And on top of all of that,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.970
there is up to 50 watt wireless charging.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.980
So if you've got a
compatible air booth charger,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.300
you obviously have to buy that separately,

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.640
but the OnePlus 11 didn't
even have wireless charging

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.710
at all, so this is a gigantic improvement.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.080
I almost wanna get greedy
and also wish that there was

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.240
Qi2 support for wireless charging,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.680
but I don't know about you,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.990
but Qi2 has felt like it's off to

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.420
a weird, rocky start,
especially this year.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.760
It's been surprisingly
uncommon for any phones

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.150
to support Qi2 with the
magnets and wireless charging.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.430
This is likely because there seems to be

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.430
a 15 watt charging limit with Qi2 for now,

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.560
so if you wanna do fast wireless charging,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.540
you aren't doing Qi2.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.210
So yeah, no Qi2 wireless, no magnets,

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.190
but very, very fast charging.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.090
Either way, way better display,
better chip, better battery,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.980
and also now the cameras
have gotten an upgrade.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.870
Now, I'm just gonna say,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.420
cameras have been a relatively weak point

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.600
for OnePlus's highest end
phones for a while now.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.670
We've always wanted to
call them flagship killers,

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.220
but people love cameras
in flagship phones,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.350
and it just hasn't quite been able

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.820
to match that highest level.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.210
I'd say now it's on the
acceptable for a flagship level,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.910
but it's not quite beating those yet,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.170
and that's still true about this phone.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.040
Now, this main sensor,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.390
it is actually very slightly different.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.950
Instead of the OnePlus
Opens's Sony LYT-T808 sensor

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.920
is the LYT-808 sensor.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.220
It's two more megapixels,
it's slightly wider aperture

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.480
with the glass in front of it.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.490
Nevertheless, basically,
these OnePlus 12 photos

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.323
aren't going to shock you.

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:59.190
I've done some side by side comparisons.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.750
I've even said this before,

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.420
it's pretty good most of the time.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.290
It's pretty sharp.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.080
It's a little contrastier
than the OnePlus Open.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.670
The HDR effect looks fine.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.190
It just falls apart a little too quickly

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.070
as soon as there's adverse
conditions, especially low light.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.630
But here's the thing,
just for the context of

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.590
that it's not that far behind,
we've already tested this,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.410
because we did the blind
smartphone camera test last year

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.350
with 20 of the best smartphone
cameras in the world,

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.260
and in that test was the OnePlus Open.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.610
So yeah, there's a lot
of software involved

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.750
with these cameras, but basically,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.760
this extremely similar camera system,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.990
in the standard light photo,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.590
it had the third highest ELO
rating behind the two pixels.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.080
Then in portrait mode, it was also top 10.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.020
But in low light, it was
fifth from the bottom,

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.840
right around the Sony and below the Razr.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.180
So in summary, yeah, the
camera system is new,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.210
it does have new hardware, it
has a new zoom and everything,

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.330
but all together, it is just like

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.410
a lot of the other stuff I'm showing you,

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.730
a little bit better than last year.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.830
And that's gonna be good
enough for a lot of people.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.020
Actually, most people most of the time.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.050
But if we wanna consider
it flagship, it's just,

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.810
there is a little bit of a
gap till it reaches the best.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.690
But I'll tell you what, they
even more keep stacking it up.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.780
There are so many little
things about using

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.360
this OnePlus phone that I really like.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.990
Like, I love that I can
specifically force any app I want

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.730
to be at whatever frame rate I want.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.500
Like, there's literally a
list of every single app

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.540
on my phone, and by default,
you've probably noticed,

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.970
all of the mapping apps,
like Waze and Google Maps,

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.160
they always, even on every
other 120 hertz phone,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.380
they always override and run at 60 hertz.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.540
But on this phone, I can just fix it.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.370
Just give me all of the frames, please.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.010
I also love that this phone
has an infrared blaster.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.710
One of the least common
features in the world

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.560
of a modern smartphone alongside,
like, a headphone jack.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.750
But yeah, it literally
lets you turn on and off

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.270
and control appliances remotely

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.610
without having to find the
remote, like this TV here,

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.410
or a stranger's TV, I don't know.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.340
It's the little things.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.520
I love that this USB-C port
not only supports basically

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.770
the fastest charging we've
ever seen on a phone in the US,

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.390
but also supports extremely
fast data transfer speeds.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.810
This is a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.260
The names and generations
are horrible at this point

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.310
and incredibly confusing.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.590
All you really need to know
is that this has basically

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.860
the best data speeds
available from a USB-C phone.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.570
So if you get the right cable,

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.970
you can get large files, like videos,

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.860
on and off of the device real quick.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.090
And then a lot of you will probably love

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.990
that this new screen
supports high PWM dimming.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.550
If you've never heard of this before,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.840
it might not even matter to you,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.270
but there is a select
fraction of the population

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.540
that is specifically
sensitive to the flickering

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.880
that becomes visible
at super low brightness

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.890
with a lot of these
smartphone OLED displays,

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.510
to the point where,
like, it causes headaches

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.343
and eye fatigue.

00:08:43.343 --> 00:08:45.780
So, some smartphones, including this one,

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.160
are now addressing it with

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.980
super high pulse-width modulation.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.870
Basically, they still flicker on and off

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.790
to get that lower perceived brightness,

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.180
but much, much faster than
the human eye can perceive,

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.490
2,160 hertz in this phone's case.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.800
So, it still appears liquid smooth

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.140
at all brightness
levels, which is awesome.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.110
If you use your phone in
the rain or when it's wet,

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.300
you probably already know
how chaotic that feels.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.230
Like, there's memes about it.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.570
Like, it just seems to
kind of act on its own

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.460
when there's water droplets on the screen.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.530
But this phone claims that

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.440
with a new technology called Aqua Touch,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.440
it will totally remain as usable as ever,

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.150
even with water all over the screen.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.650
Now, you might have seen the ads for it.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.130
It might sound ridiculous,
but it actually works.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.680
It's not perfect, obviously,
but you can definitely feel

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.930
that it's dramatically more responsive,

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.730
to the point where I
can actually type things

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.250
on this wet phone screen,
where I just would not

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.170
wanna do that on any
other phone without this.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.510
Kind of feels like magic.
I am very impressed.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.700
And then there's even just
extra little tiny things

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.390
on top of that, like 12
or 16 gigs of fast RAM.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.610
That's sick. Future-proof.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.910
Also, Dolby Atmos with
spatial audio support. Great.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.080
It also has great haptics.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.660
Like, all this tiny stuff adds up

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.880
to be a great overall experience.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.640
But it's not perfect, right?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.320
Let's be real. No phone is perfect.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.700
But at least I can say about this phone

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.330
that also the downsides are
also a couple small things.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.160
Like, I, for one, I've
already talked about this,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.230
but I'm kind of over the curved displays,

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.380
so, this one keeping that,
it's not a deal breaker,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.630
like, you might even argue
it's a little more character

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.940
to this phone in the
world of 2024 smartphones,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.100
but it definitely has its downsides.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.350
from the glare to the light fall off

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.060
to the drop test durability.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.800
But okay, fine, they've gone curved.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.200
But then the fingerprint sensor underneath

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.830
is also still a pretty
average optical sensor.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.690
Doesn't feel like it's
been upgraded in years.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.920
And then for having the new
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip inside,

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.870
which a lot of other flagships do,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.060
this phone doesn't really have

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.900
any of the AI features, like, at all,

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.460
and this is something I
wanted to keep an eye on

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.630
with all these phones coming out

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.150
with this chip early in
this year, which is, okay,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.970
Qualcomm puts out a new chip,
small performance gains,

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:01.800
small efficiency gains, but
also huge new AI capabilities,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.790
and this phone kind of
just skipped the AI part.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.710
Now, not that that's a disaster,

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.590
but those were some
genuinely useful features.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.040
The only one I found on this
phone is in the photo editor,

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.080
and it's called AI Palettes,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.570
but it's just like a color overlay.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.920
I don't even really think there's

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.230
that much AI going on with this at all.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.200
So, none of that generative
fill, crop correction,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.270
none of that Magic Editor stuff,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.140
none of that auto live
transcription of phone calls

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.150
or live translation of phone calls,

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.610
none of that, like, speaker
labels in the voice app,

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.680
none of the auto summaries in the browser

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.170
or anything like that, just none of it.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.003
It's not on this phone.

00:11:41.003 --> 00:11:42.270
And then also, random bug.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.840
I don't know, but every time
I'm in the overlay browser

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.820
and I reach up to my
favorite little alert slider

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.800
on the OnePlus phone and change modes,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.680
it opens a search box,
like, to find in page.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.510
I don't know why, they
shouldn't be connected,

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.830
but it does it every single time.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.470
But maybe the biggest legitimate
downside of this phone

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.360
when you're comparing it
to the other flagships

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.540
it's going up against is it's promised

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.570
fewer years of software update support.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.400
Now, I've already gotten a
pretty major software update

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.990
since I started testing this phone,

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.640
big camera improvements and bug fixes,

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.960
stuff like that, great,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.660
but they are only
promising, only promising,

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.250
four years of software updates

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.530
and five years of security updates.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.080
Now, that's fine, a lot of
people will only plan on

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.520
keeping this phone for
three or four years,

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.890
maybe five years before
moving on to the next one,

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.130
but in the world of the
flagships, the Pixels,

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:30.990
the Samsungs of the
world, even the iPhones

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.410
giving you six or seven
years of software updates,

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.230
this is just notably behind on that.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.170
And maybe OnePlus didn't
think it was worth

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.490
the extra resources,

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.650
it doesn't think people
care that much about it

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.960
to actually spend money on
it to put the resources in,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.350
but yeah, four or five versus seven.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.233
So, is this a flagship killer?

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.300
Well, that just depends on your

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.890
definition of a flagship, doesn't it?

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.110
I think this is probably
the most compelling thing

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.700
about this phone, is going to be

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.830
how competitively priced it is,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.900
because it's very similar
in a lot of ways to,

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.870
let's call it S24 Ultra, right?

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.060
But I've seen this phone,
the 16 gigs of RAM,

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.870
half terabyte version,
for 899 on their site.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:17.130
But if you pre-order it,
you can get that for 799.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.900
But they're also advertising
it in a lot of places for 699,

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.630
because they're apparently
just giving you 100 bucks

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.990
for a trade-in of any
phone, in any condition.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.110
So, if you're going with 699

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.960
and this phone starts at 1,300 bucks,

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.140
then yeah, that is a damn good deal.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.780
So yeah, I'd just be looking
at what's important to you.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.440
I would say if camera is
really important to you,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.750
or if long-term software support

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.640
is actually super high on your list,

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.730
or if any of those AI features
looked really compelling

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.260
or really interesting
that you'd want them,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.300
then you'd probably end up going with

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.890
one of those other flagships.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.230
But for everything else,
like, for performance,

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.870
for a great screen,
for incredible battery,

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.790
super fast charging, ultra smooth,

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.160
like, this phone is better
than you probably think.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.110
Oh, and on top of all that, OnePlus also

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.150
around the same time has
released this phone right here.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.630
It looks almost the same,
but this is the OnePlus 12R.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.690
And this is just a a
budgetedized, budgetized?

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.050
A budget version even more
so than this phone already,

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.700
just basically cutting a few corners.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.440
A few corners on the camera, right?

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.560
It's a Snapdragon 8 Gen
2 instead of the Gen 3.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.390
There's no wireless
charging, things like that.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.870
It's IP64 instead of IP65, whatever.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.760
It's a slightly trimmed down version.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.260
Again, 500 bucks. I'm just saying.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.290
So, if these phones weren't
already on your radar,

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.970
they probably should be.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.700
Thanks for watching, catch
you guys in the next one.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.773
Peace.

00:14:45.773 --> 00:14:48.356
(smooth music)
