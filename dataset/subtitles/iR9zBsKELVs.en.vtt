00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.790
- You know, if you've
been watching my videos,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.050
you've noticed a certain sentence

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.850
that I've been saying for years.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.263
I've been saying, small flagship
phones are a rare breed.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.750
And I say that countless
times over the years,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.783
but today, that's no longer true.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.283
That breed is now extinct.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.153
RIP to the small flagship phone.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.280
Okay, we don't even
have to rewind that far

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.160
to the days when phones were
all smaller across the board.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.830
But then really quickly, we
shot up to four-inch screens,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.870
then five inch screens were popular,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.330
then six inch flagships were everywhere.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.700
We never quite got to seven
inch phones being mainstream,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.800
but it seems like all of
the biggest flagships now

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.600
are teetering right around that.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.730
But the funny part is
smartphone manufacturers

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.820
have had the same realization
over and over again,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.280
which is that, oh, smartphone
screens are getting bigger.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.520
And so there's room for the
smaller alternative phone

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.230
to slot in underneath that.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.860
So like I just reviewed every
single Samsung Galaxy S ever.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.810
The year that they
started to get really big,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.050
they, of course, also
introduced a Galaxy S Mini.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.730
It's the most Samsung thing ever.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.680
But guess what? Now that's dead.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.513
Same thing from Apple.

00:01:11.513 --> 00:01:13.140
We finally got huge iPhones,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.170
and then sure enough, we got
an iPhone Mini for two years,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.490
but now that's dead too.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.200
And this kept happening and
happening all over the place

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.310
until there was basically

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.260
just one good small flagship phone left.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.040
The Asus Zenfone, the rare breed.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.460
So this thing, the
Zenfone 9 came out in 2022

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.880
and was a nearly perfect flagship phone.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.150
Like seriously flagship
specs, incredible performance,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.660
physics defying battery life,
like rock solid cameras.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.020
This phone won my small phone
of the year by a landslide,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.180
even with the few tiny
flaws it had, you know,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.940
the back material being
a little less durable

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.440
and it didn't have wireless charging.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.020
So then in 2023, they
came out with a sequel,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.130
the Zenfone 10.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.980
And that took a good thing
and basically perfected it.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.660
They fixed the back material,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.030
they gave it wireless
charging, they upgraded it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.470
to the latest flagship chips.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.650
They didn't lose anything.
Nothing went wrong.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.560
It was just this singular,
excellent flagship phone

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.530
with a less than six inch screen in 2023.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.720
So now it's 2024,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.720
and the new Zenfone is a
gigantic 6.8 inch ultra phone.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.860
Now, honestly, we probably

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.390
should have seen this coming, right?

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.300
When has a small flagship ever lasted

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.400
more than a year or two, right?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.230
But it just, I don't know,
it hits a little harder

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.450
when this was the last small one.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.940
Like here's something
to think about, right?

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.960
I think Apple is, you could
argue, one of the best

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.110
supply chain companies
in the world, right?

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.400
That's how they built their business.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.180
That's how Tim Cook took the
stock price from here to here.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.420
That's what they do. Tim
Cook is the supply chain guy.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.030
So every time they come
out with a new product

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.140
or a range of products,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.880
they have to do the supply chain thing

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.910
and figure out exactly how
many they need to produce.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.070
So they have these complex studies

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.390
and they're ways of estimating

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.420
how many they think will be
sold of every single SKU.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.250
And then that's how
many they need to make.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.130
Not too many, just the perfect amount,

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.410
perfect inventory management.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.320
That's the supply chain thing.
That's Tim Cook's thing.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.260
So in 2020, for the first
time, Apple decided to release

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.510
a new lineup of four new iPhones.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.680
It was iPhone 12, iPhone
12 Pro, the 12 Pro Max,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.090
and the 12 Mini.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.520
Of course, the 12 and the
12 Pro are the same size,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.140
right in the middle, this
nice little sweet spot

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.930
of the lineup, and the
12 Pro Max just being

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.680
this absolute maxed out,
biggest screen, biggest price.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.620
But then the cheapest
most pocketable new iPhone

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.500
in the lineup is this cute
new little Mini phone.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.520
Now, Apple, Tim Cook, the all
the supply chain knowledge

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.720
and the studies they've put in,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.040
they already know small phones
don't sell particularly well.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.230
So they make all of their changes

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.950
and line up how many of each
they're going to produce.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.500
And then they send it, they
send it all into production.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.780
And you know, reviews,
honestly, for the most part,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.400
were super positive across the board.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.720
People love the Mini phone.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.780
Yes, the battery life is
weaker on the smaller phone,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.530
but to put a flagship
shape and a flagship chip

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.230
and a flagship camera in a Mini phone,

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.820
it is just such a rare thing.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.800
So it was extremely well received.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.530
Tech reviewers love it.
Real users are loving it.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.270
YouTube videos are loving on the thing.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.270
And the Mini iPhone still
sold dramatically less

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.250
than what Apple had prepared for it to.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.360
There are some surveys that
have the Mini iPhone at like 5%

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.420
of the total sales of the
entire new iPhone 12 lineup,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.620
sometimes even less.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.290
I mean, it was really, really unpopular

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.460
in the grand scheme of things

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.850
to actually buy an iPhone 12 Mini.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.580
So suddenly it went from being
the darling of the lineup

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.000
to the least successful
new iPhone of all time.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.220
And the headlines were all over this

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.860
and sort of wondering if they
would even try this again.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.530
And they did for one more year,
they did an iPhone 13 Mini.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.360
It did even worse than the 12 Mini.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.280
And then it was quietly discontinued.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.470
And guess what was in its place?

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.980
A brand new plus sized
iPhone. Because of course.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.770
So the moral of the story is
the Mini iPhone experiment

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.460
reinforced what we already
knew, which is not enough people

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.690
actually buy small phones
to be worth it for a company

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.600
even of Apple size, to
put in all the research

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.490
and development to keep
making these things.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.323
Like some people think,

00:05:30.323 --> 00:05:31.740
oh, this thing is
getting positive reviews,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.910
so it must be a success.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.050
Not always true.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.050
And also the counter, if things
are getting negative reviews

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.020
from YouTubers, that must be why it died.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.100
Also, not always true.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.540
So now here we go with the Zenfone.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.690
Now, here's the thing, not to
discount the Zenfone 11 ultra,

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.310
it's actually a really good phone.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.370
In fact, it's a perfectly
fine, large flagship phone.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.470
It brings all the good
things about Zenfone 10

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.190
to a bigger scale, bigger
battery, awesome battery life.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.340
The latest chips and specs,
again, lightweight software

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.680
and smooth performance,
rock solid cameras.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.470
It actually added a
third telephoto camera.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.490
So it's all here.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.650
It just loses the biggest thing,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.680
or I guess the smallest thing
that really made it different.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.990
Just the fact that it was actually small

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.730
and reachable from corner to corner

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.440
and didn't require huge pockets

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.780
or huge hands to comfortably dil it.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.190
All of that is gone.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.840
And now it's just like a ROG
phone minus the gamer stuff.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.240
Actually, seriously, that's
basically what it is.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.050
This is the new Zenfone
next to the new ROG phone.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.490
If you take away the screen on the back,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.330
the 165 hertz display, the side USBC port,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.130
the shoulder triggers,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.860
honestly, it's basically the same phone.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.590
So this Zenfone just
feels like it's blending

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.930
into the sea of other giant phones.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.620
If I was guessing,
Zenfone 9 and Zenfone 10,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.430
despite how much we loved
them, didn't sell very well.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.310
And so they moved on,
kind of the same way,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.190
that iPhone 12 Mini and 13 Mini

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.930
didn't sell particularly well.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.140
The last part of that equation,
the fun fact is, even today,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.460
the most popular new iPhone
is still the Pro and Pro Max,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.950
the super high end biggest phone.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.110
And so what did Asus do?

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.890
They made a super high-end big phone.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.870
Now, to be perfectly super clear,

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.060
Asus technically hasn't confirmed

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.240
that they're not going to
make a regular Zenfone 11,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.380
but the body language suggests
that this is the only one.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.050
They just sort rename it the way Apple

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.420
just stopped making the Mini
and started making a Plus.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.710
We just assume the Mini's gone.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.180
So there's no solution to this.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.180
It's right in line with the
enthusiast phone dilemma.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.950
Whenever a phone manufacturer comes along

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.750
and starts making an enthusiast phone,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.900
it gathers a really, really hot audience

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.600
for that specific device, but it's small,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.220
and so when they end
up trying to branch out

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.220
and make it more successful,
they lose the core fans.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.860
And I don't know if this Zenfone's
gonna lose the core fans,

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.450
but people who liked it for being small

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.850
certainly aren't gonna
like this one anymore.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.340
And this even applies
to budget phones too.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.530
You know, small budget
phones are getting bigger.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.350
Pixel 7A is a 6.1 inch phone.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.120
The Nothing Phone 2a that just came out

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.670
is literally an ultra sized phone.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.460
And rumors of the next
iPhone SE also point

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.440
to that being not small.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.330
So the void is now open.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.620
You know, someone might
come along and make

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.010
another small flagship phone
to briefly fill that void,

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.523
but don't expect it to last too long.

00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:33.949
RIP, the small flagship phone.

00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:36.532
(light music)
