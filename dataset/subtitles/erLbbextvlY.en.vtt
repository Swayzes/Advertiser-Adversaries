00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.670
We are now stranded on this deserted
island in the middle of the ocean,

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:06.573
and we're going to be stranded here
for the next seven days.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.442
And that boat that just left
was our only way out of here.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.711
- Why do we keep doing this?
- I thought it'd be fun.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.079
Despite its beauty,

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:18.018
civilization has not been able to survive
on this island for over 250 years.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.587
But for the next seven days,
we're going to try to.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.822
And we only have around 4 hours
until it gets dark.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:23.790
It's hot out here.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.291
We need to build a shelter
immediately.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.827
I mean, why don't we just camp here?
This spot looks pretty good.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:31.131
So I say we kick things off by us
going and looking for wood.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:32.665
And you two...

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.901
- We'll prep camp.
- Yes.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.836
Have fun with that.
Come on Shawn, come on Chandler.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.772
- How do we prep camp?
- You know, I don't know.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.874
And so we immediately got to work.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.008
But we had to be careful,

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.911
because above you
is the most dangerous tree on earth.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:48.648
It contains poisonous tree sap
that can literally kill you.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.116
Why are we still standing here?

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.786
And meanwhile,
Nolan and Mack were making a fire pit.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.523
I'd say it's a pretty good fire,
would you say?

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:57.590
Well, it's not a fire yet.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.025
Well, I'd say
it's a pretty good fireplace.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.528
And Shawn started
constructing the frame for a shelter.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.663
Are you sure
that's not going to fall on us?

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:04.230
Yeah.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.766
- I feel like Shawn's a survival dad.
- I've been called worse.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.535
And while
gathering some more materials,

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.670
we came across
some wildlife on the island.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.472
Bro,
look at these chickens over here.

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:13.840
Hey, wait! Stop running away.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.010
It wasn't long until I found out
why the chickens were afraid of us.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.812
Hey, what are we doing over here?

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.413
Wait. What is that?

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:21.081
Oh, it's a knife.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.715
Were you going to try to kill
one of those chickens?

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.484
- Please let me eat the chicken.
- We don't kill chickens.

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:26.386
Jimmy, what'd you eat for dinner
before you got here?

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:27.153
Don't ask.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.656
We spent the rest
of the day one preparing our camp,

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.157
which was pretty simple.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.492
I'm going to show
you guys around the camp.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:35.261
This is the fire where we're going
to make food. Come over here.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.231
And this is where we sleep.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.332
That concludes the tour.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.167
We pulled over our survival crate,
which contains

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:45.071
food, water and most importantly,
a flare in case someone gets hurt.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.241
And by the time the sun went down,
we had everything figured out.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.876
Except for one thing

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.012
Wait, hold up.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.514
Isn't sunscreen flammable?

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.584
It's the end of day one.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.619
And I'm already starting
to get a little sunburned.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.221
I'm hoping to get some good sleep tonight.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.489
And I hope it doesn't
rain.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.023
Tomorrow we need to build a bigger shelter.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.759
And by we, I mean dad over there is
gonna build a bigger shelter.

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:07.727
- I got you.
- I got... Oh.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.131
Jimmy, you're like mom,
Shawn's dad.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:12.999
I'm just going to go to bed.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.667
I'll see you on day two.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.837
During the first night of sleep,
we tossed and turned a lot.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.507
And by we, I mean me.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.743
So it was a good thing
we were fixing this the next day.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.778
The objective for day two is simple.

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:28.314
We need to build a bigger
and rain proof shelter.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.984
We need more comfortable seats
because my butt hurts

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.485
and we need a better fire pit.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:33.720
My butt also hurts.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.191
We're looking for very long,
sturdy sticks

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.826
we can put across the top
of our shelter.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.263
That way, when it rains instead of it
drooping in the leaves and tarp,

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:44.531
it flows off the back.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:47.600
And while we were busy gathering
resources for our new shelter,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.869
Mack and Nolan we're busy
looking for new seats.

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.171
- Do you see that?
- Yeah.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.071
What's that orange thing?

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.873
I mean, you could use it
as like a bouncy seat.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.841
Dude, it's a buoy.

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.042
Oh dude, there's a net.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:57.644
We could use a net to catch chickens.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.280
Oh, a lot of bugs, a lot of bugs.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.314
A lot of bugs.

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:04.217
Jimmy, we found an ocean buoy.
It's like a bouncy seat.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.818
- Did you steal this?
- No.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:07.687
Did he steal it?

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.688
It washed up on a beach.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:10.657
I guess that's not stealing.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.960
Oh, that is nice.
Ok, I'll take it.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.297
 For the rest of the day, Chandler, Shawn
and I finished upgrading the shelter.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:18.565
Keep going. Keep going.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.367
There's still sun in here,
but it's because the sun's super low.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.469
90% of the time,
this will be shade now.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:25.672
While Mack and Nolan got coconuts.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.640
- All right.
- Be careful, it's a big knife.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.377
Coconut.

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:33.580
That's good.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.115
And, of course, trying to catch
chickens.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:39.385
Hey chickens, run, run, run away.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.420
What are you doing?

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.487
All right. I saved them.

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.457
Day two is coming to an end.

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:45.525
How would you say it was?

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.227
I'm tired, but I'm doing good.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.995
- Nolan?
- Fantastic.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:50.296
I think we can all agree

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:52.165
we are doing way
better than we thought we would.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.466
But little did I know.

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:56.636
Later that night, things
were about to get a whole lot worse.

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:58.137
But for now,

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:00.473
if you're wondering why
we're in the ocean, look at Chandler.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.276
Because it's
the only way for us to shower.

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:05.178
We need our other water for cooking and

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:08.014
you know, not dying of dehydration.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.318
You want to know what I noticed,
boys?

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:13.219
What's that?

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:17.190
We had ten carts of water,
and now we're down to six.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.458
It's day two.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.225
I know.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:20.893
I'm going to be the adult here

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:21.728
and just say it.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:25.164
Everyone needs to be more responsible
with their water consumption.

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:25.999
I agree.

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.267
Wait, what are we agreeing to?

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.469
- Shawn, I agreed for you.
- Okay, perfect.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:30.870
It's also dark, we need to go to bed.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:32.238
In case you didn't piece it together.

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:35.041
That guy Mack is the guy
that lost money in this video.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:35.642
And this video.

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:39.345
He's basically lost $1.5 million on
the channel in the last two months.

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.247
It's a harsh way to introduce
somebody.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.882
Even though we upgraded our shelter,

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:45.451
the second night of sleep was worse
than the first.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.421
We didn't know it,
but this island was infested

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.391
with bugs that ended up
biting us all throughout the night.

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:54.627
And for whatever reason,
Chandler and I got the worst of it.

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:58.231
I got no sleep last night.

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:00.066
Probably the most miserable thing
I've ever done

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:02.568
Look how many bug bites
I have on just my hand alone.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.404
Do you see that?

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:06.706
And while we caught up
on some much needed sleep,

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:10.977
you can probably guess what the boys
are going to do without supervision.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.211
Catch chickens.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:13.846
No, let's catch fish.

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:18.318
So yesterday, over by that debris on the
beach, me and Nolan found a bunch of net.

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:21.988
Today, the boys are going to help me
make a chicken trap.

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.590
The plan is basically
to put a giant net right here

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:26.793
tied to a string up there, and then

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.561
catch a chicken.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:29.262
Let's go.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:31.998
Now, if I was awake to stop them,
this never would have happened.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:35.501
But given the fact that I felt like
I was literally dying in this moment.

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.770
The boys were officially going rogue.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.005
That is a strong net.

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:39.906
Is that?

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:41.140
There we go.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.011
Over the next 30 minutes or so, the
boys cut the net into a perfect square.

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.280
They then hoisted the rope up
over the tree,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.083
tied the rope to all four corners,
and it was ready.

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:52.051
That works.

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:52.919
That's pretty nice.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.987
So after a quick reset
and placing some bait,

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.622
it was time to catch a chicken.

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:59.192
- What is this?
- Trap to catch chickens with?

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:00.860
- Can I see the rope?
-  No, you cannot.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.495
Is that what you guys are doing
this whole time?

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:03.529
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:05.131
Thought you were doing
something actually productive.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:05.865
I'll be honest.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.334
At first, this seemed
like a complete waste of time,

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.871
because for the next 3 hours,
they waited and waited,

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:15.508
But for some reason, Mack in particular
was not ready to give up.

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:18.578
And finally, after
even more waiting...

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:27.453
Yeah.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:29.422
Keep it tight, keep it tight.

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:30.423
Keep it tight.

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:31.758
Mack, what is that?

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:33.159
Jimmy, I caught it.

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:35.495
Oh, this chick is actually
pretty chill.

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:35.962
Yeah.

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:38.798
This is the new Bryan
in honor of the bird from raft

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:39.532
You know what?

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:42.235
With how nice you've been, I'm
sure once you put Bryan down,

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:43.603
it'll continue to hang out with us.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:45.705
Put it down.

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:46.739
Time to put Bryan down.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.775
Bryan, no, Bryan.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.144
What did you do to Bryan?

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:52.111
I thought he was our friend.

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:53.980
Well,
I did catch him with a trap, so.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.816
And by the time Bryan had been caught
and freed,

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:59.318
it had gotten significantly
less hot outside,

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:02.889
which honestly gave all of us enough
energy for a spontaneous adventure.

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:04.357
See that island behind me?

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.460
- We're about to go to it Mack.
- Let's do it.

00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:08.594
Now I know what you're thinking.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:13.132
Why swim away from a perfectly good island
to a rock in the middle of the ocean?

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.001
And honestly,
I don't have a good answer for you.

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:17.003
This feels really counterintuitive.

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:19.806
I think this is a testament to just
how bored we are.

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.108
Feels like we're wasting
a lot of water and energy.

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:23.409
Mack, what are you doing?

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.378
Dude, there are so many fish down there.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.546
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.080
There's a stingray,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.382
look at all those fish.

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:32.151
Those waves
look really big over there.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.486
And they're coming right at us.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:35.688
Here comes a big one.

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:36.789
Almost there.

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.862
Look at the island over there
in the background,

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.931
And here we are.

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:46.566
Look at this.

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:48.601
We've got water splashing on both sides.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.336
These are extra slippery rocks.

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:51.337
We are going up now?

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.071
Oh gosh.

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:53.406
Oh, this is crazy.

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.740
This looks so cool.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.975
We did it.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:58.644
I don't know why we did it,
but we did.

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.347
How do we get off this?

00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:03.049
And then how do we get back
to our island?

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.684
Well, the fastest way off is jumping.

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:05.852
I'm not jumping.

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.720
During our last
few hours of sunlight.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.855
I felt a couple raindrops.

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:11.224
We noticed the storm
approaching us on the horizon.

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:12.124
We got on the island.

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:14.126
The forecast said
it wasn't supposed to rain.

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:15.728
There's monster clouds over there.

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:16.496
We need to prep.

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:17.263
Let's go boys.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.764
Nolan, fix it!

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:19.532
Fix the hut.

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:21.133
- Oh, no.
- There's rain coming.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:21.934
Protect our stuff.

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:23.903
Get as many palm leaves
as you can right now.

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:25.137
Chandler, more leaves.

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:26.672
And once we ran out of daylight,

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:29.075
we huddled up under our new
and improved shelter

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.810
and awaited a night of rain.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.879
The worst part about
this is the unknown.

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:34.480
It's so dark.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.549
You can't even see how close
the rain is anymore.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.351
Turns out we got extremely lucky.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.920
The storm ended up
just missing us by a hair.

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:44.724
But what I can say is, later in this
video, we won't be so lucky.

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:45.858
What do we do, it's raining?

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:48.427
Dude, it's literally pouring,
help me hold this up.

00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:49.929
I just want to go home.

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:51.631
Good morning, everybody.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.033
Let me try that again.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.701
Good morning, everybody.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:56.736
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.304
You guys got a case of the Mondays?

00:08:58.337 --> 00:08:59.805
After four days on the island,

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:02.008
our morning routine
consisted of the following.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.577
First, we'd wake up and complain
about how bad we slept.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.812
Sleeping last night was rough.

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:09.515
And then we'd use the bathroom,
sometimes together.

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.918
I'm nervous peeing at the same time
as you guys.

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:14.186
And then eat yet again, a bagged meal.

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:17.590
We're a little tired of our bag
meals, so let's just say

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.158
we've got a solution.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.563
All right,
This is as far as I go. Have fun.

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:25.831
- Oh, good.
- All this for some fish?

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:28.801
You have to go very,
very far out to actually find fish.

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:30.870
The fish aren't going to be in this,
like, blue water.

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:33.706
They're going to be in the dark
blue water out there. So...

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:36.075
This will be a really good idea,
or a really bad one.

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:37.176
Probably a bad one.

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:40.880
The plan was a little dangerous,
but simple, Mack is going to act

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:42.148
as a human motorboat

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:45.384
and drag Shawn and Nolan
out into the depths of the ocean.

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:48.321
And Shawn being the expert survival
dad that he is.

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:49.789
is going to catch those fish

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:51.791
and bring them back to shore for us to eat.

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:53.492
You guys got the rope?

00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:56.228
I also brought around 500 feet
of rope that they're tied to.

00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:58.664
So if at any point they need help,
we'll just yank them in.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:09:59.465
Right Chandler?

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:00.099
Yeah.

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.500
Is the rope still good?

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:02.868
Yeah, you have plenty of rope.

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:04.103
Mack, you doing okay?

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:06.439
Is Mack literally just pulling them?

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.574
We should just untie the rope Mack,

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:09.709
because that's some dead weight.

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:10.943
Hope you don't regret it.

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:15.281
Now we have no rope,
and we're so far away from the beach.

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:17.617
There's no way they're not getting
seasick out there.

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:18.618
Oh, look at that storm.

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:20.653
- Is that a storm?
- Boys, we better hurry.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.787
- That's rain?
- That's rain.

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:23.923
Something tells me
this rope snapped somewhere.

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.257
Oh, no.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.359
You know what we can do?

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:27.226
We can start fishing.

00:10:27.226 --> 00:10:29.128
I wouldn't start fishing yet,
he's in the water.

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:31.397
- Guys!
- Your rope came off.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.635
- You see any fish down there?
- I don't see anything.

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:36.335
None yet.

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:37.470
We have the rope.

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:41.574
- Oh, you got something?
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:46.178
- We got a fish.
- Hold on, hold on to it.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:47.780
- Yeah.
- We got him.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.315
- Fish!
- Yeah!

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:51.183
Fish!

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:55.554
And after 2 hours of fishing and
200 fishes worth of calories burned,

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:57.723
all they had
to show for it was one fish.

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:01.127
Is this fine to eat?

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:01.994
Yeah, of course.

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:04.930
It literally tastes like fish
from the supermarket.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.766
I mean, you know where fish
in the supermarket come from, right?

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:08.000
- Where?
- The ocean.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.903
And even though this fish from
the ocean was surprisingly good,

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.239
it was time to eat something
a whole lot better.

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:14.040
S'mores.

00:11:14.073 --> 00:11:14.607
S'mores.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.209
First off, you need to burn
the bacteria off your stick.

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:18.144
Oh, I didn't know that, actually.

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:19.712
You seem like you've done s'mores before,
Jim.

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:21.514
Well, as a man who owns
a chocolate company.

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:24.450
Oh, Mack.
What are you doing?

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:25.685
Oh, God.

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:28.287
You take the Feastables chocolate,
scrunch it like that

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.622
while it's still hot,

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:30.690
Look at that.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.358
Make sure to try out
our new Feastables bar.

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.226
People are actually liking it
so much.

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:35.628
It's sold out in most stores.

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:37.963
Don't worry. We're doing our best
to restock it as fast as we can.

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:39.699
You've never had a s'more
in your life

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.901
until you've had a s'more
with Feastables on it.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:45.438
Like clockwork, we lay down
and go to bed and it starts raining.

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:48.040
Why is it that whenever we do
survival videos,

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.276
it literally only rains
when we're trying to sleep?

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:52.445
I'd say
that was a very successful day for.

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:53.512
- Yeah.
- I agree.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:54.513
You caught a chicken.

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:55.381
I caught a fish.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.750
Here's
the three more days of stupidity.

00:11:58.317 --> 00:11:59.919
Yeah.

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:07.560
I just woke up,

00:12:07.593 --> 00:12:08.761
I have no idea what day it is.

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:09.995
It's day...

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:10.796
Five.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.465
I was about to say that.

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:15.134
One of the reasons
why we picked this island

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:18.037
is there's very old houses or ruins,

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:19.672
whatever
you want to call it, on this island.

00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:21.874
And even though they're located
on top of a mountain,

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:23.776
I say today's the day
we explore them.

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.311
- I agree.
- Disagree.

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:26.545
Now that we had all agree

00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:28.614
to go to the ruins,
we want to make sure we didn't

00:12:28.614 --> 00:12:30.649
start this expedition
on an empty stomach.

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:31.250
And just as

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.353
we were eating our bagged breakfast,
no one noticed something more

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:35.921
appetizing down the beach.

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:36.889
Over there on the shoreline.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.324
- What is it?
- There's a goat.

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:39.091
No way, bro.

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:39.992
There's a goat.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.162
- Mack, you cannot eat that.
- You can't stop me.

00:12:43.362 --> 00:12:44.330
No.

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:45.998
- Run away goat.
- Jimmy!

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:48.067
Run away, goat.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.569
Get out of here. Yes.

00:12:50.736 --> 00:12:52.738
- Why would you do that?
- He's our friend.

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.407
No, he's not is food.

00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:57.510
Once again,
Jimmy scared away my food.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.879
And after sparing
another animal from Mack,

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:01.914
it was time to adventure
to the ruins.

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:03.215
All right, let's do it.

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:05.951
- We're almost out of water, guys.
- I need some for the adventure.

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:08.053
I'm gonna trying to fill these up
with coconut water while you're gone.

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:09.321
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:10.990
Yeah. Keep going.
I'll be there in one second.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.392
And what they don't know is
I actually have a surprise

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:15.528
waiting for us
at the top of the ruins.

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:17.163
It'll make sense in a little bit.

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:17.763
That was kind of weird,

00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:19.331
how you just stayed back
and talked to the camera.

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.801
Yeah, kind of like how you lost $1.5
million.

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:23.302
Oh, yeah.

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:24.470
Follow me, gang.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.437
Jimmy, I believe in you.

00:13:25.437 --> 00:13:27.239
For a second, I thought
this was the mountain.

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:29.809
Forgot, we haven't even reached
the base of the mountain yet.

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.912
And while we climb this mountain, I'm
going to tell the boys about Western Union.

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:35.514
Wherever you are, Western Union
makes it easy to send money

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:37.249
to friends and family anywhere
in the world.

00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:38.150
We'll be up here.

00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:39.451
Yeah, you keep talking about that Jim.

00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:40.419
Hey, wait up for me.

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:41.420
We'll go all the way up there?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:46.425
Western Union also has a free website
and app that's simple and secure.

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:47.693
So even my Grandma can use it?

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:48.861
Even your Grandma, Mack.

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:52.832
And before I got here
I used Western Union to pay the boat...

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:54.466
You got to be careful.

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:55.601
Here, give me a second Western Union.

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.303
I also use Western Union to pay

00:13:57.303 --> 00:13:59.338
the boat guy that dropped me off
on this island.

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:01.240
Because they had been
around for a 100 years.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.210
I know my money got to them
even though I was in the U.S..

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:07.646
Look how far away
we've come from our beach.

00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:08.614
Dude, is that a rainbow?

00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:09.548
Rainbow right there?

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:10.516
- Oh yeah.
- What the heck?

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:11.550
That's awesome.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.753
I'm not going to be like a Debbie
Downer, but that's rain right there.

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:15.454
That giant cloud?

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:16.522
That giant cloud with the rain coming up.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:17.423
You're being a Debbie Downer.

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:19.291
Hey, you can see Shawn from here.

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:20.693
Dude, he's building the shelter.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:21.827
Shawn's making us dinner.

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:23.095
Shawn!

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:26.265
I can see you.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:29.368
He heard us.

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:30.569
Keep going.

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.137
Wave if you're a nerd.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:33.873
Oh, he's waving.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.808
Is it going to be dark when
we go back on this path?

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:36.208
Yeah.

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:38.244
- How are we going to see?
- Oh, we'll figure that out later.

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:40.079
That's going to be unfortunate
if somebody falls.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.147
- Are you good?
- You good?

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:43.249
I'm alive.

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:45.517
See that right over there?
Boys, come on.

00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:46.752
Come on over here.

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:48.087
Welcome to the ruins.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.022
This is actually sick.

00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:51.290
Dude, why is there just a yellow box?

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:52.091
Yeah, what is this thing?

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:53.092
I'm glad you asked.

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:57.229
I paid some guys with Western Union
$10,000 to move this box up here.

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:58.464
Really?

00:14:58.464 --> 00:14:59.899
Nolan, there's a crowbar in your backpack.

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:02.501
- What do you think's in here?
- Pizza?

00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:03.836
You knew that
we were going to run out of water,

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.504
so you put extra water in this box.

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:06.472
And while we're opening this.

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:07.506
There's never been a better time

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:09.308
to download
or sign up for Western Union.

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:11.210
Your first transaction is free.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.279
Just go to westernunion.com/mrbeast.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.848
I know I could have filled this crate
with extra water and food,

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:18.017
but instead I brought something
even better.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.752
Mack, does this moment
remind you of something?

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.688
 Hold this picture of you losing 800 grand.

00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:24.657
 Now here's a picture of you
losing 700 grand.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.258
Bro, why?

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:28.327
- Why go through all…
- You'll see it, one second, don't worry.

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:31.931
Now, I didn't do this to make
fun of Mack for losing $1.5 million.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.233
Really? Because that's exactly
what it feels like you're doing.

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:35.801
I did this to say,

00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:37.870
that we're going to give you
another chance in one final video.

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:39.838
- No shot.
- But this is your final shot.

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:40.773
You're going to give me a third shot.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.274
- Your final shot.
- I got another shot.

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:43.676
If you look at the last video we did,

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:46.078
every single comment was
bring back Mack, bring back Mack.

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:46.845
I hope you win.

00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:48.814
- That's another shot.
- More important than your shot.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:49.949
There's some ruins over here.

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:50.582
Look at them.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.518
Third shot baby. I'm not going
to let you guys down again.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.887
This building is almost
a century old.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:58.324
Imagine building this 100 years ago
just for a bunch of YouTubers

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:59.458
to explore it.

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.261
This is wicked.

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:03.462
Why is there a cactus up there?

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:05.097
Does the cactus just crawl up there?

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.332
or does someone put the cactus up there?

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.000
The cactus does not crawl up there, Jimmy.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.867
It doesn't have legs.

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:09.868
Oh, my God.

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:11.370
Let's check out
on the other side of the crate.

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:13.806
- There's some more ruins over there.
- This is crazy.

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:17.309
Look how the tree is like wrap
around the freaking rocks.

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.511
Would the gang say
this was worth the effort?

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.146
Because I got a third chance,
yes I would.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.481
All right, well he's biased.

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:23.582
Would you two say it was worth it?

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:25.517
- No.
- There was no pizza in the box, so no.

00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:28.854
By this time day five sun
was setting on the island.

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:30.956
And on our way back to camp,
we stopped

00:16:30.956 --> 00:16:32.992
at the peak of the mountain
to take it all in.

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:34.026
There's no one.

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:37.096
I'd rather scaled the side
of a random mountain with than you guys.

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:37.896
Thank you.

00:16:37.896 --> 00:16:39.098
Maybe Dwayne, the Rock, Johnson.

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:39.732
That's fair.

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:40.966
But outside of that,
nobody.

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.234
Boys, I'm going to be honest,

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:44.470
- I'm going to remember this forever.
- Me too.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.472
I think this view made the journey
worth it.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:47.639
Camp's cleaned up.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:51.243
It's been reinforced from the rain,
coconut water, meals ready to go.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.345
Got a lot more water.
It's getting really dark.

00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:55.447
I mean, you can't even see
into the woods right now.

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.883
I don't know how they're going to make it
back from the top of that mountain

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.618
to all these woods in the dark.

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:02.221
This is way sketchier at night

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:04.890
Cactus.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.859
- You good?
- Just a thorn on my side.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:07.826
But little did we know

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:09.962
running into a cactus
in the middle of the night

00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:11.964
was actually
the least of our worries.

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:13.899
We ended up hitting a dead end,

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:17.036
which is a little intimidating
in the middle of a forest.

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:17.870
Which direction is it?

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.104
Is it this way or
that way?

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:20.606
Wait, I can see three different things.

00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:21.673
Dude, there's this right here

00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:22.408
And then there's this one right here.

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:23.342
This is a path too.

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:25.144
Are you sure?

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:28.380
- Or is that it?
- It's definitely not to... Follow me.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.015
Guys, I will pick a random direction.

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:30.682
Wait. No, no.

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:31.717
I think it is to the left.

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.085
- Oh, it is?
- No, it's right over here.

00:17:33.285 --> 00:17:34.119
Oh, it's raining.

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:36.121
And we must have been extra
lucky that night

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:38.957
because on top of being lost,
it started raining.

00:17:38.957 --> 00:17:40.192
Are you sure this is the right one?

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.193
Jimmy, it's this way.

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:42.928
- Which way are we...?
- I told you we should go left.

00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:43.996
- Wait, Chandler!
- Follow me!

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:45.197
Chandler, how sure are you?

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:47.966
- I'm 10% sure it's this way.
- So wouldn't 90% be better?

00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:49.501
Are you 90%?

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:50.369
Can we choose?

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:52.071
It's pouring on the side
of a mountain.

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:52.638
Go.

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:53.405
It's raining.

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:53.739
Okay.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.641
Why do we choose it then unchoose?

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:57.910
Oh, boys, this is bad.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.344
It is getting slick.

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:01.380
I really don't think we came up
something this steep.

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.315
I almost face planted.

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:06.685
And if we couldn't be any more
unlucky on top of it raining

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:07.553
while we're lost,

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:09.555
We've even got a third thing
to worry about.

00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:11.990
Above you
is the most dangerous tree on earth.

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:15.327
If it rains, it will seep poison
that will burn your skin.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.230
Watch out for the death apple sap
because it just rained.

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.466
- What are we supposed to do?
- Not let the poison drip on you?

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:23.635
Oh, that is 10,000%
of death apple tree boys

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:24.503
That means we're close.

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:26.772
And regardless of
if we took the right path or not,

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:28.807
we could tell
we were getting close to camp.

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:30.409
- That's sand.
- That's some sand.

00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:31.777
- Thank God.
- We made it?

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:32.578
Camp is right there.

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:34.513
We have a rare opportunity to scare
Shawn.

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:35.881
Are we going to take advantage
of that?

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:36.882
- Yes.
- Of course.

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:37.549
Okay.

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:46.992
Oh, God.

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:48.427
Oh, my God. You scared me.

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:49.628
- We made it.
- Yeah, we're back.

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:51.330
I made you guys
dinner and coconut water.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.564
Oh, I appreciate it.

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:53.565
Cheers, boys.

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:55.734
Wow, it tastes like a coconut.

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:57.503
After the hike,

00:18:57.503 --> 00:19:00.639
we ate, we showers,
and when we dried off,

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:03.242
we took a second
to look up at the stars.

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.011
Because when you're
in the middle of the ocean,

00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:08.447
it really feels like
you're on another planet.

00:19:12.217 --> 00:19:15.420
But unexpectedly, around the corner

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.123
was something we've been fearing
this entire challenge.

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:20.492
You feel that?

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:21.727
Guys, bad news.

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:23.929
There's a ton of water
on the top of our shelter.

00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:25.964
I just don't know if that's going
to be safe for us to be under it.

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:28.767
Despite our efforts from earlier
to make the shelter better,

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:31.937
water was beginning to pool up
on our roof from the storm.

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:34.273
All this water on top of us,

00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:36.642
is there a world that
could bring our structure down?

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:39.711
And even though all we wanted at
this point was a night of sleep,

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:41.413
we had to get up and deal with it.

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:45.350
Oh, my God, we're absolutely screwed.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:49.087
I'm just getting destroyed
and pummeled by rain all night.

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:54.126
And after 2 hours of rain,
a damage shelter and soaking wet beds

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:57.062
there is no chance any of us
we're going to sleep that night.

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:58.830
Raining on you at night,

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.133
the worst experience
you can have on these challenges.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.968
I'm so tired.

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.736
Hopefully it just passes over.

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:09.374
And even though this was an all time low,
our only option was to wait this thing out.

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:13.111
I'm not going to lie.

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:15.347
The rain
last night was pretty brutal.

00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:16.915
I don't know that I've ever been
that cold

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.051
ever.

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:20.485
What do you want
to do today, Nolan?

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:21.486
I don't know.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.021
Absolutely nothing.

00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:24.723
I just can't wait to get out of here.

00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:25.891
This place sucks a lot.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:26.758
I'm not going to lie.

00:20:26.758 --> 00:20:28.994
I'm sick and I'm tired,

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:29.928
and I want to go
home.

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:32.664
at this point, the island was
making us miserable.

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:35.434
This is quickly turning
into a little bit of a nightmare.

00:20:35.434 --> 00:20:37.569
And after six days
of physical struggle,

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:40.272
our mental health
was beginning to suffer as well.

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:42.174
There's only so much bagged food

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:44.376
you can drink and
hours you can lay in the sun

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.479
before
you start to just feel terrible.

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:48.647
And I'm starting to feel terrible.

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:50.449
I have a headache.
I am very tired.

00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:51.183
It was clear

00:20:51.183 --> 00:20:53.619
that we were going
to have to take drastic measures

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:55.420
if we were going to complete
this challenge.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.688
Looking for a peach cobbler.

00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:58.190
Wanna look for a peach cobbler?

00:20:58.423 --> 00:20:59.124
Oh, I found one.

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:01.159
So, in an effort to turn things around,

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:03.762
we treated ourselves
to canned cobbler for breakfast.

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:04.363
Pretty good.

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:05.130
How about it?

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:06.265
For a can

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:08.600
And with the help of this unorthodox
breakfast.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.234
Chandler happy.

00:21:09.234 --> 00:21:11.403
We were beginning to return back
to normal.

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:12.170
Nolan.

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:15.040
Dude, you hit straight into the tree.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.744
And it became clear how exactly
we were going to survive day six.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.612
By having fun with each other.

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.715
And I began to realize...

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.185
even though we've all done
a lot of suffering.

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.755
Why'd we pick the heaviest seat
in existence?

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:32.124
This whole trip has been filled
with a lot of fun.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:32.858
Cheers boys.

00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:33.625
And adventure.

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:34.860
We did it.

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:37.095
Moments like these are hard to find.

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:39.731
And when I look back
on this challenge,

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:41.933
we probably won't remember
the bad times

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:44.503
as much as we will the good.

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:46.638
It's kind of cool.

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:52.010
And with day six of our challenge
finally coming to an end.

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:56.081
We're celebrating our final
night with a massive fire

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:58.950
but it's kind of burning us all.

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.752
- Yeah, I'm getting back.
- It's a little too big.

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:04.556
When we wake up tomorrow,
the challenge will be over.

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:06.458
And as the sun rose on day
seven.

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:07.292
Go, get me out of here.

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:10.095
We broke down camp
and cleaned up with one thing in mind.

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:13.598
Leaving this place
and never coming back.

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:16.501
And before we leave,
I just want to take the time to say

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:18.337
thank you all for watching.

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:21.406
All of you are the only reason videos
like this exist,

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.809
and I really hope you all enjoyed it.
