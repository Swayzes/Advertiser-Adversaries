um but I guess the only real advice that
 

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.469 align:start position:0%
um but I guess the only real advice that
actually<00:08:19.639><c> makes</c><00:08:20.000><c> sense</c><00:08:20.400><c> and</c><00:08:20.560><c> I'm</c><00:08:21.479><c> not</c><00:08:21.919><c> good</c><00:08:22.080><c> at</c>

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
actually makes sense and I'm not good at

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
giving advice to these ogs but um I
 

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.749 align:start position:0%

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
