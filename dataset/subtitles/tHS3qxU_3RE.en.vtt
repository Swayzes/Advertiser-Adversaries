00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.239
(shapes boinging)

00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:02.255
(electrical whizzing)

00:00:02.255 --> 00:00:03.450
(switch clicking)

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.380
- New intro.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.310
And there's new tech coming.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.330
I mean, there's always new tech coming,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.400
but what better time to lay it all out

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.540
than the beginning of the year

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.360
for some of the best stuff
we're expecting for 2024?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.250
Now, there was plenty
of great tech in 2023:

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.190
From smartphones to cameras to VR stuff

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.220
to computers and headphones,
a bunch of good EVs,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.440
and a bunch of even better EV promises.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.090
But 2024 is looking up.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.800
So these are, to me,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.260
the most interesting
new bits of tech stuff

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.420
that we can look forward
to for this upcoming year.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.710
Actually, right at the
beginning of every year

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.890
is CES in January, where
it's out in Las Vegas.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.260
This year, again, I will
not be there in person,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.550
but I will have my eyes on it,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.680
and I will be seeing if
there's anything interesting

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.500
that sort of bubbles up
above the rest of the noise.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.400
I can always count on you guys

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.830
to send me that stuff on
Twitter if you see anything.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.990
But then also, typically kicking
off every year with a bang

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.060
is a January Samsung event.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.440
So we're expecting S24
reveal stuff pretty soon.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.670
Also, based on the leaks,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.590
it looks like S24 family is
gonna look very similar to S23.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.610
So it'll be curious to see what stuff

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.510
they actually do change.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.610
But that's another January thing.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.720
We're about to get that soon.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.760
But the big headliner that appears to be

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.900
right around the corner, it
feels like, is Apple Vision Pro.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.100
This feels like maybe the most
unprecedented Apple launch

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.700
in a long time, certainly
in my career online.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.680
Just because, you know,
love 'em, hate 'em,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.810
Apple is one of the biggest
tech companies in the world,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.510
and them doing such a
weird launch like this

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.340
is pretty fascinating.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.900
So they've shown it on stage,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.220
they did that announcement video.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.740
And they announced it
months ahead of time,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.980
but they have not shown
a single Apple employee

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.010
or executive wearing it even once.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.050
And they've let people
actually test this thing out,

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.340
including myself many times,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.886
but nobody has been
allowed to film themself

00:01:46.886 --> 00:01:48.720
using it at all.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.553
And just in general,

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:51.090
there's still a lot of
unanswered questions

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.980
about how it's going to work,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.540
what it's going to be really good at,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.700
what you're going to want to use it for.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.650
Are you going to have to
go into an Apple store

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.940
to get custom fit

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.740
to actually be able to
buy one of these things?

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.530
It's just shaping up to be
one of the most interesting

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.080
new products in a long time.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.490
Now, it's super expensive.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.560
We all know that. 3,500 bucks.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.510
So it's, for sure, not for everyone.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.030
Most people I know don't
even plan on getting one,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.220
but it is for those early adopters

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.050
who are curious about the VR stuff.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.120
And those who do,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.120
I already know will be very
impressed by the pass-through,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.230
which is incredible.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.110
By the immersion and the
resolution, which is really good.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.380
By the eye tracking, which
is borderline magical.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.630
But also, it feels like it's
going to be hard to review

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.580
because it doesn't really compete against

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.440
any of the other VR headsets.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.260
Like, it is much more expensive
than any of the others.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.570
So it doesn't compete against them,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.910
but then also, it feels
like, okay, that means

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.610
it has no competition,
which is kind of weird, too.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.350
It's just, it's fascinating.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.310
I will say if you wanna go back

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.750
and watch my initial impressions

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.760
after I first tried Apple Vision Pro

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.490
the day it got announced, I
will link that video below.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.840
That's one thing, you know,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.460
I think this headset is going to be

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.590
technically impressive to
the people that try it.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.780
But the other half of the story
that's completely unwritten

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.000
is, what apps are gonna come out for it?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.650
What are the killer features

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.930
and the use cases going to turn out to be

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.960
that it turns out Apple
Vision Pro is really good at?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.360
I had his vision of, like,
wearing it on the airplane

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.193
and watching a movie,

00:03:16.193 --> 00:03:18.900
wearing the headset
for a four-hour flight,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.890
but it's also so heavy,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.750
that I don't know if I'd
wanna wear it for that long?

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.000
And will the battery
actually last that long?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.400
There's so many questions,
not a lot of answers yet,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.440
so looking forward to that for this year.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.780
But you know what I have
almost no doubt about?

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.020
I'm calling it now, remember
the word "multimodal."

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.940
Just for 2024,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.690
this is going to be the
year of multimodal AI.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.430
See, we've seen so much of the focus on AI

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.050
for these past couple years.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.420
Or, the past two years or so,
it feels like a long time.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.210
But it's mainly just been
these chatbots, right?

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.040
Where they're trained
on all this information,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.480
and then you give it a text prompt,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.800
and it gives you a text answer.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.950
So it could generate, you know,
some new interesting prompts

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.540
or it can summarize something for you

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.790
or it can sort of spit
out something creative.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.620
But it's text in, text out.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.620
But we are right now at the
beginning of starting to see

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.920
what's called multimodal AI,
which all that really means

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.380
is it's more than one
different type of medium

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.720
input into this AI system.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.800
So it'll be able to
understand text or audio

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.320
or images or video

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.110
and be able to work with that
and still give you an output.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.450
So Google got in trouble
a couple of days ago

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.650
because they faked a video.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.060
And it's still on their YouTube channel.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.980
It's a six-minute video of them

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.850
asking their new multimodal
Gemini Ultra AI model

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.410
a bunch of different questions in a row

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.920
about, you know, stuff it
sees being put on a table,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.150
drawings.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.490
You know, this guy puts objects
in the frame, et cetera,

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.101
and it's very conversational
about all this stuff.

00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:46.800
(cups scraping)

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.350
- [Gemini] The cup to the left.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.820
- [Demonstrator] Nice!

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.810
- So that was fake.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.640
Or, at least, heavily edited.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.100
But I honestly didn't really care.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.680
The idea, to me, of it
actually being that advanced,

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.640
it never crossed my mind

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.350
that that could be actually realtime.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.270
But the idea,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.430
the idea of being able to feed

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.790
your virtual assistant anything,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.310
that, to me, is the leveling up of this AI

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.390
that we've been hoping for.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.460
Just being able to give it
whatever's in front of you.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.100
Just be able to show it
something or type out text

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.720
or read it something or whatever,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.185
and all of that still works?

00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:23.460
I'm excited for eventually having

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.770
a multimodal Google Assistant,
whenever that happens.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.150
I also even did a Short recently

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.700
about the Meta AI smart glasses.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.870
They have a camera on the front,

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.460
but they also have an AI model

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.200
in the glasses themselves,
in the computer.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.380
And that AI model is now,
in an early access program,

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.530
multimodal, and so you can
look at stuff with the glasses,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.090
and it'll be able to help you with it.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.570
Look, all I'm saying is multimodal AI.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.610
Just remember that word for now.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.140
And that's not even counting
all the rest of the stuff

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.790
AI is genuinely useful for

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.290
that's not even consumer-facing,

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.040
from finding patterns in
immense amounts of data

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.670
to be able to better predict
and control wildfires

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.050
or to be able to invent new
materials or cure diseases.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.250
What a world we live in.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.410
- We truly live in an age of wonders.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.300
- Now, new hardware is always fun, right?

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.650
You know, new phones, new tablets,

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.150
new computers, all that stuff.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.410
You wanna know something
interesting, though,

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.090
about last year?

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.923
Not a single new iPad
was released in 2023.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.983
Makes you think.

00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:23.250
Now, the thing about the iPad

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.280
is Apple does tend to
make a couple occasional,

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.040
like, amazing hardware
changes to the iPad Pro.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.540
I think the iPad Pro is genuinely one

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.240
of the most impressive
pieces of hardware tech

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.950
that I've ever used.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.540
And then they do that every year or two,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.490
but then at the end of the day you use it,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.530
and it's still an iPad.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.730
So I say this with some hesitation,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.710
but I am actually really looking forward

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.370
to seeing the rumored new OLED iPad Pro

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.203
in 2024.

00:06:48.203 --> 00:06:50.520
That's something we've heard
that we might get for a while.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.860
We already have an OLED S8 Ultra.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.690
That tablet is amazing looking,

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.170
and I wanna see a super bright
OLED display on an iPad.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.550
We'll see if that shows up soon.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.710
But one more interesting design change

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.360
we're actually expecting with Apple,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.490
is actually the Watch 10,

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.950
the Series 10 10th generation Apple Watch.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.210
All signs are pointing towards

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.890
a truly redesigned Apple Watch

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.600
for the first time really ever

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.430
in this year's Apple Watch 10.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.420
Now, I mean, let's be real:

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.090
Apple Watch has looked kind
of the same for a long time.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.590
Yes, the Ultra is a little different.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.810
It's a little bigger, a
little flatter on the front.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.540
But the Series 9 looks
just like a Series 8,

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.750
which looks just like a
Series 7, Series 6, Series 5.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.400
So they're all the same shape,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.070
other than basically the bezel
getting a little bit thinner.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.390
Now, change for the sake of change

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.860
isn't really useful on its face,

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.180
but I just think the Apple Watch

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.730
feels like it actually could
use a fresh coat of paint,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.970
just a little design, a little
refresh to get up to date

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.340
with the Galaxy Watches of the world.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.800
Nice circles. I think it would look nice.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.240
Also, have you heard that the Apple Watch

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.630
is, like, dangerously close
to being banned in the US?

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.060
Which is a whole separate story

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.250
maybe worth a whole separate video.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.083
We'll stay tuned on that.

00:07:57.083 --> 00:07:58.500
Oh, and RCS on the iPhone.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.210
I'm excited for RCS

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.630
to finally come to the
iPhone sometime in 2024.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.880
They haven't said when, but
Apple's committed to it.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.550
I usually don't root for tech to die,

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.820
but I do think it's time to
be done with SMS forever.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.710
So, welcome on board.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.790
Now, this one's more general,

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.030
but I am actually hoping this year

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.510
for some actually interesting smartphones.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.410
I'll put it that way.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.540
Because obviously,

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.730
this is probably a
little bit of a crazy ask

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.200
because smartphones are clearly mature,

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.670
and they all are kind of looking the same,

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.393
and they improve a little bit every year.

00:08:31.393 --> 00:08:33.870
Even the folding ones now

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.750
are kind of looking the same
as they did the year before.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.620
But I think this is a good ripe time

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.440
for a new, maybe mid-range.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.180
It's not gonna be the
flagship, the big hitters,

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.980
but maybe a mid-range smartphone

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.810
to really try something crazy new.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.720
It might be a crazy risky
thing, might not happen,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.250
but I'm hoping that we do get

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.720
to see something like that in 2024.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.010
And then, also, I've said this before,

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.640
but every single year for
the next probably 15 years

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.230
is going to be the most interesting year

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.940
for electric cars yet,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.550
and I don't think 2024 is
any exception to that rule.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.400
And, you know, we've got a
bunch of really solid EVs

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.110
already out there in the world, right?

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.230
The most popular new car
in the world is an EV,

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.360
and there's already some really
good ones in North America.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.970
Also, the NACS port has very quickly

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.410
gotten a ton of commitments

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.660
from pretty much everyone
making electric cars.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.100
So basically, Tesla Superchargers

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.770
will be available to
way more electric cars.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.240
Great.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.220
Now, this year coming up, we already have

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.800
Tesla Cybertrucks starting
to hit the streets.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.760
That's pretty crazy.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.830
We are also definitely expecting a Model 3

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.280
and Model Y refresh very soon, imminently.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.080
I mean, the Model 3 refresh
is already out there.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.670
It's shipping in Europe and Asia,

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.710
and I think it'll be
in the US pretty soon.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.390
Now, stay tuned to the Auto Focus channel

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.470
for a look at those.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.560
We also just got a crazy
Porsche Taycan refresh

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.510
drop a crazy Nurburgring lap time.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.690
So that looks to be a
competitor to the Model S Plaid

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.710
at the very high end.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.300
But also there should be way more

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.280
hopefully more affordable EVs

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.930
coming out over the next couple of years.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.860
So all of this,

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.990
plus some hybrids that
are somewhere in between

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.310
for people not ready to go fully electric,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.500
that should all be the
most interesting year yet

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.580
for Auto Focus stuff.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.200
So I'm excited for that.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.460
And then, of course,
there's lots of other tech

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.760
that I am hoping to see take
strides forward this year.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.210
But also, I wanted to cap this
off with some of the videos

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.870
that I'm most looking
forward to here this year.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.660
So last year, there were 70-plus
new videos on this channel,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.950
which were super fun.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.590
And I have this, like, threshold

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.620
for what I consider
like a certified banger.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.300
Like, when a video...

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.240
When people approached me in real life

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.800
mentioning one of these videos,

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.930
there were a couple that
really bubbled to the top,

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.470
and those were the Tesla Solar Roof video.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.780
The Tesla Cybertruck, actually.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.090
Apple Vision Pro, for sure.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.220
And the Formula 1 explain video.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.120
Those all popped off.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.310
I really enjoyed the Formula
1 explain video, though,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.520
because obviously, that sport
is incredibly high-tech.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.510
But I also think, low-key,
there is a lot of other tech

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.210
in a lot of other sports
that's worth highlighting

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.250
that I think would be super
fun to make videos about.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.770
Now, some of it is in the sport itself.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.470
Some of it is in the
training for the sport,

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.580
you might be surprised by.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.990
Some of it is in the broadcast.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.320
Like, you already know about
those highlight moments.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.080
Tennis match, you see the
ball, the slow-mo camera,

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.700
and it hits just, like, on the line,

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.410
and you get that replay instantly.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.360
The line of scrimmage in football.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.180
The pitch count and the
strike zone in baseball.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.350
There's tons of stuff like that.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.800
My point is I'm probably making
sports tech videos in 2024

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.630
because I've had a lot of fun with those,

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.190
and I happen to be very
interested in that.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.040
But then I also wanna do more
collaborations in general.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.320
I've had a lot of fun with
the "Waveform" podcast.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.120
Which if you haven't
already subscribed there,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.070
link below, get subscribed.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.750
But we have guests on there all the time,

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.620
which are really fun.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.330
And it highlights how much you can learn

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.680
from having conversations with people.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.740
I think my creator conversations
are some of my favorites.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.210
But also, just in general

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.460
collaborations with people on YouTube.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.170
So if y'all have suggestions for people,

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.320
for channels you'd like to
see us collaborate with,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.520
definitely leave a comment below

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.770
because that's on the high list for me.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.450
And then, there's a few

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.340
top-secret projects we've been working on

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.140
over here for a while

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.380
that are finally going to launch in 2024.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.700
You'll know 'em when you see 'em.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.990
There'll be huge announcements.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.850
Stay tuned here, on Twitter,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.310
and everywhere else for that stuff.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.437
I've included Easter eggs
to the two biggest ones

00:12:23.437 --> 00:12:25.020
in this video.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.230
They're subtle, but once
they're announced, you'll know.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.450
So, yeah, look forward to all that stuff

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.440
for the new calendar year.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.273
I'm gonna wrap it up here.

00:12:32.273 --> 00:12:33.690
Thanks for watching.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.220
See you in 2024.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.663
Like, starting now.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.333
Peace.
