00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.054
I'm going to attempt

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.237
to spend the next seven days
in solitary confinement.

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:06.006
- Seal me up.
- Bye Jimmy.

00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:07.884
Hopefully I don't go insane.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:10.276
For the next seven days.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.878
I have to survive in this soundproof

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:15.148
white room with zero human contact
and zero stimulation.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.717
And because this is actually
psychologically dangerous,

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:20.020
the most important thing
is the doctor outside

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.388
making sure I don't go insane.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.592
I worked in psych hospitals for 23
years, and this is much worse than anything

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.259
I've ever seen.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.495
Anything past 50 hours
in a white room like this.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.397
Can lead to permanent
psychological damage.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.932
And I'm about to do 168 hours.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.935
There is a chance that
I actually start to lose my mind

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.171
and go into something
called psychosis.

00:00:39.742 --> 00:00:42.042
And they have to pull me out
because it can cause permanent

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:42.976
damage to me.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.711
He survived
seven days, buried alive.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.379
- Is this much harder?
- Much harder.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.747
He doesn't have social contact.

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:48.681
If your brain doesn't

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.751
have information coming
in, it generates craziness.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.320
It generates hallucinations, it
generates paranoia.

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:57.990
And all I have to survive for
the next week is a bed to sleep on,

00:00:58.023 --> 00:01:00.827
a notebook with a pen,
a refillable bottle, water,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.096
toothbrush with toothpaste
and a bar of soap,

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.865
a toilet to use the bathroom
and a sink for water.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.068
At this point, it was clear to me
it was going to be difficult

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.969
to entertain myself
during this challenge.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.572
Especially on hour nine
when I did this.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.241
You're probably wondering
how many tiles are on these walls.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.277
The correct answer is 1900.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:21.614
And if you want the roof and floor
included, then it's 2860.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.349
But more importantly
than all of that,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.885
according to my stomach,
it is time to eat food.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.088
So if you're wondering how I'm
eating during this challenge.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:31.558
There's a conveyor belt here
which spans over 100 feet

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:34.060
so I can be fed
without any human interaction.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.896
I think I've been in here around
14 hours.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.300
Isn't it crazy that at this point
I was already off by 2 hours?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.870
And so far the hardest part of the
challenge is no one's fed me yet.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.538
In hindsight,
I should've ate more food.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:46.873
Before I came in here.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:49.742
Yeah, it would be really nice if
someone fed me sometime soon.

00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:51.353
Your boy is very hungry.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.515
- Did you wash your hands? 
- Yeah, of course I did.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:56.316
Oh, he did not.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.817
We'll be sending him
his meals randomly

00:01:57.817 --> 00:01:59.252
so he can't guess the time.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.602
Like it's 6 p.m. right now,

00:02:00.627 --> 00:02:02.322
and we're sending him his breakfast.

00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:05.697
When are my friends
going to feed me?

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.961
I am hungry.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.795
I am hungry.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.197
Now because this room is soundproof.

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:13.233
Even though the food arrived,
I didn't realize it

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.756
until I checked 2 hours later.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.094
Too hungry to walk.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.238
That's a little dramatic man, 
come on.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:19.739
So when I finally checked.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.075
Oh, I was not actually expecting
food.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.510
This tastes awesome.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.513
It's cold and soggy, and I'm
just so deprived of feeling things.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:27.964
This is great.

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.852
This solitary confinement set is
literally wrapped in metal chains.

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.120
If this set caught on fire.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.556
I would probably burn alive
before they can unlock it.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.559
Anyways, I'm going to think about
other things than that.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.294
For the next few hours.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:44.230
I try to keep myself as stimulated
as humanly possible.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.332
Wow, that's kind of cool.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.601
He's got nothing.
He has nothing to work with.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:51.471
If he's already resulting to this
for basic stimulation,

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.506
I have my doubts that he'll last
seven days.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.893
It's interesting how when you 
take everything away from a man,

00:02:55.918 --> 00:02:57.510
something as simple as a metal plate

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.279
can be like as fun as an iPhone.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.249
He's going
to get agitated by way of boredom.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.885
This is a very dehumanizing
experience.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.520
I'm just going to go to bed
and we'll see what happens.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:15.137
I think I'm around 40 hours
into the challenge.

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:17.737
Jimmy's 6 hours off on what time
he thinks it is.

00:03:17.762 --> 00:03:19.232
Which means it's around 4 p.m.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:20.266
on day number two.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.935
I thought he'd be on track today.

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:24.003
Losing my sense of time
led to other problems.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.934
No matter what I do,
I literally just can't sleep.

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.711
These lights are just really messing
with my brain.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.482
Maybe I'll just lay here
for the next five days.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.085
The reason he has insomnia is
he doesn't need to sleep.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.121
He wants to sleep this off
and just get it over with.

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.924
But what he should be doing
is trying to do something

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:47.193
that is going to occupy
his attention while he's awake.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.328
He's climbing the wall.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.463
It's the natural human urge
for freedom.

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:52.265
He's regressing to primal instinct.

00:03:52.297 --> 00:03:53.707
Why did I think it was 4pm?

00:03:55.197 --> 00:03:57.076
Shouldn't that mean it's 9pm?

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.871
And by the time I had gotten around

00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:01.666
to eating my first meal,
it was 4:30 in the afternoon.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.059
Don't get me wrong, the food looks
good, but it is freezing cold.

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:09.177
I'd rather starved and
eat the rest of this.

00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:10.302
So...

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:12.919
And when my second meal had arrived,

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.988
I felt like only minutes had passed.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.156
What just came through the conveyor
belt?

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.625
Wait. How long has it been?

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.627
Am I supposed to eat both or...

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:23.463
It definitely was day two
when I got the second breakfast,

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.698
but I didn't eat much of the
breakfast, so maybe they felt bad

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:27.267
because I didn't
eat much of the breakfast.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.013
Well, no...

00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:29.936
At this point, I had no idea how long

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.205
that first meal was sitting
in the conveyor belt for.

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:33.973
Did you see he's getting a little paranoid?

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:36.409
That's the thing that can get worse
as time goes on.

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.944
It's only day two.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.646
I'm not sure what to do.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.414
I think I'm going to just see
how high I can count.

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.650
One, two, three, four.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:45.179
It looks crazy, right?

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:46.947
565, 566, 567

00:04:46.972 --> 00:04:49.756
When you're in a situation
where there's nothing to do

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.491
999.

00:04:51.515 --> 00:04:53.793
What's crazy is to just succumb to it.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.328
1,000.

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:58.593
As this progresses, he's going
to run out of random things to do.

00:04:58.617 --> 00:05:00.633
And I got to give it to him.
The doctor was right.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:03.603
Because later in this challenge
I borderline go insane.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:05.638
Do you think I'd get it?

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:06.956
Do you think I'd?

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.994
And while my strategy to sleep
through most of the challenge

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:31.282
did help pass the time, it ended up
hurting me in other ways.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.603
I see food over there.

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:40.106
It's freakin soggy and cold.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.674
How long has this been sitting here?

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.856
This food's been sitting there
for 7 hours.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.113
I would have given anything to eat
that ice cream.

00:05:47.956 --> 00:05:50.358
It would have been nice
to have edible parts of the meal.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.552
Well,
I guess I'll just be hungry again.

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:56.055
Normally, because we're working on
so many videos at once,

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.990
I'm usually, like, incredibly stressed.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.359
As of right now,

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.662
I don't really feel that stressed
at all, but I feel a ton of anxiety

00:06:02.837 --> 00:06:06.641
because I have this severe FOMO
that I'm missing tons of cool stuff

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:07.567
going on in the world.

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:08.368
It's weird.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.104
It's a different emotion
than I'm used to.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:16.058
It's pretty crazy
how hard it is to do nothing.

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:18.138
I'm starting to get really bored

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.521
This is getting very hard on me
mentally.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:21.888
I'm bored.

00:06:22.138 --> 00:06:22.895
Help.

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.319
I was nowhere near the 168
hour mark,

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.962
so by hour 65,
I started to wonder.

00:06:28.986 --> 00:06:30.123
How do you do a handstand?

00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.207
I wish before I came in here,

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:43.044
I had someone teach me the basics
of how to do a handstand.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.073
He's going to have to invent
concepts that only exist in his mind

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:49.942
to keep himself from experiencing
intense depression.

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:52.780
I'm just going to envision
that I'm currently walking in a park.

00:06:53.493 --> 00:06:56.633
There's green grass, 
someone's fishing.

00:06:56.844 --> 00:06:59.407
He's literally making up scenarios
in his head right now.

00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:00.100
Oh my God.

00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:01.921
All in all, it's very sunny.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.438
I hear birds.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.321
You've ruined my walk in the park.

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:07.536
Oh my God.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.883
We're watching him slip into madness.

00:07:12.094 --> 00:07:13.466
They gave me more food.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:16.978
But it looks like we got some rice,
sweet potato and steak.

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:19.897
This is the best meal I've gotten
so far this challenge.

00:07:19.922 --> 00:07:22.241
If you look right here,
you'll see some rice,

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:25.235
and any ordinary human
would probably eat this rice.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.805
But I'm going to count it
13, 14, 15, 16, 17

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:30.961
97, 98, 99, 100, 101,

00:07:30.986 --> 00:07:33.383
265, 266, 267,

00:07:33.408 --> 00:07:35.438
307, 308, 309, 310,

00:07:35.462 --> 00:07:37.649
421, 422, 423, 424.

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:41.383
445, 446, 447.

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:45.431
There are 447 grains of rice
on this metal tray.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:49.000
This information probably profoundly
changed you as a human.

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:52.171
I'm feeling pretty tired,

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:54.373
which means it's
probably the night of the fifth.

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:55.341
I wasn't even

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:59.297
halfway through the challenge
and was already off a full day.

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:03.524
I'm going to get some more Zs in the
bathroom where it's not so freaking bright,

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:05.518
which proved to be
my smartest move yet

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:09.030
because I actually slept
in that bathroom for 12 hours.

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.624
We're officially halfway
into the challenge.

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:13.539
- 84 hours.
- Jimmy is.

00:08:14.168 --> 00:08:15.960
And we're going to tell that
in his next meal.

00:08:15.985 --> 00:08:17.630
Just kind of mix it all up for him.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.453
I mean, he could still
put the letters together.

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:21.501
I am hungy.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:22.668
Hungy I am.

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:24.370
What are we working with here?

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.403
What is this?

00:08:25.427 --> 00:08:26.672
Bro's never heard
of SpaghettiOs?

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.875
And that wasn't the only thing
I was forgetting the name of.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.072
What is this called?

00:08:30.723 --> 00:08:31.766
This is a...

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:35.014
...a roll.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.216
This is a lot of sauce for one roll.

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:38.651
Kind of tastes like ketchup.

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.186
How does he not notice
the letters in there?

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.094
That's an N.

00:08:42.134 --> 00:08:43.321
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:45.610
You guys forgot to take these
four SpaghettiOs out.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.429
No!

00:08:46.453 --> 00:08:48.430
Every time he finds a letter,
he just keeps eating it.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.032
I hope those weren't
supposed to spell something.

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:56.444
That I was magically supposed
to realize that before I ate them

00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:59.461
and then put it together
to figure out a word for more food.

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:02.608
Surely that's not what they wanted
for me.

00:09:02.633 --> 00:09:06.119
Jimmy's about to watch this when
he gets out and feel so dumb.

00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:07.256
Depression.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.757
At this point, the bright lights
were really starting to get me.

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:15.388
I have a ginormous headache right now,
and I am so hungry.

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.156
What is going on to my body?

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:19.055
Well, he did ask for more food
even though

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.793
he is getting all the calories he needs.

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:23.029
But the reason for that
is that he's so under stimulated,

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:24.030
he thinks he's starving.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.634
I ended up checking for food
over and over and over again.

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:30.403
This is oddly soothing.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.110
Do you think I'd get a concussion
from doing this?

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.174
You should probably stop.
You're right.

00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:36.664
I should probably stop.

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:41.080
There's a bag of McDonald's here.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.949
It's suspiciously light.

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:46.461
If there is not McDonald's in this
bag, I'm going to be depressed.

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:48.387
There actually is.

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.689
Let's go.

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:53.993
Every time I get a meal, it's like
20 minutes of just pure happiness.

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:55.528
I feel human again.

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:57.496
I can't stop smiling.

00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:58.431
I'm so happy.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.399
And then the second I finish it,

00:10:00.424 --> 00:10:03.752
I feel a wave of depression
because I'm like, What do I do now?

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:07.807
The seconds are starting
to blend together, so much.

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:11.177
I would try to guess what time
it is, but I have no earthly idea.

00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:15.114
My mind is slowly deforming
into stupidity.

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.983
I need to occupy myself better.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:19.352
We're going to grab this McDonald's
cheeseburger wrapper,

00:10:19.428 --> 00:10:22.029
as well as this cup
that was holding my toothbrush.

00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:24.290
And now we have basketball.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:29.161
LeBron, Steph, Kobe,
maybe basketball's not my thing.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.139
I think I was always better
at baseball. They're like,

00:10:31.194 --> 00:10:32.350
Strike!

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.576
That was not what was supposed to happen.

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:36.526
And then I remembered...

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.547
Oh, there's a fork on it.

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:41.787
That I had an indestructible plate
from my very first meal.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.752
I am going to throw this so far,

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.201
it is hilarious.

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:52.284
I'm bored.

00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:55.488
I still have two days left inside
this room and I have a feeling

00:10:55.513 --> 00:10:57.443
at some point
I'm going to want to leave.

00:10:57.553 --> 00:10:58.800
It's day four.

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:01.850
No matter how much 
I beg, or scream, or plead...

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:03.362
Or burp.

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:05.097
Do not let me out of this room
early.

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:06.209
Okay, Jimmy,
I got you.

00:11:06.234 --> 00:11:09.990
My instincts tell me 
I was so far done 113 hours,

00:11:10.015 --> 00:11:12.038
which means
I have 55 hours remaining.

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:13.773
And whoever's editing this,
show them

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:15.474
how many hours
I actually have remaining.

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:17.977
Hopefully
in somewhere close to 55 hours.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.747
I think he's going to get angry
and possibly paranoid about

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:22.648
what's going on.

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:25.626
Is a man not allowed to have privacy?

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:27.687
There's a camera there.
There's a camera above that.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:28.287
There's a camera.

00:11:28.287 --> 00:11:31.090
A camera, a camera, camera,
camera, camera, camera.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.268
There's
so many cameras on me 24/7.

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:36.057
I'm going to go insane.

00:11:36.082 --> 00:11:38.433
What if we throw the camera
through the conveyor...

00:11:38.652 --> 00:11:39.464
Genius.

00:11:39.527 --> 00:11:40.863
I'll treat it like bowling.

00:11:44.816 --> 00:11:46.370
Somehow I hit my finger.

00:11:51.222 --> 00:11:54.620
I severely underestimated
how hard this video would be.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.916
Just thinking about
it has me like tearing up,

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:59.452
but I kind of feel like an animal
right now.

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:02.154
Like, I feel like I lost
all my rights as a human.

00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:05.224
If I had to guess, I would say
I'm halfway through day five.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:09.028
I really miss my girlfriend
and I miss the gang as well.

00:12:09.595 --> 00:12:10.711
Even Nolan.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.665
Even Nolan.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:16.802
Mentally right now I'd say I'm
at like literal rock bottom.

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.938
Like, this is very inhumane.

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:21.240
I've been in here so long
that some of my dreams

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:24.744
are about me in this room, and
I think it's like day six or seven.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.279
But then I wake up
and realize it was a dream.

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:30.282
What time is it?

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:34.153
I would pay so much money 
to know what freaking time it is.

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:37.547
Let's go over why I think there
are 33 hours left in this challenge.

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:40.860
I've slept five times.

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:44.430
Reason number two, 
I usually poop once a day,

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.966
and I've also pooped five times
since I got here.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.268
Reason number three,

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:51.270
I've grown a lot of hair
on my neck here,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.105
and this usually does
take like a week.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.391
If for some reason...

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.644
If for some
reason it's still day five

00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:01.680
Or God forbid, it's somehow
still day four,

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:03.758
I will lose my mind.

00:13:05.359 --> 00:13:07.495
While I was sleeping,
I had a dream about that

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.655
one time that I counted to 100,000.

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:10.523
And so when I woke up,

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:12.958
I decided to do a thousand laps
around this room.

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:15.157
You know, for old times sake.

00:13:15.758 --> 00:13:16.626
That'll be the marker.

00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:18.126
1, 2, 3.

00:13:18.151 --> 00:13:20.232
Watching back this footage,
it's literally crazy.

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.952
I resorted to walking in circles
to keep myself sane.

00:13:22.977 --> 00:13:24.403
A thousand is way too many.

00:13:24.403 --> 00:13:25.771
I'm already starting to get dizzy.

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:27.039
This entire challenge.

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:30.075
I've been getting water out of this
sink and I'm going to be honest.

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.711
this uh… this is… it…

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.381
I'm not... Bro.

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:36.782
Cirkul is a flavor cartridge

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:40.419
you can screw on your water bottle
and makes bland water taste amazing.

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.355
There's over 100 different flavors
that fit this bottle

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:45.658
that are all zero calories
and zero sugar.

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:49.417
Moving this tripod is miserable.

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.931
Choose
how intense you want the flavor

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:54.567
and then start drinking away.

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:57.403
It honestly adds so much flavor
I can't even tell it's sink water.

00:13:57.469 --> 00:14:00.105
I've been drinking fruit punch
throughout this entire challenge

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:02.508
and it actually makes the water
taste amazing.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:05.511
I'm going to walk back and forth
between these walls.

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:08.948
These cartridges also last for
multiple refills of your water bottle,

00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:11.483
which is good because the boys suck
at sending these.

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:14.019
Sometimes I got to use the same one
for a whole day.

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.721
If you want to start
drinking more water

00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:17.523
or just want your water
to start tasting

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.887
good in general,
go to drinkcirkul.com

00:14:19.912 --> 00:14:21.660
or your local
Walmart to give it a try.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.995
I've tried everything

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:25.331
to keep myself entertained
and I'm going to be honest.

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:27.433
It's not working.

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:29.201
And after I finished all my Cirkuls,

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:32.204
Karl brought back to people
from 100 days trapped together.

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:33.229
We're here.

00:14:33.253 --> 00:14:34.940
Hey, check it out. 
You guys are going to love this.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.676
That's the faces of the guy
that trapped you guys for 100 days.

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:40.982
Would you say this is easier or
harder than what you guys did?

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:42.257
In comparison,

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:46.051
I think I'd rather have like
someone else in it with me.

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:49.288
And now that the tables had turned
and I was the one in the white cube,

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:51.557
Bailey
and Suzie plotted their revenge.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.373
I'll show you guys
how the conveyor belt works.

00:14:54.451 --> 00:14:55.732
They sent an empty tray.

00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:57.339
He's about to freak out.

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:58.264
I don't feel bad at all.

00:14:58.264 --> 00:14:59.265
This is what he gets.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.240
I bet every dollar in my bank
account Karl just showed up.

00:15:02.256 --> 00:15:03.879
No way!

00:15:04.123 --> 00:15:05.373
You hungry, Jimmy?

00:15:05.967 --> 00:15:07.148
Eat this!

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:09.308
No, we're not doing this.
We are not doing this.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.417
We're not doing it.

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:12.420
This is the most stimulation
he's had in days.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.721
Well, you got to
give them credit.

00:15:25.745 --> 00:15:27.029
I probably deserve that.

00:15:30.248 --> 00:15:32.670
Imagine this
is what happens after you die.

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:36.232
You just go to a white room
like this forever.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.545
That would be miserable.

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:40.806
When I sleep.

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.841
I dream of me in the outside world.

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:47.561
And when I'm awake, I'm
just depressed and lonely

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:49.615
and to be honest, miserable.

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:54.053
So the more time I spend sleeping,
the happier I am.

00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:56.264
Let me out.

00:15:57.856 --> 00:15:58.873
I'm Batman.

00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:02.528
I feel dead.

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:04.473
I really need to get out of here.

00:16:04.865 --> 00:16:08.334
We did seven days on a raft,
I did seven days buried alive.

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:11.003
And now seven days
and solitary confinement.

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:14.707
If I had known how hard this would
be, I never would have done this.

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:19.286
If that hour number in the top left
says anything higher than 20,

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:20.746
I'm going to lose my mind.

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.948
I am feeling extremely lonely.

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:24.389
I miss my girlfriend.

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:26.552
This is torture.

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:27.486
Is he crying?

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:29.054
He's not doing well.

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:33.092
He's just like napping on the floor,
throwing things, having tantrums,

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:35.427
getting happy when he gets snacks,
he's like a child.

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:37.429
I think there's 8 hours left

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:39.732
and then they're going
to open that door right there.

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:41.342
And I am free.

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:42.601
I hope.

00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:44.403
I pray. Please be 8 hours.

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:47.206
He thinks he's sleeping through
the last couple of hours right now.

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:48.356
That's what he thinks this is.

00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:50.584
So it's going to be a rude
awakening, literally.

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:52.178
To be honest it's concerning.

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:56.548
I give it maybe another 2 to 3 hours
and that door opens.

00:16:56.615 --> 00:16:58.884
I'm going to enjoy my last meal, 
and then we're getting out of here.

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:00.986
- Did he just say it's his last meal?
- I think so.

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:03.295
Well, that's ironic because it's
literally exactly

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:04.466
24 hours.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.092
Any hour now, they're going
to be walking through that door.

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:09.628
So I'm going to clean up
the place. It's a little messy.

00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:13.139
You know, I was trying to make up
an excuse to clean, but in reality,

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:14.633
I'm just bored.

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:17.269
I thought coming into this experiment,
I would get more

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:20.506
mental clarity, maybe
learn a little bit about myself.

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:24.076
But in reality, all I'm walking away
with is the newfound skill

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:26.904
of being able to throw things out
a conveyor belt door.

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:28.914
Or maybe not.

00:17:28.914 --> 00:17:32.351
There is just no world where there's
more than 24 hours left.

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:35.120
I can't do another 24 hours in here.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.623
I've had my limit,
but it doesn't matter.

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:39.458
There's just not 24 hours left.

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:40.392
I just don't.

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:42.194
I refuse to believe that.

00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:45.397
So any second now, any second now,

00:17:45.997 --> 00:17:47.507
any second now.

00:17:47.532 --> 00:17:49.802
To pass the time, 
I'm going to resume counting.

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:52.805
One, two, three, four,

00:17:53.138 --> 00:17:57.104
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:17:57.129 --> 00:17:59.486
10, 11, 12,

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:02.790
13, 14, 15, 16,

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:05.848
20, 21, 22.

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:14.074
5422, 5423, 5424, 5425.

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.605
I swear to God
I heard something out there.

00:18:29.708 --> 00:18:32.611
I'm sad.

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:35.280
I'm sad.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.382
I am sad.

00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:40.377
I am sad.

00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:43.559
I don't want to be here.

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:47.309
Get me out of this room.

00:18:50.394 --> 00:18:53.140
I don't want to be here.

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:54.433
This is barely human.

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:56.768
He's lying in bed, covering his eyes.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:57.736
No excitement.

00:18:57.736 --> 00:18:59.671
This is totally
not what you want to see.

00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.773
How is he going to act? It's
going to be a new human.

00:19:01.773 --> 00:19:03.408
I'm worried he's going to be
this human.

00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:05.744
He's just collapsed
into dysfunction.

00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:08.598
We've never pushed him
as far as he is pushed in this video.

00:19:08.623 --> 00:19:11.750
Well because he's been totally deprived
of any human contact.

00:19:11.783 --> 00:19:14.286
Be gentle, like a little kid
waking up from a nap.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.922
Well, there's 10 minutes left,
so let's go get ready.

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:18.598
- Thank you. 
- Good luck.

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:23.223
I'm going to die.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.270
Ten, nine, eight.

00:19:28.152 --> 00:19:31.934
Seven, six, five, four...

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:35.407
Hold on. 
Wait, I don't even have pants on.

00:19:35.407 --> 00:19:37.269
Three, two, one.

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:39.511
Oh, my gosh.

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:40.112
Hey, Jimmy.

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:41.947
Sorry,
I was just putting my pants on.

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:43.269
It's not as bright out here.

00:19:43.325 --> 00:19:44.058
How is it, dude?

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:45.517
I'm actually kind of lightheaded.

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:47.094
You know, it's crazy, 
but after this challenge

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:49.215
I kind of forgot how to interact
with humans.

00:19:49.473 --> 00:19:50.566
Where he’s going?

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.559
It's actually relieving

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.294
to not stare at a bright light.

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.362
It's like the ceiling is awesome.

00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:00.105
This is the happiest 
I've seen you in a long time.

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.333
Honestly, I thought I was

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:04.535
perpetually
just going to be 24 hours forever.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.771
Follow me outside.

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:07.406
I want to see the sun.

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:09.274
Oh, my God.

00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:10.547
It's dark out.

00:20:10.571 --> 00:20:13.828
So nice to see the
outside world.
