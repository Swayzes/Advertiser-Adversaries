00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.036
Behind me are
the most expensive cars in the world.

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:03.770
No joke.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.074
We got our hands on over $250
million worth of cars,

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:11.444
one of them
even costing $100 million.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:15.615
And we're going to be exploding
sailing, driving

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:20.553
and even flying all of these cars
to show you why they're so expensive.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:24.424
Starting with this $1 car,
literally a rust bucket.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:26.159
Why are you selling this car
for a dollar?

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.995
Well,
you see, it's pretty much worthless.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:30.964
And I can't put any time
or money in this thing.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.833
If you grab this dollar,
the deal is final.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.736
Now, obviously,
this is a piece of garbage,

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:39.939
but when you spend 20 K on repairs,
it actually runs.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.308
All right, let's get this
bad boy started.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.945
I do not think it would start

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.414
How is this thing driving?

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:48.748
It smells like smoke!

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.050
this is crazy.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.884
One dollar car!

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.452
One dollar car!

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.487
- One dollar car!
- One dollar car!

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.790
One dollar car!

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.630
All right, well, that was the $1 car.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:04.664
Glad I wasn't in that.

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:08.034
Bringing the $100,000 car,
which drives itself.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:08.601
No joke.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.171
No one is currently in this car,
and it is moving.

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:12.839
Let's see what 100 grand gets you.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.407
There's a lot of room in this car.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.010
This is one of the few cars
that can actually fit all my kids.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.079
- Do you have kids?
- Yeah, all of them.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.380
Let's take it for a little spin.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.416
The real reason you're buying a Tesla
is because it can drive itself.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:24.884
All right.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.586
I'm no longer driving the car.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.088
Oh, it's switching lanes.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.423
Oh, it is literally driving itself.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:33.226
I'm not touching the gas and I'm
not touching the steering wheel.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.962
Jimmy, are you telling me now
you can take a nap while driving?

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.697
- No, don't do that.
- Oh ok.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:39.933
Now, let's see how fast the car goes.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.603
It jerks you backwards.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.370
That's terrifying.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.572
This is just the beginning.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.640
Later, we have a car
that literally transforms

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.275
into an airplane and flops.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:49.909
But now.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.312
Oh look that lambo.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:53.713
Oh, I almost hit it.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.216
Bro just left the keys in here.
How'd nobody steal it?

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:59.819
Even though this cost twice
as much, and has half as much space.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.989
I don't know if I take 200k
for this car because I don't fit in it.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.924
Did they even know
how to drive a Lamborghini?

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:09.729
- How would you do fourth?
- I think you just click the shifter.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.463
All right.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:12.031
And now we're on the road.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.600
Oh, that sound.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.068
Oh my gosh. She's out there.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.769
Hey, she's got some power.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:17.604
Oh, my gosh.

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.439
This car is insane.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.541
I'm barely touching the gas,
and we're flying.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.710
This might be the fastest car
I've ever driven.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.478
If you need to compensate
for something,

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:26.679
this is definitely the car.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.682
And now we're at the $300,000 car,

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:32.719
and this is supposedly
the safest car on the planet.

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:33.920
It's like a tank.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.622
Is this a military-grade car?

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.023
Yeah. This is so high up.

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:38.625
You were also just in the Lamborghini.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:39.926
True, true perspective.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.061
Let's go over
what makes this car so safe.

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.331
First things first is the bulletproof
windows that are this thick.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.434
The car is also encased
in explosive proof armor

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.270
that we're going to put to the test
later on.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.605
- Karl, do you want to press the button?
- So bad.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.641
- You want to hit the smokescreen button?
- Please?

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:58.711
That is crazy.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.813
We have a literal smokescreen.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:04.117
Oh, my gosh, It smells.

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:05.985
But the best part is
none of these features are

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.187
what makes the car really safe.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.323
It's the little explosive proof
frame around the car.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.192
And we're going to be
the first people to test it.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:15.128
And for reference,
before we blow up the $300,000 car,

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:18.231
we're going to blow up on normal cars
to see if the passengers survive.

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.434
Three, two, one.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.676
Not only is it on fire,
but the mannequins

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.877
literally flew out of the car.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.512
We blew a sunroof
into that thing.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.980
It doesn't handle it well at all.

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:36.749
And before we blow up this car,
I'm going to put feastables inside

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.284
Better protect my freaking chocolate.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:42.255
So supposedly this car is explosion
proof, but that's never been tested.

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:43.523
Let's see if the mannequins

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:46.059
and even more importantly,
the Feastables survive.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:49.062
Three, two, one.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.274
It just jumped.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:04.510
The car survived the blast
with only a few minor scrapes.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.113
It put a dent in the window.
Wait. Hold on, hold on.

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:09.182
Where are the feastables? Chandler,
get out the way.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.217
The feastables survive.

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:13.219
If you're looking for a car
that can take a bomb,

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.721
I officially recommend this one.

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:17.824
But since you're not going to war
anytime soon for only an extra

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:22.862
$200,000, you could get this
$500,000 boat car.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:24.564
On land this is a normal car.

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:27.033
You can't really tell the difference.
But here's the fun part.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.736
Just drive it in the water
and it turns into a boat.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.170
We'll let Karl go first.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.706
- Here we go.
- Oh, this doesn't feel right.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.275
This doesn't feel right.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.477
I'm having them go first
just so I can make sure it works.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.647
Are we sinking, no we are floating!

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.016
Oh, it looks like it
worked. Let's see what happens.

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:45.318
Oh, my God. We're driving in the water.

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.687
Oh, so you press
this until you hear a beep.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:49.722
That's a beep.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:52.425
Now, I should be able to drive this
like a normal car, but on the water.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.360
Thea hold on.

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:57.830
This is incredible.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.768
This was literally a car five seconds ago.

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:03.069
Yeah!

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.139
I would be out there with them,
but I get carsick and boat sick.

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:07.173
Oh, hey there.

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:12.612
 Oh my God.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.114
All right, Karl!

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.383
Karl!

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.989
They should not let me drive this

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:32.799
We got it baby.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.768
Rule number one,
stay really far away from Kris.

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.637
We're driving in circles.

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:41.941
Oh, they're doing donuts
in the water, they're making a whirlpool.

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.243
I just met this guy 5 seconds ago.

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:45.345
We're going to race

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.181
three, two, one. Go!

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.016
He is so much faster.

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:52.018
He's not even trying.
Come on. Faster.

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:54.787
Oh, we're destroying him.

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:57.957
- He's slowing down.
- I can't believe we just beat him.

00:05:58.057 --> 00:05:59.726
This thing goes way too fast.

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:02.228
I can't think of a better way
to celebrate a win than a Feastables Bar.

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.297
Hey, have some feastables.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.233
I got it.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:08.868
Feastables the number one
chocolate on the planet.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.937
If you're not eating it,
you should fix that.

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:14.674
The fact that all three of us are driving
cars on the ocean is insane.

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:16.943
Jimmy, I love this thing so much.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:20.113
The craziest part is this is just
the beginning of this video.

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:22.682
The next car on our list
can literally fly.

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:26.119
And since I'm afraid of heights, I'll
let Karl and Nolan take this one.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.721
Dude, what is happening?

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:32.792
This car is not only completely
street legal, but it also has wings

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.160
that can take it to literally

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.095
8000 feet in the sky.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.964
There's literally a propeller on that car.

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:39.365
Stay here and watch it take off.

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:40.833
I'm going to go
in that plane and follow it.

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:45.037
I just don't believe
this is actually going to fly

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.542
It's taking off!

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:52.111
The wheels aren't on the ground anymore.

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.714
It's literally a car that's flying.

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:57.183
These cars are getting crazier and crazier.

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.118
I can't even believe my eyes.

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:01.554
There is a car
a mile above my head right now.

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:06.392
Oh, this so cool.

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:09.429
I feel like for $600,000,
this is a steal.

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:10.863
Prepare for landing.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.566
Up next is the $1 million car.

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:15.168
But I didn't only bring one up.

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:18.438
As you can imagine, there's
a lot of $1 million cars out there.

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:20.273
So to make sure
I brought your favorite,

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:24.210
we got the ten coolest
$1 million cars.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.014
And as per usual, we have the entire
racetrack to ourselves.

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:30.283
So I let my friends choose
whatever car they want.

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:31.918
I'm going to ride with you.
You pick.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:32.685
Look at this baby.

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:33.886
Am I going to fit in this?

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:35.321
All right.
I'll try not to text and drive.

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:37.824
It's private property.
It's technically legal here.

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:40.159
Oh, here we go.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:46.866
We're never going to die.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:47.934
Don't jinx it.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.202
I feel like I'm in NASCAR.

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:51.771
I'm having so much fun.
This feels like Fast &amp; Furious.

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:56.309
There's just something so masculine
about driving over priced loud cars.

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:57.610
On a private racetrack.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.479
On a private racetrack.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:00.980
Hold on.
I got to send a text.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.483
No, I'm kidding.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.319
- I'm crashing this.
- Please no.

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:07.887
Karl!

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.088
Oh, my God.

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:11.123
We're doing donuts in a million dollar car.

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:15.061
While the gang is whizzing
around the track,

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.562
I want to show you the next car.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:19.832
This $2 million limited edition
hydrogen car.

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:20.366
No joke.

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:23.769
This car is completely powered
by hydrogen and actually exhales

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:26.939
drinkable water as exhaust,
but the car still being developed.

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.608
So this is just a prototype.

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:31.043
I don't think I've ever struggled
this much to get in a car.

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:34.080
All right.
Let's see how she closes.

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:41.654
First impressions, door kind of slow.

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:42.822
We're about to turn on the road.

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:44.490
This is a really big deal
because

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.759
this car has never been driven
on a road before.

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:48.327
Oh, you should have told me before
I got here.

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:50.096
They built this car
as a proof of concept.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:52.598
So driving on the road
is questionable.

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:54.166
Well, look at that lady over there.

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:56.369
That person over
there is literally filming our car.

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:58.304
And while we're driving,
I want to tell you

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.840
about the Samsung Galaxy
Z Flip 5 phone.

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:03.676
And what's special about this phone
is it literally folds in half.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.645
Boom, half the size.

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:07.747
Also, I'd wear a seat belt,
but it doesn't have

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:09.081
they haven't gone that far yet.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:11.250
Folding screen on the flip
five makes the phone

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.385
fit in your pocket better

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.021
and also allows you to use
two apps at the same time.

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:16.255
- Show them.
- Let me show you.

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:17.557
On the bottom half
of the phone,

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.258
I have Google and on the top half

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:21.093
We're watching a MrBeast video.

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:22.495
Oh, snap.

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:24.630
- Bro, this boy gets up there.
- Yeah.

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:28.134
Even though this car uses hydrogen
instead of gas, it still has a range

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:33.039
of over a thousand miles,
top speed of 221 miles per hour.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:37.143
And another cool thing about this
phone is it can record in 4K 60 fps.

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:39.111
You can even record while it's folded.

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:39.779
In fact

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:44.116
The Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra
is the official vlog camera of the channel.

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:45.418
Listen to that engine.

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:47.653
- What?
- That's such a cool sound.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:51.257
It literally has a front facing
camera even when you close it down.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.360
The Flip5 is the most innovative
phone Samsung has ever made.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.462
Click the link in the description
to get one right now.

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:57.029
Do it.

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:58.831
There's a lot of cars around me
and everywhere.

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.933
Get away from my $2 million car.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.101
I'll see you at the next car.

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:06.706
Back at the racetrack, we have
the most exotic and powerful car yet.

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:08.708
Costing $10 million.

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:12.411
This Koenigsegg Vader
is the only one in existence.

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:15.147
So this is the world's
fastest production car.

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.148
Oh, my gosh.

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:19.218
And with literal crushed
diamonds in the paint,

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:21.988
the insurance companies
only let the owner drive.

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:25.925
That's probably the coolest door
I've ever seen in my life.

00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:27.326
You're crazy.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.661
- All right, let's do this.
- Let's do it.

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:30.162
Fun fact, I made
a grown man cry.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:32.164
- Really?
- Yeah. I scared the crap out of him.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:35.167
I'm going to put my head back
so I don't get whiplash.

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:39.839
How was it so fast?

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.142
I've never...

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:44.477
Watch out for that.

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:46.545
The reason this car is one of the fastest

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:49.949
on the planet is because of its twin
turbocharged V8 engine

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:53.853
and the fact that its entire frame
is made out of air core carbon fiber,

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:57.123
making it weigh
almost 500 pounds less than a Lamborghini.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:59.191
I've never witnessed
anything like this before.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.035
It's like riding in a roller coaster.

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.970
My heart is pounding.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.505
Well, that was awesome.
Thank you, sir.

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:13.072
Thank you.

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:14.306
Let's go hang out with Jay Leno

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:16.542
and see what a $20 million car
looks like.

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:18.844
All right.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:22.181
Jay Leno was the king of The Tonight
Show for over 20 years.

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:24.684
Today, he's the proud owner
of one of the most impressive

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:29.422
car collections in the world,
including this $20 million McLaren F1.

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:32.291
Did it just start doing that
because of you?

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.359
It's high tech.

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:34.927
Robbers don't try that.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.696
And what makes it so valuable?

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.698
It's a V12 carbon fiber.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:39.999
It's extremely light.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.334
And it was 241 miles an hour,

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:46.105
which is still the fastest for
a non turbocharged non supercharged car.

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:47.540
I'll show you something kind of cool.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.742
It got three seats,
as you can see.

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:52.178
The car is about 2300 pounds.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.346
Your most modern cars are 4,000.

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:56.515
It's more comparable
to Nolan's mom than another car.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.817
That's right. Exactly.

00:11:57.817 --> 00:12:02.188
In fact, Nolan's mom was really
the one they used as the benchmark.

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:04.790
- You guys want to go for a ride?
- Of course.

00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:07.593
There's no way to get in that middle seat.
 It's actually uncomfortable.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:08.928
Oh, it's not bad.

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:11.864
Yeah, it's not bad.
Did not look bad at all. It's comfortable.

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.539
It's oddly comfortable
to have three seats like this.

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:22.374
Yeah, it is pretty interesting,

00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:24.410
Normally this is where 
the wheel would be.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.511
Or if you were in England.

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:27.213
this is where the steering wheel would be.

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.348
You can be in England,
you can be in America.

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.217
How long have you had this car?

00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:33.285
- What year were you born?
- 1998.

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:34.587
Actually, I got this in 98.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:38.157
I popped out of my mom and he's like,
"let's celebrate by buying this car."

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.125
Here's the second part.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:40.259
I'm your dad.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:43.462
Interesting.

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:44.897
How much did you buy this for?

00:12:44.897 --> 00:12:47.433
I paid 800,000, and I bought it.

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.435
And people thought
you'll never get your money back.

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.537
But then it just went up
and up and up and up.

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:53.372
And now there's $20 million,
you know?

00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:54.507
So it's crazy.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.643
This car basically made you
a millon dollars a year every year.

00:12:57.643 --> 00:12:59.512
I guess that's fair to say.

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.247
Karl, what do you think of the car?

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:04.917
I like it.

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:06.585
What's stopping you from buying one

00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:10.289
$19.9 million?

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:11.390
Have you ever had a wreck?

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.458
Oh, yeah.

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:13.759
I've had a lot of wrecks.

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:16.796
Thank you so much for taking us out.

00:13:16.862 --> 00:13:18.030
No problem, guys.

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:19.064
That was perfect.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:22.935
These next two cars are so expensive,
They're locked away in a museum

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:24.136
at all times.

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:27.406
Combined, they cost $80 million.

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:31.110
And somehow we convinced the museum
to give us the cars.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.278
Looking good.

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:34.680
And this is where the video gets
literally mind blowing.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.082
Crank this bad boy up.

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:38.651
That's 30 miller.

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.085
Let's hear that 50 miller.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:44.123
Not going to lie. I like the
$50 miller one a little better.

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:47.493
So I jumped in the $50 million car
with Donut Media and Chandler

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:51.063
got in the $30 million car
with Beau Boeckmann, the car legend.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.464
You ready?

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:53.632
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:54.667
Let's do this.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.203
The reason the car
that Chandler's in is so expensive

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:59.972
is because it was constructed
specifically as a gift

00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:02.608
from the founder of Ferrari
to the founder of Ford.

00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:06.312
This is the only version of this
Ferrari ever made in human history.

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:07.613
Watch out for this bump.

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:08.380
No scraping.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.216
You don't really notice
how, like, crappy

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:13.752
the street is until you drive
something that's $50 million.

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:17.590
The car we're in is the most
expensive Jaguar in existence.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.793
It was the legendary actor
Steve McQueen's daily driver,

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:23.095
and he got so many speeding tickets
driving it,

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:25.464
his license was actually suspended.

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:27.533
I'm noticing
every single pothole now.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.735
And because these cars
are so expensive,

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:32.771
we have an entire police escort
dedicated to making

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:35.040
sure nobody comes close to the cars.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.275
This is insane.

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:37.576
Hey, get some speed.

00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:40.045
- How's it drive?
- Beautifully.

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:42.448
Oh my hat!

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:43.682
Oh well.

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:47.019
While we were all having fun,
Beau Boeckmann pushed

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:49.288
this $30 million car to its absolute limit.

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:53.759
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:55.227
Hold on. The car is stuck.

00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:56.195
Hold on one second.

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:58.030
We hit it too... too hard.

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:00.366
The $30 million car stalled.

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:02.268
We're going to hop out of
these things before we break them.

00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:05.971
Let's go drive the $100
million world's first Ferrari.

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:09.008
Most people would imagine
$100 million car

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:11.043
would look something more like this.

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:16.181
But you'd be surprised to find out
that this is the $100 million car.

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:20.486
This car is so historic and valuable
that this museum representative

00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:23.789
is literally the only person on earth
allowed to drive it.

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:26.392
It's only allowed to be driven
on this bridge.

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:28.627
We had cops completely closed
the roads.

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:31.463
We even had street cleaners
fill in every pothole

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:33.165
and clean the entire street to ensure

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:37.202
that there's no chance that we harm
this hundred million dollar car.

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:38.938
This is going to be crazy.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.240
All right.
And now we're on the bridge.

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.442
Oh, my God.

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:44.143
Look at that.

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:46.979
$100 million
barreling down the street.

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:51.216
Oh, I keep
losing my hat.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.685
He lost his hat.

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:54.853
That's the second time.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:56.655
