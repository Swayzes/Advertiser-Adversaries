00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.068
This is the largest shredder
in the world,

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:04.804
and this Lamborghini
is going to fall in it.

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:07.807
We're also nuking
an entire life size village,

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.378
shooting real tanks
at a literal Lamborghini,

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.481
and crushing this store
with the world's largest domino.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.950
This is the first
of many experiments.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.952
You're going to love this video.
You ready?

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:21.187
- Ready!
- This is going to be crazy.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.089
All right.
They're falling.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.190
Come on.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:26.459
All right, it's working.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:27.193
It's actually working.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.528
Are we going to have to run?

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.130
You hear the thud?

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:32.465
Oh, it's going.

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.768
All right, that was the tallest
domino in the world.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.337
That was the new tallest domino
in the world.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.506
Down goes the domino!

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.974
Oh, my God!

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.246
That was insane!

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.548
- That was crazy!
- We were way too close!

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:50.817
This isn't even the coolest thing
we're doing in this video.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.987
We're detonating the biggest
explosion in YouTube history,

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.090
launching a rollercoaster
off its track, and so much more!

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.658
Let's go to the next experiment.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:00.393
We got a lot of experiments today.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:01.127
And up next,

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.129
we're going to destroy
an entire village

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.131
with a massive creeper explosion.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.166
And just for reference,

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:08.635
a human sized version
looks like this.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.937
- Oh!
- Oh, okay.

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:13.840
But we're going to be detonating
one 50 times bigger

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.342
Steve, somehow you survived
the last creeper.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.711
This one… I'm not quite sure
you're going to survive.

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:20.180
We don't believe Steve's
going to make it?

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:20.880
Oh, heck no.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:25.085
Even though this is 50 times bigger,
it has 200 times the TNT.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:25.919
Bye, Steve.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.587
- Okay, let's head in the bunker.
- All right, Steve.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.422
Let's send Steve into the abyss.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.591
Just so you know
how big this creeper is,

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.493
Steve is actually taller than me.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:34.861
- He's getting close.
- We're in the Green Zone.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.663
This is going to be
a massive explosion.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:37.597
It's getting closer, any second now.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.032
I don't know
when it's going to happen.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.633
Oh, I'm scared.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.942
Oh, my gosh.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.312
- Oh, my God.
- I'm speechless, for once.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.746
I'm still processing that.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.483
- That was insane.
- How are we allowed to do this?

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.751
- We live in a country called America.
- Go, America.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:00.954
If you thought that was cool,
I got news for you.

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:03.623
It's about to get a whole lot cooler.
For our next experiment,

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.258
I bought another Lamborghini.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.061
- Adam, this is your Lamborghini.
- Thank you.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.796
And you're probably wondering,
though, what's the catch?

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.231
Yes. That's exactly
what I'm wondering.

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:12.098
How do I put this?

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:15.602
Recently, I may have obtained
a military grade tank.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.137
In exactly three days,

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.772
I'm going to be raining
missiles on your new car.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.641
And you get to use my credit card

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.776
to spend as much money
as you want trying to defend it.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.979
If the Lamborghini survives,
you have a brand-new car.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:28.081
I'm going to spend whatever
it takes to defend this Lambo.

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.349
That's why I gave you my card.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.750
Okay, fine. I'm going to do it.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.452
A lot of things racing
in my mind right now,

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:35.321
but it's simplified into Stop Shell,
win Lambo.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:38.057
Adam's first move was to call
a construction crew

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:41.161
to bring in building materials
and help him set up his first wall.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.731
I'm going to want all the walls
to kind of be a foot over my head.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:47.634
That'll at least protect
the direct shots on the Lambo.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.136
Now for the second part of my process,
it's going to be the pool.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.671
There was a MythBusters episode

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:54.040
where they were
shooting rounds into a pool,

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:56.342
so that should stop
the velocity heavily.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:59.712
Adams got a lot of work ahead of him
to keep his Lambo from danger.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:00.880
And speaking of danger,

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:03.516
we bought the world's
most dangerous roller coaster.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:06.052
And if you're
wondering why it's dangerous…

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:10.023
Basically, I put bombs on the ride.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.292
In theory, if you were to ride
this roller coaster,

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:13.993
you should get launched off this rail.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.362
The only question is
where would you land?

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.932
Let's see how far it goes
when it gets launched off it.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:21.734
And obviously, before we launch it,
we're going to put mannequins on it.

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:24.103
Everyone, put your mannequin
where you want.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:26.506
He's got a good head on his shoulders.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.574
And the final touch.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.476
Push! As hard as you can!

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.745
- All right, get out of the way.
- Go! Go! Go!

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.280
All right, there it is.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.748
This thing's going fast.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:39.018
All right. Now, it's going
to come down and go off the ramp.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:40.086
Here it goes.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.554
Go, go, go.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.132
All right.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.934
Oh, that actually scared me.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.936
To be honest,
I thought it would go further.

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:57.737
That was cool and all.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:58.771
Let's do that again.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.040
but with an explosive in the cart.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.910
Inside these boxes,
there's dozens of pounds of TNT.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:06.646
When we're done pushing,
run to the bunker.

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.281
You don't have to tell me to do that.

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:09.816
Go, go, go, go. We're going.

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:12.685
All right, I'm running.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:13.853
Go, guys. Go!

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.024
- Go quicker.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.259
Oh, my Gosh!

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:22.495
- Get inside.
- It's going down!

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.337
That was awesome!

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:34.040
It might not have flown 100 feet,
but at least we blew it up.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.376
But that explosion
is literally nothing

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.044
compared to what you're
about to see.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:40.213
For the next experiment,
we have three safes,

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:43.249
one that costs $1,000, $10,000,

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.585
and finally, the $100,000 safe.

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:46.619
It's bigger than me.

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:49.789
And we're going to see
how many explosives they can resist.

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:52.592
These are actual explosives.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:53.993
Why is Chandler bringing them in?

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:54.927
He's my dealer.

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.663
- Okay.
- Carefully set it down.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.699
I know this doesn't look like a lot,
but this is $1,000.

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.701
For however much
we spent on each safe,

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:03.636
we spent the same amount on TNT.

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.938
And we're going to see who wins
this $1,000 safe

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:07.540
or $1,000 in explosives.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.342
I'm going to put an egg
inside the safe.

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:11.311
Let's see if it turns
into scrambled eggs.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.548
Usually during explosives,
we have a wireless switch.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:17.050
This time, it's hardwired.

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.084
Why?

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.826
That actually scared me.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.495
Well, the egg in the safe
literally don't exist anymore.

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.496
Let's try this again

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:33.933
with 10 times the explosives
and a safe 50 times stronger.

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:34.634
No joke,

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:36.636
this thing has three-inch-thick steel.

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:38.071
Grab a crate of explosives.

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.839
This is like explosive Jenga.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:40.740
Oh, my gosh.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.775
We're like putting presents
around a Christmas tree.

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.610
The last egg did not survive.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.280
Let's see if a $10,000 safe
can protect it.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.248
Is this safe
really worth ten grand

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:50.850
if it can't protect an egg from TNT?

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.919
I don't know
if safes are meant to stop TNT.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:55.655
- This button is hot.
- You want to hit it?

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:57.290
I do. 3, 2, 1, go!

00:05:57.724 --> 00:05:58.958
Oh!

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:06.199
- What? Oh, my…
- Bro.

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:07.934
The next one is supposed
to be 10 times bigger.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.634
Than that one,

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.570
which was ten times
bigger than the previous one.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.905
Oh, my God.
He put a divot in the ground.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.575
Yo, can you guys believe Nolan's
mom fell right here?

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:17.009
Oh, my God.

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.412
It broke the glass
on the hundred thousand safe.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:22.548
In hindsight, I should've
put the safes further apart.

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.917
Ever since we were born,
we've always wondered

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:28.921
if you put $100,000 worth
of explosives around $100,000 safe,

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.656
would it protect an egg?

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:31.524
The age-old question.

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.326
You're in luck
because I'm about to answer it.

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:36.129
So heavy!

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.400
This safe is now surrounded
by $100,000 in explosives?

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.301
You could say it's unsafe now.

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:44.737
Out of every explosion
we've ever done,

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:46.973
what you're about to see
is the biggest by far.

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:49.742
 Our videos have gone so crazy
that people think we fake them.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:51.611
This is a real explosion.

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:54.647
Three, two, one.

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:07.260
I don't even have any words.

00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:10.897
- We woke up everybody in the city.
- Everybody in the entire state.

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:13.399
Let's see if the egg survived.
Oh, my gosh.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.501
Bro, the back of the safe is gone.

00:07:15.535 --> 00:07:17.103
Bro, it broke the foundation.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.304
It's all cracked in the floor.

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:19.539
It seems like they
put all their effort

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:23.309
in the 37,000 pound door
and not the walls of the safe.

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:24.777
And the egg did not survive.

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.512
If you ever want to rob a bank,

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:28.915
just buy a hundred grand worth of TNT.

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:32.952
in the meantime, Adam had been going
all night building his structure.

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:35.254
It's like 2:00 a.m.,
still so hot out here.

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.689
And when I came back in the morning,

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:39.258
I noticed he had some
pretty interesting ideas for it.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.694
Adam!
What am I looking at?

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:43.062
Scrapyard had a lot of cars,

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:45.097
I'm going to have at least
two layers of cars

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:46.466
and I'm probably going to stack them.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.901
The real secret is I'm going to be
using the engine block to stop it,

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.570
That should give it
more stopping power

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:51.904
than just the side of a vehicle.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.474
So far, Adam has
two cinder block walls,

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:57.743
two layers of stacked cars
and three pools full of water,

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:00.646
all just to protect
this Lamborghini from the tank's shot.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.748
What do you think the odds are
that the Lambo survives?

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:04.984
That Lambo's mine, baby.
We're going to get it done.

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:06.619
But I wasn't about to go easy on it,

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.721
so we brought in extra support
for tomorrow.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.890
Boys! Bring them in!

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.759
Oh, my gosh.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:14.427
Jimmy.

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:16.162
Now that we brought in two more tanks, 

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:18.297
the Lambo will be
targeted from all sides.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.999
Adam doesn't stand a chance.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:22.134
You have a little less
than 24 hours left.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.402
Good luck, Adam.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:24.303
You're going to need it.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:26.906
All jokes aside,
I am actually stressed out about that

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.474
If I'd known there were
going to be three tanks,

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:30.276
I would've strategized
completely different.

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:32.478
While you're building,
we're going to go test the tanks.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.412
Oh, great.

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:34.247
Thanks.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.548
Kris. Do you want to do the honors?

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:36.682
- Yeah.
- Too bad.

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:40.520
The test we built consists
of a hundred pound safe,

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:43.890
a trampoline
and bulletproof glass. But…

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:48.661
Did it go through it?

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:51.264
Oh, I can literally see through it
from back here.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.366
This is the weakest
of the three tanks.

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:54.367
Adam is screwed.

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:56.435
While Adam was wrapping up
his protection

00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:57.537
for his Lamborghini,

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.405
we're going to throw one
into a shredder.

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:00.940
And to show you
how powerful it is,

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:02.675
I'm going to shred
some other stuff first.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.478
- Karl, send it.
- Here we go! Yeah.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.746
Let's see what happens.

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:09.248
Oh, yeah!

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:10.683
That is so awesome!

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:14.387
That doesn't sound like piano noises.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.421
Yeah!

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.623
I think we need to wash down
that piano.

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:19.258
I agree.
Send the coke.

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:21.494
I'm 99% sure these are going
to blow up.

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:23.262
Oh, there it goes!

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:26.432
And while we're doing this,

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:27.934
I want to tell you guys
about Creator League.

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.835
It's a gaming league brought to you
by eFuse

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:31.904
and eight of the biggest
gaming entertainers in the world.

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:33.739
It's like having a front row
season ticket,

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:34.874
but you're not just watching.

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.242
You're actively drafting teams,

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:38.511
changing strategies
and sharing in the reward.

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:39.545
Oh, my God.

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:41.914
Up next, we have
a Hershey's vending machine.

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.183
I'll do you guys a favor
by getting rid of it.

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:44.784
There it goes.

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.586
There goes the Hershey's.

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:49.355
Is it stuck?

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.791
Turns out not even this
massive shredder

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:52.925
can digest Hershey's.

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:54.493
When you purchase
a Creator League pass,

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:55.795
you're able to influence the league,

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.663
compete at weekly tournaments,
win prizes,

00:09:57.663 --> 00:09:59.865
and potentially even meet
some of your favorite influencers.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.901
And if you sign up in
the next seven days,

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:04.003
you'll receive a free box
of Feastables.

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:06.472
I'm grabbing the porta potty.

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:09.208
Who taught Kris how to use this stuff?

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.711
Creator League gives you full control
over what games creators play.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.012
Kris, drop it!

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:14.046
Who's on each team,

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:16.182
What are the rules,
and so much more.

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:17.283
Oh, it smells.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.884
We've been in this junkyard
for 10 hours,

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:20.319
and even I took a
poop in that earlier.

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:21.821
One Creator pass equals
one vote,

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:22.922
and you have full influence

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.724
over almost everything
they do in the league.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.225
Click the link in the description
down below

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:27.727
and sign up for Creator League
right now.

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:30.596
while we clean out this shredder
to get it ready for the Lamborghini,

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.598
we're going to go shoot
another one with tanks.

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.166
And things aren't looking good
for Adam.

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:36.369
because he was running
into a ton of problems

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:37.903
on his last night of filming.

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:40.106
We're hitting some issues.
We need some things.

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.642
Nothing's open, not being able
to get enough resources.

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:44.043
This is my last bricks.

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:45.845
I can't believe we even
got these done.

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:47.847
three tanks is just impossible.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.115
I got to work through
the rest of the night.

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:51.684
I wouldn't forgive myself
if I went to sleep now.

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:53.719
Adam.

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:54.820
Hi, Jimmy.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.756
Please tell me
you're not still building.

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:58.124
Can I get five more hours?

00:10:58.157 --> 00:10:59.558
Over the last 24 hours.

00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:01.794
Adam has managed
to stash 20 more cars,

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:03.696
build four more walls to the sides,

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:05.831
and he also put two more giant pools.

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:07.833
But you went out of your way
to build this pool,

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:08.801
but didn't fill it up.

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:10.069
Yup. I ran out of time to fill it up.

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:11.370
You should learn time management.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.538
Yes, I should.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.940
Noticing a lot less cars over here.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.675
Yeah.

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:17.009
Oh, I see you put sand in here.

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:18.544
Does it make it harder to push over?

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:19.679
It'll be fine,

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.114
Bro, do you just not want the Lambo?

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:23.416
It's going to work.

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:24.150
Okay.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.753
This might be the last time
we see this Lamborghini in one piece.

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:28.521
Stay strong.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:29.822
I'll be back soon.

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:32.291
And I've obtained 20 real tank shells.

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.392
Don't ask me how.

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:36.028
And we're not going to stop firing
until we use all of them.

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:37.830
The boys are loading the tanks.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.031
This is going to be awesome.

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.866
- Why is mine so small?
- You know why.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.435
The moment of truth.

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:45.604
Are you ready? Three, two, one.

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:48.974
Oh. One of my pools.

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:50.042
We got a pool.

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:51.110
No, no, no.

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:54.013
Our first shot literally
hit the pool in front of the Lambo.

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.748
The water poured everywhere.

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:57.750
How much water did you put in those pools?

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.984
Oh, this is gross.

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:00.486
Fire in the hole!

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:04.356
Oh, my God.

00:12:04.356 --> 00:12:05.825
I'm still holding out faith.

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.827
Hey, this one at the same time.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.428
- All three.
- Oh, my God.

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:11.597
Three, two, one.

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:16.202
Adam's walls make it impossible
to see the Lamborghini from here.

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:17.636
So until we run out of ammo,

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:20.139
we have no idea if
his car made it or not.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.808
- I felt that one.
- Yeah, this is not good.

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:25.611
Reload the tanks. Kris.

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:27.379
Karl.

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:29.215
Nolan.

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:32.084
Your defense is not holding up there.

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:32.952
This is not good.

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:34.620
I'm kind of grasping the straws
at this point.

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:35.788
I've done all I can do.

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:37.056
Fire in the hole.

00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:38.958
I have way too much power.

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.392
I was so confident today too.

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:45.931
I love how is just rapid-fire tanks
right now.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.638
My only hope is that they're missing.

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:56.542
Anyways, what were you saying?
Last shot.

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.244
Adam, this time
you don't get a choice.

00:12:58.244 --> 00:12:59.979
- You have to pull.
- If Imma go down,

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:01.647
Imma go down looking like a G.

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:03.916
All right.

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:05.217
Oh, he's running!

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:07.753
Adam's car, it's done for.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:08.721
I can't see.

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:10.756
I can't see.

00:13:11.056 --> 00:13:12.625
Let's go!

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:13.726
Come on!

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:15.427
Wait. Are there no holes in it?

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.229
- Man, let's go baby!
- You did it!

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:19.031
What's crazy is, even though the cars

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:20.900
aren't strong enough
to stop the rounds,

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.368
they were able to deflect them

00:13:22.401 --> 00:13:23.602
away from the Lamborghini.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.337
- There's a bullet in the pool.
- Oh, my God.

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:26.806
There's a bullet in the pool.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.108
The pool right
in front of the Lamborghini,

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:30.676
caught a bullet for you.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:31.944
Thank you, MythBusters.

00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:33.445
I owe you this,
but Imma keep the Lambo.

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:34.346
Oh, my gosh.

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:35.481
Oh, will he fit?

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:37.683
Hey, he fits!

00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:39.919
Hey, we're gonna make it work.

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:41.520
That's fine.
We're gonna make it work.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.622
Congratulations on the Lambo.

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:44.824
Let's go shred another one.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.660
And now, the moment you savages
have been waiting for.

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:50.763
This hunk of metal is going
in the world's largest shredder.

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:52.932
- Is it time?
- It's time!

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:53.933
Let's drop it.

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:55.100
Karl, are you ready?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.636
- Ready!
- Send the Lamborghini!

00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:01.340
This suspense is killing me.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.442
- Oh, my God.
- It's hanging over the edge!

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.277
Oh, my God!

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:06.245
There it goes.

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:08.614
Lamborghini versus
the world's largest shredder.

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:09.982
It's about to... Oh!

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:15.754
Yeah!

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:17.957
Look at it.
It looks like it's dancing.

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:20.359
This is the coolest
thing I've ever seen

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:22.027
Bro, our building's shaking.

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:26.232
Oh. The car's fighting back.

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:27.933
I think we need to push it down.

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:29.568
It's stuck in the Lamborghini tires,

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:31.403
so the crane's going to push it down.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.808
Whoa.

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.277
Yeah!

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:41.180
Shred the car. Shred the car.

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:42.514
It's doing it.

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:44.683
Oh, my God. All right.

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:47.119
And that is what a shredded
Lamborghini looks like.

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:49.088
Don't worry, it didn't work.
It was decommissioned.

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:51.523
Subscribe, because we have
some insane videos coming up,

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:53.726
and I'd hate for you
to miss them. See you later.
