00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
In this video,

00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:04.437
we're going
on a $250,000 vacation.

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:05.505
This is beautiful.

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.140
How is this real?

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.943
And I'm going to show you
the difference between

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.179
this and a $100,000
presidential vacation.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.247
Right this way, sir.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.150
A $50,000 vacation where we have
the Eiffel Tower

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.551
completely to ourselves.

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:20.020
I'm holding on for dear life.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.756
All the way down to this $1 vacation.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:25.692
Right over here, boys.
This shack is our vacation.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.395
- You can see inside of it.
- There's no walls, Jimmy.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.031
- Well, I mean, there is walls.
- This is gross.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.133
And in case you don't believe me,
it's a dollar.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.502
- Look at that.
- Oh, it's $0.93. You're a liar.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.404
I rounded up to a dollar. For $1

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.639
we get this bed, which is honestly
just a mattress

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.041
sitting on wood planks,

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.910
a broken cabinet,
a light that sort of works.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:45.745
Oh, look at that.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.415
And lastly, random noises
coming from the ceiling.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.651
I was hearing noises in the room,
and there's a raccoon on our roof.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.754
I feel like most people would be mad
if their hotel room had a raccoon.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.222
But for some reason, we're happy.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.291
- When is the check out time?
- Tomorrow.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.726
Keep in mind that
later in this video,

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.761
we're going on a $100,000 vacation.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.696
A $250,000 vacation.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.432
Can we just jump to that already?

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:06.933
No, because we got to suffer

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.768
so they can compare our
suffering to our happiness.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.103
They do like when we suffer.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.704
Are we all supposed
to fit on a single bed?

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.174
If we wanted four beds,
that'd be $4.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:15.909
First, let's get all this sand out.

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.046
The raccoon just ran in here.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.115
I'm gonna act like I didn't scream
like a little girl.

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:22.849
Up next,

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.652
a vacation that's 10,000 times
more expensive.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.488
Welcome to the
$10,000 a night vacation.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.757
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yo, this is sick!

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.659
Wait, what the heck is this?

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:34.494
This hotel room has jellyfish.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.097
- Okay, that's so unnecessary.
- Oh, there's a pool outside.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.631
It's a private pool.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.967
Does this not look like a scene
from a movie?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.269
Your hotel room walks
out to the beach.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.271
- Wow.
- Is this our own private beach?

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:46.506
Oh, my gosh.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.440
This is incredible.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:49.142
Tareq, since when is water this blue?

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.376
I don't know.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.513
This all inclusive vacation
also has a giant spa.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.215
Oh, yeah.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.749
A park filled with flamingos.

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.485
Oh, they're fighting

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.354
- Flamingos.
- And unlimited room service.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.589
Okay, what do you need?

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:03.523
All of it.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.993
The only negative of this place
is it doesn't have a raccoon.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.461
Hey, little guy.

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.696
But I don't blame them for that.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.732
When you spend $10,000
at this all inclusive resort,

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.667
we each get our own floor
of the building.

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:17.837
It looks exactly like Jimmy's,
except for I got the top floor.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.305
Oh, I have a hammock.

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.541
I think I can make it in the hammock
without getting wet.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:22.842
I didn't.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.945
Yo, look at your view!

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.313
- Chris!
- Hey.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:29.949
I caught it.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:31.451
- 3, 2, 1â€¦
- Hey!

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.753
All right, let me lay out
some rules.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.221
- Rule number one.
- Yeah.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.056
No more throwing pillows in my pool.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.559
Rule number two.

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.595
Sorry, Tareq. And now
what the hotel is known for,

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.297
this insane infinity pool

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.399
that extends over our
own personal beach.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.735
How does the water just not overflow?

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.537
I have so many questions.

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.239
I feel like a father
that took his kids on vacation

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.842
and is just watching them
hang out in the pool.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.245
The $10,000 vacation has been insane,

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.414
but not as insane
as our next vacation

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.183
all the way across the planet.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:07.253
And now the $50,000
vacation in Paris.

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.322
- Oui!
- Baguette!

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.157
Our $50,000 vacation

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:14.427
starts with a completely
private luxury ferry ride.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.062
What is that? That's the engine?

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.432
Bro, what is this, 1805?
Tareq, zoom in on that guy.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.100
He is filming us. Hey.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:23.836
- They waved back.
- Do you have a YouTube channel?

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.073
I don't think he speaks English.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:29.909
This vacation comes complete
with fantastic food.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.312
A tour of the entire city.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:32.912
All right.

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:35.582
And a luxury hotel room
with an amazing view.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.483
- This is kind of romantic, huh?
- Yeah.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:38.985
You and Chandler should kiss.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:42.088
And lastly,
we have a very expensive surprise.

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:43.623
So you guys are probably wondering,

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.124
it's a $50,000 vacation,

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:47.460
and we clearly haven't
spent 50 grand yet.

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:48.661
Yeah, where is it?

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:50.797
It's behind you.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:52.532
That's the Eiffel Tower.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.835
Yes. We have the entire Eiffel Tower
completely to ourselves.

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:56.569
Wait, actually?

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:57.036
Yeah.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.205
What portion of the 50 grand
was the tower?

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.173
Almost all of it.

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.976
We are at the Eiffel Tower.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:04.177
This feels like we're sneaking in.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.746
No, I'm not joking. It's ours.
No one else is here.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.414
We can just go
straight through the line.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:09.415
This feels illegal.

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.318
Most of the time,
this place is packed with people.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:15.255
And because we have the whole thing
completely to ourselves,

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.257
we're going to try
to get to the top of the tower.

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:19.392
I'm talking the very top.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.527
Boys, enough playing around.
Let's head up.

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:22.395
On the way up,

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:26.399
we stopped at the first floor,
over 187 feet in the air,

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:29.302
where we had a world class restaurant
all to ourselves.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.738
I love though, even though
we have the entire Eiffel Tower,

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.706
they still put us
in a corner of the restaurant.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:35.942
That's the elevator

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:37.577
coming from the top
of the Eiffel Tower.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.545
That looks terrifying. Open sesame.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.381
Thank you. I can see
my house from up here.

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:42.282
We're in France.

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:43.883
I can see my hotel from up here.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.753
- Look how high up we are.
- Oh, my ears are popping.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.488
What are we working with here?

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:49.355
Oh, my gosh.

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:51.257
You can see the whole city from here.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.325
This is crazy.

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:54.861
Tareq.
Look how much higher we have to go.

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:55.995
This is never going to end.

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:58.298
I'm not going to lie,
I thought we were already at the top.

00:04:59.032 --> 00:04:59.966
We're going up.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:01.634
Now we're heading to the top.
At one point,

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:03.336
this was the tallest building
in the world.

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:05.471
- Should I jump right now?
- No. Do not move.

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.507
Come on, boys, follow me.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.443
From here on out, there's no more
elevators, just stairs.

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:11.944
Oh, it's windy up here.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.781
We are high up there. Oh, my God.

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:16.716
Oh, my God.

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:18.451
Tareq,
don't drop the camera.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.987
We are standing over
900 feet in the air.

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:23.556
The highest point
civilians are allowed on the tower.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.526
But since it's ours for the night,
I had one last surprise.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:27.727
What do you think's
behind this door?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.561
Stairs.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.596
Actually, did I...

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.265
- How did you know?
- We can see the stairs.

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:33.700
Well, yes, there are more stairs,

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.668
but this takes us
to the very top

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.103
where no one's allowed to go.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:39.739
Oh, my gosh.

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:41.741
Bro.

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:42.742
Oh, my God.

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.677
- Are we allowed on that?
- I don't know.

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:47.013
Oh, that is scary.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:49.015
The ledge just comes up
to my waist up here.

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.350
I am holding on for dear life.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.819
I completely understand
why tourists are not allowed up here.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:54.654
We have a cameraman
on the other side of the city

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:55.955
with a lens zoomed in on us.

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.490
He's over a mile away.

00:05:57.523 --> 00:05:59.025
If this lens is good enough,

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:02.562
you should be able to see us
waving for a $50,000 vacation.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:03.963
You got to admit,
this is cool.

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:04.831
This is amazing.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:06.265
It'a a once in a lifetime experience.

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.368
Are you ready
for the best moment yet?

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.771
I don't know why a YouTuber
has this much power, but lights.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.474
Oh, there we go.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.342
Oh, my God.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.677
Like a disco show.

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.912
Holy cow!

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.915
Guys, I don't know
if this next command

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:25.852
is going to work,
but turn every light off.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.525
Oh, it's pitch black.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:34.127
The Eiffel Tower went dark.

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:36.896
What are these millions of French
people thinking right now?

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:40.933
They should get me off this tower.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.802
I don't know why
they gave me this much control.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:46.305
Next, we head to Switzerland
for the $100,000 vacation.

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:48.875
But this is no ordinary vacation.

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:51.744
This hotel has two inch thick,
bulletproof windows,

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:54.046
a panic button that will lock down
the entire building

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.382
and it's riddled with security
because this is a hotel

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.851
where world leaders and presidents
take their vacation.

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:01.387
And also the sidemen were in town.
So I invited them to come.

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.289
Oh, my God.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.524
It smells like food in here.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.192
We've got the whole ocean in there.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.927
- What?
- This is nuts.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.130
This is the most expensive penthouse
suite in all of Europe.

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:13.766
It covers the whole eighth floor,
has dozens of rooms,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.668
tons of staff waiting
on you day and night

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:18.004
and absolutely crazy food everywhere.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.806
You want a hit?
Yeah, get a hit of that.

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:21.340
Oh, yeah.

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:23.242
How do these guys compare
to your normal guests?

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.212
So you'd say they're
pretty dumb compared toâ€¦

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:29.382
Like I said before, some
of the most powerful world leaders

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:31.150
choose this place
for their vacations.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:34.387
Even Bill Clinton stayed here
and he wasn't assassinated.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.154
It's pretty safe.

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:37.990
In terms of security, here you
have the bulletproof windows.

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.759
Even this is bulletproof.

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.627
Oh, my. It feels thick.

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:43.396
Pretty solid.

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:44.697
I hope. I'm a president.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.566
There are also some snipers

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.934
that we can put on the rooftop.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.435
You have your own snipers.

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:53.706
Are you able to negotiate
on behalf of the Sideman?

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:55.174
- I can try my best.
- Yes.

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:57.009
This will help me in my negotiation.

00:07:57.043 --> 00:07:58.711
I'd like to buy a 10%.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:01.180
- How much, boys?
- Go, you say it.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.815
200 million, Jimmy.

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:04.083
200 million.

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:07.453
All right. To the panic button.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.055
- Oh, no.
- I'm not going to lie.

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:11.457
I've been wanting to press
this button since we got here.

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:13.359
We all agree this is a good idea.

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:14.827
- No.
- No.

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.896
Karl. You're Bill Clinton,
and you feel threatened.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:19.232
Press the panic button.
You pressed it.

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:22.335
Oh, wait.

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.203
- I see a door closed.
- Are we locked in?

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.638
- Is it locked?
- Are you guys in there?

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.405
Is that Nolan?

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:27.940
Yeah. The door's like shut.

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:29.308
I walked off for one second.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:30.776
This button opens it.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.112
You don't get to panic
and then open it.

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:34.947
If you press the button now,

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:35.882
the police will come.

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:36.883
And there's a big fine.

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:37.984
Don't press it again.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.052
I've been thinking.

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:42.588
How would a president
get somewhere like McDonald's?

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:44.657
Let's see how presidents travel.
Come on in.

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.225
It turns out
when you're the president,

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:48.327
you have to go everywhere
with your bodyguards.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.162
So that means that when you driveâ€¦

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.998
Oh, we got an entourage.

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:53.299
How do we know which car to get into?

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:54.467
On the third or the fourth.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.835
Ideally the third or fourth.

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.271
- Which car is the most dangerous?
- The first one.

00:08:58.304 --> 00:08:59.539
Nolan, you should ride
the first one.

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:01.207
- I can do that.
- Okay.

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:02.141
Who wants to ride with me?

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:03.009
Harry, come on in.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:03.709
Harry, Chandler.

00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:05.211
I'm sure the president
doesnâ€™t sit in the middle.

00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:06.913
Typically,
you guys would be my bodyguards.

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:08.281
But, you know, you'll suffice.

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:09.849
Just squeeze in mate.
Squeeze in.

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:11.984
What president
is going to McDonald's?

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:14.053
Does your window roll down?
Hey, how's it going?

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:16.856
Now we're gonna get shot!

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.157
I can't believe we can do this.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.392
This is nice.

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:21.594
Turns out when you travel
in a presidential motorcade,

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:23.229
a lot of people start to notice you.

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:24.030
How's it going?

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:24.997
This is bonkers, man.

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:26.732
I love how we just draw
the attention of everyone.

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:27.400
People are filming,

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:28.701
like we're the president.
This is weird.

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:30.603
Which made McDonald's
a little awkward.

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:34.874
What's going on?

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:36.142
Don't mind our security.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.344
Jimmy, does this beat out
the Eiffel Tower for you?

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:39.845
Depends how good these nuggets are.

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.314
Obviously, all of the vacations

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:42.415
so far have been amazing,

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:44.584
but they pale in comparison
to the next one.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.287
Our final vacation is once again
across the planet.

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:51.657
And now we're in Japan
for the $250,000 vacation

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:53.559
and we're meeting up
with a special guest here,

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.294
so you're gonna want
to watch till the end.

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:56.829
To start off our vacation

00:09:56.896 --> 00:10:00.633
we dropped off our bags in the most
expensive hotel in all of Japan.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:01.701
This is gigantic.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.469
I have an echo in a hotel room.

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:04.370
And afterwards,

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:06.672
we felt like getting to know
the city of Tokyo.

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:08.774
Now we're going to drive
Mario Karts on the street.

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:12.244
We rented private Mario Karts

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:15.047
but we get to literally drive
on the streets of Japan.

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:16.482
People are just staring at us.

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:18.084
This is not meant to be on a street.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.319
There's real cars
driving right beside me.

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:22.622
Well, look how many people
are crossing the street here.

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:23.522
This is the busiest

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:26.025
crosswalk in the world,
and we're driving right through it.

00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:29.428
We're on Go-karts in Tokyo.
Go-karts!

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.429
I love Japan.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.764
This place is crazy.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.733
When we arrived
at our next destination,

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:36.502
we met with master swordsman
Yoshioki Sumida.

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:39.505
He's been training with the katana
for the last 26 years,

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:42.008
and he actually agreed to giving us
a rare lesson

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:43.376
in the art of the Samurai.

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:45.611
We each got our own katanas

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.147
and the lesson began
with swinging techniques.

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:51.384
It was not as easy as we thought.

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:58.290
No, they're going to zoom in on it.

00:10:58.357 --> 00:10:59.492
Then it was my turn.

00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:01.193
Boys, you think I'm gonna
be able to do this?

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:02.895
- Yes.
- Yeah, you got it.

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:09.568
Hey! Let's see how the boys do.

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:14.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.175
Who am I?

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:20.713
And then, our samurai teacher
gifted us this insane katana.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.281
I don't deserve this, but thank you.

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:24.750
And because this is a quarter million
dollar vacation,

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:27.920
we rented out the most premium
sushi chef in the world,

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:30.056
along with this entire
floating restaurant.

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:31.757
They got Louis Vuitton coasters.

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:34.760
The chef makes all the food right
next to our table, and getting to see

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:37.596
a master at work was one of
the coolest dining experiences

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.631
I've ever had.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.667
Oh, wow.

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:42.601
Oh, my God.

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:45.371
They said we could
feed the birds tuna.

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:46.672
Here you go, little man

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:47.873
See how he caught him
in the air?

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:49.008
And once we paid the billâ€¦

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.409
Thank you.

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:52.611
we were off to the craziest place
I've ever been.

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:54.313
Follow me.
I rented this whole place.

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:56.215
But before we see it, socks off.

00:11:56.282 --> 00:12:00.052
This is basically an art museum,
but for experience.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.089
Oh, my God.

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:04.290
I have goosebumps.

00:12:04.323 --> 00:12:06.726
My eyes are having a hard time
processing it.

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:08.761
You think this is what it looks like
when you die?

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:09.695
Probably.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.464
What is this next room?

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:14.700
Normally, this place
is completely full of other people,

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:17.436
but we secured the entire experience
for ourselves.

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:19.538
This might be one of the best things
we've ever done.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.307
Dude, are these fish?

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:22.408
We're in a pool,

00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:25.111
in a museum playing
with animated fish.

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:27.880
This is the most unique thing
you could ever do on a vacation.

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:29.482
Wait, the fish are surrounding us.

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:30.916
How did they know to surround us?

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:31.884
They love us.

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:33.219
They're going everywhere now.

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:34.787
Now you're all probably hungry.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.757
Which is why we're at this restaurant
that is ran by robots.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.390
What?

00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:39.625
My name is Pepper.

00:12:39.692 --> 00:12:40.926
Can we have a seat, Pepper?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.562
Sure.
Let's find a comfortable spot.

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:45.131
We've reserved the entire place,

00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:47.666
so the only other people here
were the robot waiters.

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:48.834
Food robot is here.

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:50.736
Wait, so the food is delivered
on a robot?

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.438
An oddly fluffy robot.

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:54.673
Pepper staring really hard
at Chandler.

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:56.375
Pepper does not like Chandler.

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:58.110
Bro, I did nothing to you.

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:01.213
Everyone make sure
you eat tons of food

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:03.749
'cause tomorrow I rented
an entire theme park

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.519
and PewDiePie is going to be there,
which is really crazy.

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:09.755
You see, PewDiePie
and I have a long history.

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:12.191
I was wondering
when you would show up.

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.261
We helped him in a subscriber race
against T-series.

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:16.028
Grab your phone.

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:18.631
Go on YouTube, search PewDiePie
and subscribe to him.

00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:20.466
Eventually, we even caught up to him.

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:23.869
Mr. Beast has taken
over me in subscribers.

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:25.938
I guess I'm getting a taste
of my own medicine.

00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:27.439
That's all right.
He definitely deserves it.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.008
And even though we've
been friends for a while,

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.843
we've never actually met in person.

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:33.145
And because this is such
a long awaited meetup,

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:35.447
I rented this entire amusement park.

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:37.249
This is Fuji-Q Highland,

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:40.019
the park with the scariest rides
in all of Japan.

00:13:40.052 --> 00:13:42.555
It usually has thousands of people
waiting in line.

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:43.722
But as per usual,

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:46.091
I rented the whole thing
just for us.

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:47.993
You can ride whatever ride you want.

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.296
I wasn't done but he left.

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:52.464
I'm about to go on this entire
roller coaster alone.

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:55.201
What you're seeing here is
the steepest roller coaster drop

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:55.935
in the world.

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:56.769
Are you scared?

00:13:56.802 --> 00:13:58.537
- Yes.
- Have fun!

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.611
I'm scared for him.

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:09.114
And like I promised,

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:13.652
the father of YouTube,
PewDiePie, met us in the park.

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:18.023
A little later than planned
because I texted on the wrong day.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:18.858
Sorry, Felix.

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:21.560
And he wanted to ride
the craziest coaster at the park.

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:22.294
Why are you scared?

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:24.163
I'm so scared of roller coasters.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.564
This is one doesn't spin at all.

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.066
I'll ride it if Felix rides it.

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:29.201
- Let's go!
- I'm terrified.

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:31.437
I'll do it. I'll do it.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.006
If I die on this roller coaster,
you guys are going to feel terrible.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:34.840
You take your shoes off?

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.743
- Anything that could fly out.
- That's how you know this is bad.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.912
They don't even trust us
with shoes on this ride.

00:14:39.945 --> 00:14:41.680
You got this. You'll be fine.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:42.648
I cannot.

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.149
This was my worst nightmare.

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:46.185
I'm scared, I don't want
to do this.

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:47.653
You're scaring me. Calm down!

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:51.290
Whatever you do, don't throw up.

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:53.158
I'm terrified.
Can we pick a better one?

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:55.027
We could have picked
a nice, comfortable ride.

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.395
I actually have no idea what it is.

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:58.998
At some point,
there's a literal 90 degree drop.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:01.901
You're freaking me out.
What did you sign me up for?

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:03.469
You brought me here.

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:07.039
But what we didn't know was

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.274
this ride goes backwards.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.708
Why are we going backwards?

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:14.980
Why did I do this?

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:17.116
Oh, my God. We're upside down!

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:18.951
Jimmy!

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:23.322
This is crazy!

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:25.391
Best roller coaster ever!

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.525
Oh, my gosh.

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.027
Felix, what did we just do?

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:28.961
I'm crying.

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:30.129
Best roller coaster ever.

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:32.031
I got tears just running down.

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:35.067
It was good meeting you, Jimmy.
I'm gonna head out.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.068
Oh, yeah.

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:39.038
You screamed
at the first little bow.

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:41.740
What?

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:43.175
Thank you.

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:46.045
I don't think I've ever had
a chewy potato before.

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:48.948
That's what you get for passing me.

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:51.750
Felix, I'm sorry for passing you.

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:53.886
You don't have to threaten me
with violence though.

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:55.554
- They're good.
- Yeah, they are good.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:58.057
That was the $250,000 vacation.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.959
Felix, can you transition us?

00:16:00.025 --> 00:16:01.093
Bro fist.
