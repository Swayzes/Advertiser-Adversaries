00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.470
- The most dangerous thing
about the Tesla Cybertruck

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.020
is not the pointy edges and corners.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.180
It's not the fact that
it weighs over three tons

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.950
and goes from zero to 60 miles an hour

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.450
faster than a Corvette.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.040
It's not even the way that reflections

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.540
glare off the stainless steel

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.580
and can blind people on the highway.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.340
No, the most dangerous
thing about the Cybertruck

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.000
is the way it makes other people

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.043
around you on the road behave.

00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:29.804
(rhythmic music)

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:38.742
(music continues)

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:47.595
(music continues)

00:00:53.528 --> 00:00:56.361
(music continues)

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.900
Okay, I genuinely can't
tell if the Cybertruck

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.860
is good looking or not, and
I'm being completely serious.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.050
Like if you just check the
comment section online,

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.940
it's actually mostly negative.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.410
Most people are saying it looks horrible.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.450
It looks like a refrigerator on wheels.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.400
It's a disaster of a design.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.990
But once you start living with this thing,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.270
you drive around with it and
you talk to people about it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.740
who have never heard of it,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.720
they're saying things
like, "This is crazy.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.340
This is like a movie prop.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.700
It's sci-fi, looks something alien."

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.830
So there's a lot to it.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.310
Here, first of all, stainless
steel and black plastic.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.533
That's mostly what
you're working with here.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.780
And the front, I think
it has a good angle.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.910
To be honest, I'm a
sucker for a light bar,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.010
but the actual headlights are down here

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.690
so they stay outta people's eyes.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.660
In general, it's like a square jawline,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.000
no curves, just angles.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.020
But the back, the back not so much.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.060
You know, it's still
technically a bar, yes,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.700
but it's a little bit
dinker in my opinion.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.240
And also just tons of
black plastic in the back.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.130
Really high tailgate.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.040
I'm getting like, dump
truck vibes from back here.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.600
I don't think I'm the only one.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.640
I just, I don't think the
back is its best angle.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.530
But if I had to narrow it down,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.400
I'm pretty sure the most
iconic profile is the side.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.140
And the two elements of this truck

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.140
that really stand out are this
slope, these high shoulders,

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.850
and then the pointy
corners on the other side.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.540
See, most pickup trucks have
basically this general shape.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.640
It's the traditional pickup truck look.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.420
And so we're not used to
seeing this angle right here

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.480
and this huge slope right here.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.450
It's unusual, it's weird, it's
very visually interesting.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.190
So I've been living with the Cybertruck

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.480
for about a month now,
well over 1,500 miles.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.530
And you notice a couple things.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.410
First of all, people, whenever
you go park somewhere,

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.623
always wanna come up to
you and talk about it.

00:02:54.623 --> 00:02:57.210
Naturally, I've entertained
a lot of these conversations

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.350
'cause they're fun.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.230
And they usually say two things.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.610
One, you'd be surprised

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.950
how many people have never
heard of the Cybertruck.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.980
I know for us online people,
people watching this video,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.600
you're like, how could
anyone have not heard

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.070
of the Tesla Cybertruck?

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.660
But you'd be shocked.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.450
And two, most people just want to know,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.490
how much does that thing cost?

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.050
And I got asked that so many times,

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.390
eventually I just started
having people guess.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.770
And 100% of the people
who guessed were too high.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.120
People were guessing
$250, $300K, $180K, $150K.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.479
They're all way over.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.850
But you know, how could they know?

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.590
They don't know what the
rest of the truck is.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.580
They've just seen this thing

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.890
they've never seen for the first time.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.980
And so I guess the conclusion is the looks

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.980
are really distracting
people from the rest

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.430
of what makes the
Cybertruck, the Cybertruck.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.650
Okay, let's play a little game.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.480
I'm going to name a feature

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.910
and all you have to do is
think about it for a second

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.050
and think about if you believe
it's overrated or underrated.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.060
And then I, someone who's
been driving this truck,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.220
will tell you the real answer.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.400
So first feature, steer by wire.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.810
I've seen a few good pieces cover

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.800
what's actually happening here,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.350
talking about the complete
physical disconnect

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.480
between the steering wheel you're holding

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.400
and the wheels that are
moving under the truck.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.070
Instead, it's a bunch of
sensors reacting to your input

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.420
like a video game controller.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.850
But combined with the
variable steering ratio

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.650
and the four wheel steering,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.700
this is the most nimble,
agile-feeling truck

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.810
that I have ever driven.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.180
And I don't think a lot
of people realize that.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.650
So I'm going underrated.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.660
It's one of those things
where Tesla definitely

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.860
didn't have to do this.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.320
Like, they've made their
headlines already with the looks.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.420
It could just be a Model 3 underneath.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.640
But they went through the extra measures

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.080
and the extra engineering

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.505
to ship a full steer by wire system

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:49.530
and all the redundancies that
come with making it safe.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.300
I believe they're the
first ones to do this.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.980
But the variable steering ratio is really

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.240
what gives it all of its utility.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.370
So at low speeds, the ability

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.040
to turn really quickly gets dialed up.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.080
It's a much more
responsive-feeling steering wheel.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.350
So if I want to turn right
here, I only have to give it

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.420
what, half a turn, a quarter turn,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.590
and I'm fully maneuvering.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.360
The way you can pull into parking spots

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.490
and make 90 degree turns and everything

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.290
is a total game changer.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.250
But then at highway speeds
it softens that ratio a lot.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.870
So you have a little bit of steering input

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.050
to sort of glide left and
right between different lanes.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.490
It's much more subtle.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.690
You kind of need that.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.300
But then on top of that, throw
in the four wheel steering.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.770
So four wheel steering is not new,

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.850
lots of vehicles have done it.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.070
But the amount of steer

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.040
that you get from these rear
wheels is pretty dramatic

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.450
to the point where you
can look in the mirrors

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.880
and see those wheels turning.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.530
And this can also be
adjusted with software.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.950
But that really lets this
huge truck basically pivot

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.200
around a much smaller axis.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.420
The steering ratio now I think gives it

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.520
the same steering circle as a Model S,

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.950
but it feels really, really impressive

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.110
just because of how big
the actual vehicle is.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.400
It definitely takes some getting used to.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.870
You can't ignore that fact.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.340
But once you get used to it,

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.340
you literally feel like when
you go back to like, an F-150

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.450
or any other truck where you have

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.120
all this hand over hand
steering to do the K turns,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.591
that feels weird, it feels archaic.

00:06:08.591 --> 00:06:10.470
It feels like you
shouldn't have to do that.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.510
So again, Tesla definitely
didn't have to do that,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.380
but just the way you can
drive it like a smaller car

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.990
and really point the nose,

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.060
I don't know, it's definitely underrated.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.740
All right, next feature,
bulletproof stainless steel,

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.093
overrated or underrated?

00:06:28.503 --> 00:06:30.990
I'm going with, you probably
saw this one coming,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.250
I'm going with overrated.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.577
Now look, first of all I get it.

00:06:33.577 --> 00:06:37.020
Obviously having a very durable truck

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.120
is super useful of course.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.861
But bulletproof up to
nine millimeter rounds?

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.278
(Marques thumping truck)

00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:54.180
(sledgehammer thunking)

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.560
Yeah, I'm not gonna test that.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.300
But you know, there are some
other YouTubers out there

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.290
who totally will.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.140
And apparently it can
literally stop smaller rounds

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.000
without being punctured.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.760
But also, the glass
windows aren't bulletproof,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.370
they're more of just
stronger than regular glass.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.770
And then it's regular
wheels, regular tires

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.880
that can still get slashed.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.900
So don't go getting any ideas

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.030
that this thing is invincible
or anything like that.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.080
But clearly, cold rolled
stainless steel alloy

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.081
is going to be much stronger

00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:23.370
than the regular outside of the vehicle.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.400
So that's the shopping cart in
the back of the parking lot,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.170
that's fender benders.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.220
Or if someone hits you, you'll be fine.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.120
You'll be fine.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.953
But guess what?

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.580
It also means your truck is now made

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.490
of an extremely fingerprinting material.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.410
And it also doesn't
have normal door handles

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.420
so you just cannot keep it clean

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.590
if you use this thing daily.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.940
And then steel just happens to
be really hard to manipulate.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.640
Apparently Tesla had to create
new machines strong enough

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.530
to stamp this material together.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.670
There's a reason why there aren't a bunch

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.320
of other cars rolling
around looking like this.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.600
So when I say in the Auto Focus review

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.250
that low VIN Cybertrucks

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.027
will have low VIN production issues,

00:08:02.027 --> 00:08:04.260
that's not actually new to Tesla.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.870
They've had to spin up
manufacturing for different types

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.280
of vehicles before,

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.330
and usually the first few
thousand of them aren't pretty.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.860
But then they learn from those issues

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.570
and then one or two years down the road

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.250
they're making millions of the thing

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.990
and they're much better
quality controlled.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.020
So this particular Cybertruck

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.070
is the dual motor all-wheel drive.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.020
This was borrowed from Ridge.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.070
Shout out to Ridge by the way.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.540
I'll leave a link below
if you aren't caught up

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.560
on my partnership with them.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.850
But on delivery, this one
had a pretty big panel gap

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.740
on the driver's side door.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.230
And you know, I never really
care about panel gaps,

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.130
but this one in particular
actually started growing

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.390
and getting worse.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.340
It literally looked
like the door was open,

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.500
and then it started making
weird noises while closing.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.650
Until one day it actually broke.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.390
So turns out it wasn't a panel gap,

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.660
it was actually a manufacturing
issue where the bolts

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.580
that hold this latch in place

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.960
were actually not torqued tight enough

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.420
and they loosened over
time and it fell out.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.340
And so Miles actually had the bright idea

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.370
to just gaffe tape the latch
securely back in place.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.870
And now when you close the
door, lines up perfectly.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.930
So Elon Musk addressed this
on Twitter after my video.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.140
Apparently only 15 trucks had this issue,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.940
so lucky me, I guess.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.380
So if you are one of the few,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.850
then you can apparently just take this

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.930
to a Tesla service center

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.280
and they'll be able to fix it in no time

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.810
as long as you get an appointment.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.450
The Cyberbeast that I took
delivery of under my name

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.000
has been flawless so far.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.680
But I think the point
I'm trying to make is

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.130
these early Cybertrucks, as
with any other early Tesla,

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.970
they're going to find,

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.650
I guarantee you, more issues like this.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.660
And they'll work on 'em and fix 'em.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.080
But yeah, this Foundation
Series badge right here,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.970
kind of clouted in the Tesla community

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.970
'cause it basically means
you got one of the first few.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.970
But it also kind of means
willing beta tester in a way.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.800
So you know, these materials
and this new stamping technique

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.870
and all this should
eventually make the vehicles

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.200
much easier to produce
en masse, and cheaper.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.663
But that's eventually, eventually.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.690
All right, next feature, truck stuff.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.390
I'm talking about the
theoretical reasons why someone

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.390
would logically buy a truck
over any other vehicle

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.480
like a van or an SUV or a car.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.310
And that would be for towing,
hauling and off-roading.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.030
And I know it looks like
this truck would be amazing

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.280
at all of that stuff, but I'm gonna say

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.400
that this one, it's overrated.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.870
It's overrated here,
and I'll tell you why.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.230
Now, don't get me wrong, the
Cybertruck, very capable.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.320
It's much more capable than
any other Tesla, obviously.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.260
I can confirm it handles
winter weather really well.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.750
Like it has heated windshield
wiper and the heated mirrors

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.570
and the door can in fact
open in icy weather.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.250
They added a wade mode

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.080
that lifts the suspension all the way up

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.390
and pressurizes the battery
so that you can drive

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.280
through really deep water.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.113
It's insane.

00:10:57.113 --> 00:10:58.890
And it also has off-road driving modes

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.200
and towing modes right
here in the settings.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.080
There's also only one
wheel and tire option

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.400
right now with Cybertruck.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.870
Every single Cybertruck ships

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:11.870
with the same Goodyear Territory
Wrangler RT Tire, whatever.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.320
It's a pretty popular tire

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.630
and they ship them on, you
know, Jeep Grand Cherokees

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.920
and F-150s all the time.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.240
And it's reinforced

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.370
and it's capable of
some light off-roading.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.380
But I think if we're being honest,

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.250
most people will be driving
this thing mostly on the street,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.840
like a glorified SUV.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.310
So here's a number to think about, 63.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:37.170
63% is the percent of truck
drivers who admit to rarely

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.130
or never towing anything at all.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.390
And that's just the ones that admit it.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.380
Like, look at this chart.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.810
This is from a survey of F-150 owners,

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.420
so the most popular truck in the country.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.750
People are almost never actually
towing with these things.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.650
So before we leave a comment

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.950
that this thing sucks for
towing, yeah, they know, we know.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.160
Everyone buying it kind
of should already know.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.470
If you're buying a truck
specifically for towing,

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.660
then you have a short list
of trucks you're considering

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.250
and none of them are electric.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.200
But I think my main
realization with this thing

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.930
is there are millions of preorders
for this thing right now.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.600
Because it's Tesla, it's
going to be very popular.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.140
This is gonna be a lot
of people's first truck

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.470
and it will come with all of
the first truck realizations.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.303
Like to a lot of people,

00:12:20.303 --> 00:12:23.400
the Cybertruck looks absolutely huge,

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.740
but it's actually smaller than an F-150.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.030
And these people, when they get the truck,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.610
they'll think they're invincible
and they can drive off road

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.370
and just go wherever they want
without even thinking about

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.500
strategically going certain routes

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.090
or airing down the tires

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.760
that literally come at
50 PSI from the factory.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.320
They're gonna start
getting stuck in all sorts

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.150
of embarrassing situations, which means

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.070
of course then there will
be countless articles

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.903
written about them

00:12:44.903 --> 00:12:46.800
because of course no other truck has ever

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.420
been stuck in the snow before.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.130
And it's just, sorry,

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.390
I'm definitely getting ahead of myself.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.300
But look, we will be using a Cybertruck

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.760
at our video production studio
for a lot of the same reasons

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.290
that we've used an R1T.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.980
It's got a tow hitch, it's
spacious, it hauls a lot of gear,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.230
it's quick, it's quiet, it's great.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.330
But I think the point
I'm trying to make is

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.660
most of the millions of
people who will end up

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.885
with these Cybertrucks eventually

00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:16.110
are going to use them on the street

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.150
just like a glorified SUV

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.120
just 'cause they think
this one looks cool.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.953
And that's fine.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.530
All right, next category, performance.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.290
Overrated or underrated?

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.520
Well, you might have
seen this little video

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.590
that Tesla did on their YouTube channel

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:38.040
racing the Cybertruck
against a Porsche 911

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.820
while towing a 911 and beating that 911.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.000
And that, that was a very clever video.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.200
It's an ad, of course,

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.490
but it also takes advantage of the fact

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.310
that EVs all have this commoditization

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.860
of this enormous straight
line performance,

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.120
great acceleration.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.320
Anyone can get it.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.427
But you know, I'd normally
never compare a pickup truck

00:13:59.427 --> 00:14:01.773
to a sports car, right?

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.983
But well, we're here.

00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:08.846
(energetic music)

00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:17.556
(music continues)

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.293
(music continues)

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:32.260
(car revving)
(truck humming)

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.221
(race signal beeping)

00:14:38.221 --> 00:14:40.721
(car roaring)

00:14:42.302 --> 00:14:45.135
(music continues)

00:14:50.942 --> 00:14:53.775
(music continues)

00:14:57.521 --> 00:15:00.354
(music continues)

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.000
So like most drag races,
this one was just for fun.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.590
But while we have some
time at this drag strip,

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.710
we did a bunch of these, we
did back to back to back races.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.530
And it shed a lot of
light on Tesla's video

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.820
and on the Cybertruck in general.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.760
So first of all, EVs are quick, right?

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.900
We've known this for years.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.290
Ludicrous mode, Plaid mode, Beast mode.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:23.670
This is not new information.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.630
But cars with gears can be faster.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.540
So there's a difference
between quick and fast.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.030
So when you go to a real drag
strip with timing equipment

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.880
and all that stuff, you
get one of these after.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.810
This is a time slip.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.980
Breaks down in both lanes,

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.840
not just the end of the 1/4 mile

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.910
but multiple points along the race.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.130
And so I've expanded it here.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:47.070
So this was the triple
motor Cybertruck's best run,

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.270
one of the first runs.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.760
It runs a 10.9 second 1/4 mile,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.750
which if you don't know,
is absolutely ridiculous.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.570
There are bonafide sports cars
that don't run in the 10s.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.150
And for a 7,000 pound pickup truck

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:04.200
to do it on all terrain tires
is just kind of hilarious.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.790
But when you actually
look at and break down

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.550
each of these times,
this shows the difference

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.920
between quick and fast.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.660
So first of all, off the launch,

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.070
just from zero miles an hour,

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.870
the Cyberbeast with its triple motors

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.120
and with its 1000 hertz traction control

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.080
managing slip at the rear
wheels basically in real time

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.090
is able to explode off the line

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.040
through the first 60 feet of the race

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.440
faster than the 911 Turbo S,

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.360
one of the fastest-launching
cars ever made.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.370
Now from there, it holds that lead,

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.440
continues putting down all of this power

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.840
all the way out to 330 feet.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.220
So you can see that at 330 feet,

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.160
4.4 versus 4.5, it's still out ahead.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.260
But by the time you get to 660 feet,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.780
which is roughly halfway through the race,

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.050
that's when the 911
has changed gears twice

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.460
and continues to pull.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.140
And this is when it shifts

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.900
and passes the truck around
halfway through the race.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.190
Physics just takes over,

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:59.130
and the lighter car with many
more gears continues to shift.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.570
It passes the truck.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.460
Crazy enough, the Cybertruck hits

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.790
its 114 mile an hour
electronically limited top speed,

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.230
probably 'cause of the tires,

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.000
well before the end of the 1/4 mile,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.730
while my child, I mean the car,

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.250
continues to pull into the 140s.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.300
No, it's not stock.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.910
Now Tesla made this video
that I've talked about,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.460
and they wanted to showcase the Cyberbeast

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.990
against a Porsche 911.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.250
And they know all of this

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:27.030
so they had to get clever, I'll say.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.890
So if you haven't seen
it, I'll link it below.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.590
Their video shows the Cybertruck
pulling up to the line.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.510
It's racing a Porsche 911.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.400
It beats the 911 in a drag race

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.233
and then it's revealed

00:17:36.233 --> 00:17:38.460
that it was towing a 911 the whole time.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.550
So they're saying you can
beat one while towing one.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.050
And then it flashes the 1/4 mile time

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.670
on the screen, 11 seconds.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.030
So first of all, there's
about 50 different models

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.010
and variations of the Porsche 911.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.660
So just based on what we saw

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.670
and from the performance in
the video, I'm gonna guess

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.230
that they went with the cheapest

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.600
and slowest possible 911.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.770
So that would be the 911 Carrera T.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.180
It's a manual transmission.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.640
It does zero to 60 in around 4.3 seconds.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.850
So now the Cybertruck with
its 2.6 second zero to 60

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.990
has a massive advantage.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.090
And so they're able to handicap it

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.180
by having it tow the
911, like 3,000 pounds.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.800
Okay, so then they run the race.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.230
And if you watch the
video, they run it out

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.080
to this yellow mark right here.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.220
Which it turns out

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.920
is actually the halfway
point of the drag strip.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.300
So shout out to Engineering Explained

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.770
for doing the math on this one.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.060
I'll leave the video below.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.300
But it turns out the Carrera
T, thanks to its gearbox,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.810
is still eventually
faster than a Cybertruck,

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.730
especially if it's towing 3,000 pounds,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.230
but it's really an 1/8 mile race

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.310
that they're showcasing here,

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.890
and then they quote the
1/4 mile time at the end

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.510
as if they ran a 1/4 mile race.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.620
But as we've learned today, quick, fast.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.060
People will point out that difference

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.200
but I'll let it slide.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.400
It's just a drag race, it's fun,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.780
it's not that huge of a deal.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.520
But I will say, if you can,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.100
from stoplight to
stoplight be just as quick

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.093
as basically any other car
in a 7,000 pound truck,

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.660
that's incredible, that's
hilarious, that's really fun.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.580
But hopefully, at least now
you understand why I'm saying

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.620
performance is a bit overrated.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.290
It's more of a one trick
pony in a straight line.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.080
Now that one trick is very fun

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.200
and very appealing to certain people.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.220
There are people every day
who pick the F-150 Raptor

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.680
over the F-150 for stuff like this.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.160
But you know, then you get to
a turn and it's a truck again.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.690
But also one more thing
I just wanna highlight,

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:29.160
again, in our best run
we got 10.995 seconds

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:29.993
in the Cybertruck.

00:19:29.993 --> 00:19:30.930
Is this the fastest?

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:31.920
Is this the world record

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.530
for fastest Cybertruck 1/4 mile?

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.710
I haven't seen any faster,
so lemme know if you do.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.600
But shout out to Miles, the driver mod.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.703
I think we might have a world record here.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.200
All right, the 800 volt architecture

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.820
and the 48 volt low voltage system,

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.203
both new to the Cybertruck.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.970
I'm going underrated, if only
for the fun fact that this,

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:58.500
this is technically the lightest
fully electric pickup truck

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.670
in the world.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.560
Which is not the highest bar to clear.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.990
But yes, thanks to the lesser wire weight,

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.820
it is lighter than the Hummer EV.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.220
It's also lighter than
the F-150 Lightning.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.360
And it is lighter than the
dramatically smaller Rivian R1T.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.710
So that's an accomplishment.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.870
I was also hoping it would charge like,

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.820
just as fast or faster than other Teslas.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.830
But it seems right in line, you know,

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.810
250 kilowatts out of V3 Superchargers

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.330
for about the first 1/3 of the curve.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.240
You know, it looks like less
as far as miles per hour

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.200
that you're adding to the battery,

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.600
but that's including driving efficiency.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.050
Which is, thanks to the
aerodynamics of a refrigerator,

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:34.883
not great.

00:20:34.883 --> 00:20:35.716
Now I also wanna give a shout out

00:20:35.716 --> 00:20:37.440
specifically to the suspension,

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.120
just the suspension on the Cybertruck,

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.560
which I think is underrated.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.690
First of all, there's
a huge amount of travel

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.730
between the lowest and firmest

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.770
and the highest and softest settings.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.780
And no one's gonna say this
thing drives like a sports car,

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.940
but it is pretty impressively low and firm

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.350
in its lowest setting,

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.460
and it's very high,

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.960
and it can move between those low

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.910
and high settings really quickly.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.320
And I was also very impressed

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.440
by how little roll and yaw there was.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.270
Typically a big truck, you hit accelerate

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.650
and the nose comes up a lot.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.440
This one goes up a little.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.273
Not bad.

00:21:08.273 --> 00:21:09.720
But then also we gotta talk
about, just for a second,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.730
Tesla's minimalism.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.060
Because it's kind of a staple
of Teslas at this point,

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.520
especially with the Cybertruck
here with the design.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.640
But also on the inside and with materials

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.380
and the choices they make.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.450
I think a lot of us would agree

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.820
that a physical button in a lot of ways

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.710
is better than a digital button.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.960
I don't think that's a hot take.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.890
But one of the reasons

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.870
Tesla's been so successful business wise

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.420
over the past couple years
in such a competitive market

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.500
is because they've figured out a way

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.270
to make a profit on every vehicle,

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.670
and they minimize all of the extra pieces,

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:42.930
all of the moving parts.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.670
And they've gotten rid
of a lot of buttons.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.050
Actually, they've gotten rid of basically

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.180
every button in the Cybertruck.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.340
But because of Tesla's success,

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.280
I feel like auto manufacturers
have started to copy

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.074
a lot of what Tesla does,

00:21:55.074 --> 00:21:57.660
to the detriment of
some of their vehicles.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.970
I would've liked to have
seen in the Cybertruck,

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.120
this big special vehicle,
maybe a cool key fob

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.730
that has access to a button
to open the front trunk,

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.590
or maybe real climate control buttons.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.470
Or maybe, we all know they
should have done a mirror

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.640
that's actually a screen

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.990
so you can see out the back of the truck

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.760
without looking down at the screen.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.080
But they didn't do that.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.340
So I'm saying Tesla's minimalism,
kind of overrated here.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.720
But I also do need you to know

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.510
that despite all the other
interesting technical stuff

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.430
that I've talked about in this video,

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:29.460
this is still a Tesla under the hood,

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.440
and all of the things
that we love about that

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.570
and all the other stuff
that comes with it.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.400
That means it works
with Tesla Superchargers

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.630
all over the country.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.670
That also means it has a super heavy

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.430
123 kilowatt-hour battery in the floor.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.620
It means that the quiet
interior of the vehicle

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.050
makes the speaker system sound way better

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.250
than it probably should.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.750
And it also means a bunch of things

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.480
are missing about these early
trucks as they deliver them.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.150
The super heavy additional
range extender battery

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.800
in the back isn't shipping yet,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.330
and nobody knows when it will.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.970
The screen also has no
CarPlay or Android Auto,

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.720
but the software is really
good and super fast.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.240
But there's also no Autopilot right now,

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.500
even if you paid for it.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.900
No light bar right now,
even if you paid for it.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.690
No aero caps right now,
and you did pay for those.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.060
The locking differential at
the rear axle doesn't work

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.100
in the dual motor version
of this truck yet.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.860
And there's only one
tire option, for a truck!

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.230
All of these are
decisions that Tesla makes

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.680
knowing the priorities
of the probable buyers,

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.140
the millions of pre-orders
of the Cybertruck.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.930
They know what people are
probably going to do with these.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.330
They know what people think
they're going to do with these.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.800
And they know what people want

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.690
when they buy one of these things.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:37.950
It's a Tesla under the hood.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.480
So I was driving to the
studio the other day,

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.180
and on my way there I'm
coming up over this hill,

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.620
and on the other side of the hill

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.900
is this biker across the street.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.610
And as I came over the hill, he looked up

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.800
and he saw the truck
for about two seconds.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.275
And then he reached out
and he just did this

00:23:52.275 --> 00:23:54.900
as he biked past me.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.550
But later that same night,

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.200
I was on my way home from practice

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.720
around the bridge somewhere
in New York City at night.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.640
And slowing down in traffic,

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.100
this car pulls up next to
me, kind of in front of me

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.260
and all four of the windows roll down

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.900
and these super happy faces all stick out

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.090
and just like, give me thumbs up

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.890
and they're grinning the entire time.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.040
And I'd say that's about the ratio of joy

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.510
to absolute disgust

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.980
that you bring into the world

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.650
driving the Cybertruck around,
it's probably like 80-20.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.530
So what's the verdict with
the Cybertruck, right?

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.680
I think there's a lot going
on between those four corners,

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.430
a lot of interesting choices
and materials and technologies

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.120
and steer by wire and 800 volt
systems and all this stuff.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.120
But a lot of it frankly is
overshadowed by the design again.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.960
So we keep coming back to the design.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.283
And I feel like we can use
that word again, iconic.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.530
I would say as a product person,

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.640
I do think this is
already an iconic design.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.560
Now, that comes with a lot of baggage.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.150
I feel like when you say that word,

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.220
it's kind of like joining the rare air

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.540
of like, the bedroom poster
of some on some kid's wall.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.500
It's like the Lamborghini
Countach or the Bugatti Veyron

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.960
or something like a Tesla Cybertruck.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.051
But the thing about those iconic cars

00:25:13.051 --> 00:25:17.043
is they're also almost always rare.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.040
And that's the thing, it's like
if you saw a Bugatti Veyron

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.500
on the street, that's probably
the only Bugatti Veyron

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.480
you're gonna see on the
street for a long time.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.150
There's not that many
Lamborghini Countaches

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:27.990
out on the world.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:31.350
Now the Cybertruck today is super rare.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.970
And there's all these
articles about, you know,

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.560
celebrities driving them around.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.750
And when you see one, it's an event.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.700
That's why people are
reacting the way they are.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.590
It's probably because it's the first time

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:41.940
they're ever seeing one.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:46.740
But the Cybertruck is
slotted to be mass produced.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.220
So I feel like this actually
has to wear off after a while.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.690
Like obviously it hits different

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.890
seeing your 10th or 50th

00:25:54.125 --> 00:25:56.460
or 100th Cybertruck of the day, right?

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.320
So how does that match up?

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.170
I think there's like, two
million plus pre-orders

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.117
of the Cybertruck, and more coming.

00:26:03.117 --> 00:26:04.440
There were only ever

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.950
about 2000 Lamborghini
Countaches ever made.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.880
There was less than 500
Bugatti Veyrons ever made.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.460
So it's kinda hard to
find a comp for a vehicle

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.970
that starts off its life as iconic,

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.590
but then is mass produced.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.880
And there was this really
interesting comment

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.920
on the Auto Focus video
I made about this truck

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.700
on owning the PT Cruiser
when it first came out.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.560
And I wasn't really old
enough to remember this,

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.000
so I'm purely taking their word for it,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.970
but it apparently it was
a crazy enough design

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.410
that it got a lot of attention

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:35.880
when it first started being made.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.610
You know, it's a weird shape,
had some odd material choices

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:39.660
and all that.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.710
But eventually Chrysler made
over a million PT cruisers.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.790
But now we know exactly
how cool the PT Cruiser is.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.500
You know, it gets humanized more and more

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.880
the more you see them on the road.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.070
You see them get in accidents

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.690
and have to maneuver through traffic,

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.120
and they're just regular
people and regular cars,

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.860
and they're everywhere.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.070
And I guess the question
is, is that the arc

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.450
for the Tesla Cybertruck?

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.283
Like, we don't know.

00:27:04.283 --> 00:27:07.140
But it has to go from being
this crazy unobtainium

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.773
that it is right now, to being something.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.233
Only time will tell.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.810
Thanks for watching.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.520
Catch you guys in the next one.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.353
Peace.

00:27:19.452 --> 00:27:22.202
(rhythmic music)
