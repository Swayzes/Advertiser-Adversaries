00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:04.170
This is a $250 million private
island.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.141
Literally, anything you could ever
want is on this island.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.709
And I'm going to show you
the difference

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.880
between this and a $150
million luxury island,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.052
a massive $45 million island,
a $5 million frozen island

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:22.188
all the way down to the cheapest
private island in the world.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.291
That thing I'm starting to realize
might not all fit on it.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.228
First step on my brand new island.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.462
Here's your dollar.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.130
Thank you, sir.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.065
- Thank you for selling it to me.
- It's yours now, buddy.

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.466
Let's check out
what I just bought.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.701
My first impressions

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.336
is that it's a lot smaller than I thought.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:37.337
When you pay a dollar,

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.839
you get a random pile of bricks,
an old toilet.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:40.807
I found the restroom.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.776
And a bunch of random wooden poles.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.677
There's more poles than
square feet on this thing.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.879
They're actually called pylons.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.280
Let's pile onto that boat and leave.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.750
And as you can see, there's nothing
here, so I'm going to blow it up.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:55.755
But later in this video,
we're going to a $150 million island

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.192
and also a quarter
billion dollar super island.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.962
But first, we're going to head over
to the $1 million dollar island called

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:03.696
Monkey Island.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.632
Yes, you heard me right.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:09.135
This island is literally swarmed
with hundreds of monkeys.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.171
I can see why it's called
Monkey Island.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.539
- What's this monkey?
- It's Odie.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.307
Odie took my orange.

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:15.041
Okay.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.376
Monkey see food, monkey take.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.644
All the monkeys on this island

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.746
have a strategy
for interacting with people.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.181
They gaslight you into thinking

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.283
that you're friends,
and then they steal your food.

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:24.384
You can have it.
You can have it.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.718
I love this monkey.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.320
There's a monkey on the boat.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.588
And if you're wondering
where are you

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.590
and your friends are going to sleep
on this island,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.561
Suspended above the water are six
luxury cabanas, which house

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.329
both humans and monkeys.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.264
The monkey's grabbing the GoPro, Jimmy.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.266
Sir, we need this for filming.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.602
I just need to borrow this.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.204
Thank you. Okay.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.872
I got my camera back.
You want... Oops.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.341
He wants your hat.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.043
Okay, you can have that, sir.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:51.377
By the end of this,
I'm going to be naked.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:52.645
The monkeys are stealing everything.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.381
And the monkeys are not even
the coolest part of this island.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:58.318
See, this island isn't
even an island at all.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:01.821
It's actually the top of a massive
underwater plant network

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:04.090
that emerged from the sand and water

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.026
to create this illusion of an island
that we see today.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:10.163
Is this a milion dollar island
or a million dollar bush?

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.931
- Because there's no land.
- What do you think?

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.299
I don't know.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.801
I think an island
is what you make of it.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.805
And on the other side of the island,
there's even a private relaxation area

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:20.440
And a beachfront massage parlor.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.107
Nolan!

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.475
I'm trying not to fall in the water.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.744
I'm about to get a massage
with a monkey.

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:25.612
That's really cool.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.514
Notice how all the water
around you is freezing.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.214
What?

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:29.048
That took a lot of effort.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.950
And we put that much effort in
to convey

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.052
that the $5 million Island
is very cool.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:36.589
And where we're going next,
most of the year looks like this,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.858
but it's going to look like this.

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:39.459
No joke.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.695
This island is so cold right now
that the lake surrounding it

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.698
is actually frozen solid,
which means to get there,

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.734
we're going to be using
an interesting vehicule.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:48.868
We're literally hovering.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:49.235
Yeah.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.971
Apparently snowmobiles would have
been too basic for this island.

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.873
It just had to be hovercrafts.

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:54.908
This is awesome.

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.276
Talking about arriving in fashion.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.877
And it only took about 30 seconds

00:02:57.877 --> 00:03:00.580
being outside the hovercraft
for the gang to be frozen solid.

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.916
- How cold is it?
- It's zero degrees celsius.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:03.683
It's pretty cold, man

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.084
He’s more like a 70 guy.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:06.653
So, they hurried over

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.722
to these futuristic
self-heating huts to stay warm.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.124
Oh, this is so small.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.326
Wait, there's no
room for you in here.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.160
We're gonna have to cuddle then.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.230
And these huts are able to stay here
completely year round

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.300
because they're able to both float
on warm, peaceful lake water.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.569
But they also do
just fine in the dead of winter.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.770
But at least in the winter,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.672
you get a great view
of the northern lights.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.074
For $5 million, you basically
get a winter wonderland.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:29.509
And while staying on this island,

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.011
you're given unlimited
five star food.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.546
I think he thinks we speak Finnish.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:40.086
And even though this island comes
with a luxury cabin to stay in.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:43.456
Oh, this is beautiful.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.524
Fine, I'll take it.

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.491
Jimmy, buy it for me.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.561
The gang ended up spending
most of their time on the frozen lake

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:51.264
where they were able to ride
an actual dog sled.

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:53.099
He took your glove.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:54.701
Oh my Gosh!

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:55.969
This is the best island.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.570
I don't know how
any island is going to beat this.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.272
Maybe one where I could feel my hands.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:02.809
And Karl's hands are in luck
because this next island is not only warm

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:05.945
but more expensive
than all of the other islands combined.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:09.782
This island is tiny,
but arguably one of the most

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:11.551
luxurious ones out there.

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:13.086
Okay, let's go check the house.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:15.455
Feast!

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.357
We're stoked to have you
as our guest.

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.659
We hope you have a blast.
Just don't break anything.

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.361
Yo, we should try to break one thing.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.964
Oh, nice bathroom.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:29.269
Usually rich people like showers that
can fit like 30 to 1000 people in them.

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:31.170
This time,
they chose a reasonable shower.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.972
When you pay $16 million

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:35.808
in addition to a shower,
that's the size of the $1 island,

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.011
the private island comes
with this helicopter

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:40.113
that's apparently too
big for this island.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.014
We have jet skis.

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.549
We have a submarine.
Another submarine to the right.

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.451
We have a shark submarine
over there.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.320
There's almost a submarine
for each of us.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.955
Boys, do whatever you want.
Have fun. You're out. You

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:50.456
Yeah! Yeah!

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:52.825
I’m going really fast.

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:56.996
I love private islands.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.798
Karl, if you had one wish,
what would it be?

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.366
To get off of this thing!

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.901
Yeah!

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:06.406
We're underwater!

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:07.674
I am a fish now.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.377
After Ludwig and Karl kissed
the sea at 500 miles per hour,

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.581
we went back to shore
to take a little breather.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.316
Yeah.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.384
Ludwig's
going to jump out of a helicopter.

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:19.185
He really is.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.020
No, wait, I'm not...
Wait, what?

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:24.657
Any last words?

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.893
I love you, Mom.
I'm sorry.

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:27.727
This helicopter

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:29.829
is taking the boys
up into the air

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:32.832
and letting them jump and
freefall into the ocean.

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:34.467
Oh, my God.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.336
This is crazy.
We shouldn't be doing this.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.237
This is only a $16 million island,

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:39.939
and we're jumping out of a helicopter.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.743
He's about to jump.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.012
Oh my Gosh!

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:49.148
Oh wait! They jump!

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.851
There he goes.

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:58.157
Whoever said money doesn't buy
happiness,

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:01.661
doesn't own that private island,
because I'm pretty happy.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.498
And now the $45 million island,

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.835
this island is so big,
you can't even fit it all in frame.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.637
Oh, hey, I didn't realize
they were waiting on us.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:12.238
- Hi!
- Hi!

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:14.540
I always feel uncomfortable
when I pull up to places

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.976
and people are just standing
potentially for hours waiting on me.

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:18.177
Hello!

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.979
We have some blueberry smoothies
here.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:20.880
Is it alcoholic?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.848
No, it's not.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:22.849
He's not 21

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.852
now we'll take you guys up
and we'll show you around Royal Island

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:26.552
a little bit.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.020
Let's see what
$45 million gets us.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:29.489
It's a long path.

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.290
The path is longer than
the last island.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.059
For $45 million,

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:35.461
this island comes with
a mansion and its own

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:37.663
beachside bar and private chef.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.899
- Can I give it a flip?
- Sure.

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:41.134
That's not too bad.

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:43.236
And outside of the
mansion is a hot tub

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:45.638
overlooking the
cove where the jet skis are

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:49.008
and of course, a pool
with the best view I've ever seen.

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:51.210
Does this look as cool on camera
as it does in real life?

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.579
And if for some reason, you
don't want to stay in the mansion,

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:56.916
there's five luxury beachside cabanas
you can pick from.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.151
Jimmy, may I?

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.085
You may.

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:00.686
May I?

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.254
You may.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.488
I have class.

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.558
But even after messing around
with all of the amenities.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:07.460
Why are we playing ping pong
when we have an entire island?

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.463
It's important to note that that's
not what makes this island special.

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:11.931
All the way at the other end of

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:15.468
the island are century-old ruins
that we are yet to explore.

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:16.369
Dibs on driving.

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:17.136
Oh, no.

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:18.271
All right, ready?

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.338
Yeah.

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:21.007
We're going to go off
roading a little bit

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.175
and head to the back
of the island now.

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.709
How does Karl
always end up driving?

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:25.044
- Because I'm awesome.
- Big bump!

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.547
Dude, this is like a safari.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.449
Yeah, you're going four times
the speed limit.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.350
 I mean, I don't know if
there's cops that will stop you,

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:32.118
but I'm just letting you know.

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:33.753
Is there a jail on this island?

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:34.454
No Jail.

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:35.121
Oh there's no jail?

00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:37.490
And when we finally ran out of road
to drive on,

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:39.025
we started to make our way through

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:40.726
what used to be a village of people

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:42.962
on this island,
over a hundred years ago.

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:44.497
- This used to be a bar?
- Yes

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.366
You want to walk under this
100-year-old giant thousand-pound slab?

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.402
Sure, surely it won't fall
on top of me.

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:51.904
Dude, if today was the day that it'd fell,
you couldn't even be mad.

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:53.139
Nolan, come over here before you die.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:57.543
And just past the ruins is easily
the best view on the entire island.

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:00.513
Yeah, it gets better.

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:01.948
We were driving for so long.

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.950
I forgot we were on an island.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.053
The island starts over there, comes
all the way around,

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:08.387
wraps all the way around here.

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.890
Goes down that coastline
all the way up over there.

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:11.791
I'll be honest, I wouldn't

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:15.094
pay $45 million for a big jungle
with some ancient ruins.

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.362
But I'm sure some rich guy will.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:20.166
This next island is arguably
the second most expensive island

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.334
that money can buy.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.971
This is the $150 million island.

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:27.673
It comes with eight
luxurious mega mansions.

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:28.741
And the best part is

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:32.478
it is completely powered
by solar panels and wind turbines.

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:36.015
It's home to some of the most
exotic animals I've ever seen,

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:38.851
and took over four decades to build.

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:41.821
This island will literally blow your mind.

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.190
When I think of a private island,
this is what I think of.

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:46.259
That's good,
because this is a private island.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:46.726
All right.

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:50.196
And apparently the first thing you
need to do here is wash your hands.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.865
Make sure you don't taint the
island with your outside world germs.

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:54.233
I've already
washed my germs.

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:56.035
Does everyone who come here
gets a coconut?

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.703
I mean, they're not running low.

00:08:57.904 --> 00:08:58.471
True.

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:01.173
I don't know if it's
because this place is so fancy.

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:03.376
Or maybe they just
heard about Karl's driving,

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:04.310
Yeah!

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:07.113
But each of us ended up
with our own personal driver.

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:09.782
I have a feeling this is going to be
a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:12.184
- Unless you come back.
- That might be out of my price range.

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:15.388
And even though this island costs
$150 million,

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.290
you can actually rent it yourself,

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.360
for the extremely low price
of 140 grand per day.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.162
I didn't even realize
we just went up a mountain.

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:25.665
I've heard this is the most
luxurious private island in the world.

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:26.332
It is.

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.568
- The view is insane.
- This is the great house.

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:29.835
But before we were able

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:34.340
to explore the great house, my dumb
friends got distracted by a turtle.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.408
There's a turtle?

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:36.309
Get in there.

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.244
Yeah.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.246
All right, you guys
go to the rest of the island.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.316
This island is so extra
that for every one person

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:46.886
in your party, they have ten staff
members waiting on your every need.

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:49.322
There's a bunch of people over there
like here's drinks, here's food.

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:51.057
What do you want to do
over the next few days?

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:52.224
And we're just like "turtle".

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:54.193
And of course,

00:09:54.193 --> 00:09:57.363
Nolan, of all my friends
wanted to take advantage of this.

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:58.831
Yes! Yeah!

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:01.567
What's everyone up to over here?

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:02.368
We're playing pool.

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:03.569
With 10 people?

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:04.403
They're my hype crew.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.172
You don't have to hang out
with him to make him feel good.

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:08.574
I will be sad
if you don't sit down and relax.

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:11.210
If you need attention,
don't make them stand there.

00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:13.012
It's only been an hour,
but I'll say it.

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:14.347
This is the best island so far.

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:15.481
On top of all of that,

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:18.551
the island has a house
with a driving range on the roof

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:21.387
where you can literally hit
golf balls into the ocean.

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:23.255
Because these are made of fish food.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.128
You should probably hit it
further so you don't hit someone.

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.064
Look at all those flamingos.
There's so much I can't process it.

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:33.933
Flamingos in the sky.

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:35.101
They are everywhere.

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:37.503
They don't love us
unless we give them food.

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:40.106
Come here, my brethren.

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:43.242
But flamingos aren't the only
exotic animals on this island.

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:45.711
- Bro.
- That's a dinosaur.

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:47.813
This is so cool.

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:48.781
And believe it or not,

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:52.318
this turtle could theoretically
live over 200 years.

00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:54.353
Mr. Tortoise, my name is Jimmy.

00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:56.389
If my descendants, descendants,
descendants come here.

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:57.690
Tell them I was awesome.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.424
And afterwards,

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:00.993
we got swarmed by a bunch of lemurs
that live on this island over here.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.827
Get over here!

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:03.729
Jimmy, I don't know if you noticed
that there's two lemurs on your head.

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:04.997
Yeah, I know.
I'm trying not to move...

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:06.832
- I'll put food on there.
- Please don't.

00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:09.935
And if you're wondering where
all these exotic animals came from,

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:13.839
most of them, sadly, are endangered
species and are all on this island

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:14.774
because the owner,

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:17.777
Richard Branson, brought all of them
here to help prevent them

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:18.711
from going extinct.

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:20.646
But the most endangered
animal on the island

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:22.548
were the mermaids
that serve you sushi.

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:23.549
Yeah!

00:11:23.582 --> 00:11:25.351
Mermaids and sushi.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.719
This is luxury.

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:27.520
Mermaids!

00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:29.455
- Do you guys want sushi?
- I wouldn't say no.

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.489
Is that cannibalism?

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:31.257
Yes.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.259
It's like a family reunion.
Get over here.

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:35.161
There's honestly
so much on this island.

00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:36.529
We can't even film it all.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.664
We play tennis, we play basketball.

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:40.900
We explore yet another mansion.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.535
I did my first cold plunge.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.402
You get the idea.

00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:44.837
There's
so much to do on this island.

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:46.639
It's actually overwhelming.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:47.873
This one's actually pretty intense.

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.408
I'm like actually scared.

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:51.277
- You know what else is intense?
- What?

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.212
The final island.
I'll see you there.

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:54.980
Why are we still here?

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.018
And on the way to the $250
million Island,

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:02.755
we stopped in shark infested waters
because I have to pay for this video.

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:04.490
And now
that I'm surrounded by sharks

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:07.793
and what
feels like my worst nightmare,

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:09.195
I'm going to tell you guys,
about Stumble Guys.

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.129
Bro, they're so close.

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:10.730
Oh, my gosh.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.599
And the worst part is I'm not
coming out until I'm done with this ad

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:16.268
Stumble Guys is a free-to-play
mobile player game

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:18.604
where 32 people compete
for the crown.

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:20.673
You have to be an absolute maniac
to do this.

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:22.708
Not even Stumble Guys
could pay me to do this.

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:24.376
Why are you all here, sharks?

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:26.912
They're so close,
they're so close.

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:28.047
And for their new season

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.349
they went all out with the new
MrBeast skins,

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:31.584
animations and emotes.

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:33.486
Okay, square head, have it...

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:34.553
Bro, this is nuts.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.555
I want to make sure
there's enough sharks for Jimmy.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.357
They also added a brand new level,

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:41.060
but you have to follow a pattern
as long as possible to stay alive.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.162
And the longer you live,
the harder it gets.

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:44.497
Is a shark hitting me?

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.732
I think the sharks are hitting the cage.
It's rocking!

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:47.833
Oh, this is scary.

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:48.400
Not only that,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.204
I also just released my new toolkit
so you can build your own MrBeast level.

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:53.839
This is one of their best seasons ever.

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:57.042
You need to try my new MrBeast level,
plus build your own.

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:59.044
And I want
to see what you guys come up with.

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:01.781
The sharks keep hitting the cage.
So I'm going to get out of here.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.549
Make sure to download
Stumble Guys for free

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:05.151
so I don't have to go back
in the shark cage.

00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:06.519
You're alive.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:08.420
Let's go do more things that have
nothing to do with sharks.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:08.821
Please.

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:12.258
And now that I've paid off the debt
I've incurred from this video,

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:16.095
let's visit the $250 million island.

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:20.299
This is a $250 million
private island.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:24.336
This extraordinary island
has an entire amusement park

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:26.772
with over a dozen waterslides.

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:30.843
It also has its own hot air balloon
and just about every activity

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:31.644
you could imagine.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.046
And we have it all to ourselves.

00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:37.449
There are no other guests here,
but out of every feature you've seen

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:40.953
on these islands so far,
this one stands above the rest.

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:44.456
In the middle of the island
is a massive waterslide,

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.293
even though literally eight year
olds ride that waterslide,

00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:49.261
I might still chicken out
because I'm afraid of heights.

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:50.963
But before taking on the water
slide,

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:53.632
we checked out the other features,
like how there's over

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:55.835
a hundred jetskis on this island.

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:57.236
It's a bit overkill.

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:58.137
And not to mention

00:13:58.137 --> 00:14:02.241
there's a literal zip lines
that span across manmade beaches.

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:03.275
What's the helmet for?

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:04.109
What am I going to hit?

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.277
The ground, bro.

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.012
Because sometimes people fall off.

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.681
- This is like really scary.
- Yeah.

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.583
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:12.451
Karl, you're kind of far behind.

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:13.819
This is awesome.

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:16.922
This is actually not that crazy.

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:20.659
And if you own this island,
you can host over 13,000

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:24.730
of your friends at any of these
five gargantuan pools.

00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:27.833
Oh, this kind of looks like
it was made in Minecraft.

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:30.302
And it's so funny
just seeing my two friends in it.

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:32.538
Nolan looks like a tiny speck.

00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:34.740
For $250 million,

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.076
this island,
of course, has exotic animals.

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.177
Is that a peacock?

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:40.012
Sir, I need to take
you in for questioning.

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:41.113
Sir?

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.515
And even every game you can imagine,

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:47.386
I wish there is the 13,000 people
that are normally here,

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:48.821
to watch how bad he is at Cornhole.

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.189
Is that soccer pool?

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:52.625
This island has things
I didn't even know existed.

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:55.794
But something I noticed is
there were way too many lifeguards

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.897
at this island
for just the four of us.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.465
How many lifeguards
are on this island?

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:01.033
- Over 100
- Really?

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:03.402
With this many lifeguards,
you would have to try to drown.

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:06.138
So I thought it'd be fun
if we gave them all the day off.

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:08.307
Has anyone ever rented
this island before?

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:09.008
No one.

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.043
- This is the first.
- Dude, you are leaning back.

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:12.244
You look way too relaxed.

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:14.680
And after all 100 lifeguards went down,

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:17.716
they decided to hype up
the boys and I for our turn on the slide.

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:20.352
Here we go!

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:24.189
Oh my Gosh!

00:15:24.223 --> 00:15:26.258
Boys, you want to know
what's even scarier than that?

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:27.192
What?

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:28.060
That one.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.428
Why is it so terrifying tonight?

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:31.030
It looks so scary.

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:33.632
We can skip it.

00:15:33.632 --> 00:15:37.436
Towering at over 135 feet tall.

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:40.940
This is the tallest water
slide in all of North America.

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:43.108
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:44.343
It's like a skyscraper.

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:45.644
But I'm scared.

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:48.113
Daredevil's Peak.
What a soothing name.

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:49.148
Very inviting.

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:50.516
We're so up.

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:51.817
It's kind of freaking me out.

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:53.652
All right, we made it to the top.

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.020
Are you guys just waiting for us up
here?

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:56.155
Yeah.

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:58.290
Listen
to how intense the wind is up here.

00:15:58.424 --> 00:15:59.625
Oh, don't look down.

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.027
Look how crazy the island
looks. Oh, my God.

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:03.395
- Karl!
- No.

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:04.563
Nolan! Oh!

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:06.365
Would you say nose goes is enforceable?

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:08.334
Nose goes is enforceable.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.468
There we go!

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.370
The lifeguards said you got to go, Nolan.

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:12.604
I love you, Mom.

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:14.139
I'll see you on the other side.

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:14.940
All right, go.

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:17.343
Oh my God!

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:21.180
Oh, I got hit by a truck.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.481
Let's do this.

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:24.917
You better come down after me.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:25.684
Okay.

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:27.786
Oh, God.

00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:29.288
Why is it so fast?

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:31.123
Is it actually that scary?

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.362
I'm going to do this
for your entertainment,

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:38.630
even though giant rides scare me.

00:16:39.898 --> 00:16:40.799
Here we go.

00:16:41.967 --> 00:16:43.702
That is going so fast.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.205
And even though
I was basically just drowning

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:48.340
the entire time down this waterslide,

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:51.076
I gotta say this whole island
was pretty awesome.
