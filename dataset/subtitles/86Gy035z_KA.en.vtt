00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.240
- I actually love this thing.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.520
I love this thing, not because
it's flawless or anything,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.239
it is far from flawless,

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:10.380
but because it's actually interesting.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.900
Like, don't forget the
last two, three years

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.769
of Apple Product review comments are just,

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.030
"That's boring, oh, it's just a spec bump,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.440
there's nothing really new here,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.790
oh, they hardly change anything

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.280
or try anything new these days."

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.190
But this, this thing is interesting.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.100
It's risky, and most of all, it's new.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.740
Now, it's actually not fundamentally new,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.440
it's a VR headset, but it's new for Apple.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.360
And there are a bunch of things in here

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.480
that are new in a way
that only Apple would try.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.290
And just as interesting
as this individual product

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.220
is the possible future that this implies.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.650
Like, when you get a first
generation product like this,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.690
you sort of automatically assume

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.850
that there are goals for its future,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.620
that it'll have another generation

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.970
and another one after that,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.050
and that there is some goal

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.140
for what this will turn
into 10 years down the road

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.750
because we saw what
happened with the iPhone

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.610
and the Mac and the iPad

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.800
and all sorts of other
first generation products.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.910
And on top of all of that, as
far as I know, Apple has never

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.670
released any other
first generation product

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.700
with the word Pro already in the name,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.220
which comes with a whole
nother set of implications.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.479
So is the world ready for all of this?

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.089
Let's get into it.

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:28.672
(upbeat music)

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.030
So I might be one of the
20 people outside of Apple

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.400
who has been using the Vision Pro

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.200
the most over the past two weeks.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.470
Like, I've spent hours in
this thing with both bands,

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.770
with multiple Macs, in different
setups, different rooms,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.100
indoors and outdoors,
lightness and darkness.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.030
There are parts of this thing
that are absolutely amazing,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.920
unparalleled, best I've ever seen.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.530
But the reason it's so interesting

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.450
is because it's actually new

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.110
and there are downfalls
and flaws and trade-offs

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.180
that come alongside all of this stuff.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.710
So at the end of the last video,

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.480
I gave you guys a sort of a preview

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.190
of my pros and cons list.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.200
If you haven't already watched that video,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.730
it is definitely worth watching,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.200
almost like a prequel to this one.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.950
It is a 30 minute monster all
about how to use this thing,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.310
how it works, what's inside,
what it's capable of.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.050
And then, at the end, I got to my upsides,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.110
which are immersiveness,
placement and space,

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.000
eye tracking and hand control,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.900
passthrough, ecosystem, and spatial audio.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.990
And the downsides, which
are weight and comfort,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.670
the eyes on the outside,

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.540
app selection right now,
battery life, and price.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.830
So, okay, for starters,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.280
I wanna amend immersiveness to fidelity,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.630
I think that's more accurate here.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.900
I have used a bunch of
different VR headsets now,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.050
and this Vision Pro has the sharpest,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.050
best looking micro-OLED
display out of all of them.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.270
The size of individual
pixels on these displays

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.070
is seven and a half microns,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.890
which means you could fit 64 of them

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.530
in the size of a single
iPhone screen's pixel.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.970
You can't see individual pixels,

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.360
there's no screen door
effect, it's awesome.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.250
The native refresh rate is 90 hertz

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.230
and it will crank up to 96 hertz

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.440
when there's 24 FPS content
playing to be an even multiple.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.660
And Apple says that they calibrate

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.210
every single one of
these Vision Pro displays

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.934
from the factory for
maximum color accuracy.

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:34.290
They're really good,

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.070
and this is a big reason why
this headset is so expensive.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.590
But then, and this is gonna
be a recurring theme here,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.590
the Vision Pro runs up against
the technology of today

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.060
not being quite advanced enough

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.800
to accomplish what they were
probably hoping as ideal.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.540
So in the case of these screens, right,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.420
they're amazing, there are so many pixels,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.920
but because there's so many pixels,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.410
the computer inside cannot
actually render everything

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.810
in high resolution all
the time at 90 Hertz.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.030
So instead, it does something clever.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.120
It combines the insanely fast eye tracking

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.310
with what's called foveated rendering,

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.220
meaning, it's only actually
rendering in high resolution

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.820
exactly what you're looking
at when you're looking at it.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.010
The rest is soft and fuzzy.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.150
That actually works really well

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.860
because that's exactly how our eyes work.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.720
It's really clever, like
you don't think about it,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.420
but the thing that you're looking
at at the moment is sharp,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.460
but then the rest of
your peripheral vision

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.440
is soft and fuzzy, and that's fine.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.500
So really, now, all of the
computing work is being done

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.170
to track your eyes as fast as possible

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.910
so that there's no lag between

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.860
when you look at something
and when it becomes sharp.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.660
Fun fact, you can actually see this

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.240
in screen recordings from the Vision Pro.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.650
You can see the piece of the screen

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.060
that I'm looking at is sharp,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.200
and then everything else around it,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.580
even parts of the same
window are fuzzy on purpose.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.380
But to my eye, that looks totally natural

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.540
because I'm focusing
on one thing at a time.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.770
I found that you can also screen record

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.680
with developer mode in Xcode,
and that'll make the clips 4K

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.230
and it'll render everything
in HQ all at once.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.910
But every time I did that,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.630
it would be choppy and scrolling
would be slow and jittery.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.830
And I'm thinking that's just because

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.680
the computers aren't really
used to rendering everything

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.820
in high quality all the time.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.380
So it looks like a
higher quality recording,

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.660
but the second I did any
scrolling, it didn't look as good,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.300
so I just didn't use
those recordings as often.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.680
So the screens are great,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.340
the position tracking of
objects and space are great,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.930
the eye tracking is incredibly good.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.030
The one ding against immersion
on the Vision Pro though,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.500
and not a lot of people
are talking about this,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.480
but it's the field of view.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.610
See, the first few times
you use this headset,

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.680
you don't even really
think about it that much.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.530
You're so distracted by
all the fun and the newness

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.470
and how cool it is that your
eyes are controlling the thing.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.630
But eventually, you start
to poke around the edges

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.490
and it turns out, you
know how people are saying

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.040
it kind of looks like ski
goggles from the outside?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.690
Well, it also kind of
looks like ski goggles

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.430
from the inside a little bit too.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.910
Again, the middle is super
sharp and incredibly impressive,

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.160
but if I can do my best here
through a YouTube video,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.580
the edges of the headset
are a little bit further in

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.020
than the edges of your vision.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.900
And so, there's a little bit
of like a cone effect going on

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.850
and there's some chromatic
aberration around the outside.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.010
So you kind of have this slight feeling

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.890
of looking into a large
tunnel at everything.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.330
There are actually no
field of view numbers

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.070
published by Apple
anywhere about Vision Pro,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.330
as far as I can tell,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.620
and I kind of think that's on purpose

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.300
because I have noticed
from using them both

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.050
that the Quest 3 has a
better, wider field of view

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.400
just looking inside the headset.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.590
So if I could change one
thing about the Vision Pro

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.330
to make it more immersive,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.525
it would be a wider field
of view, no question.

00:06:36.525 --> 00:06:39.108
(upbeat music)

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.070
Vision Pro has the best
passthrough of any headset

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.800
I've ever used, that much
is super clear to me,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.940
and weirdly enough,

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.860
this doesn't actually surprise me either.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.210
Maybe because this is one of the products

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.100
that makes it so obvious

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.570
that they're thinking
a lot about the future,

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.610
like Apple talks a lot about AR

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.100
and how they want things to just be clear

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.653
and just overlaying things
onto your real world.

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:03.450
But with today's technology,

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.640
again, that's not quite possible yet.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.740
So instead they have a VR headset,

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.040
but they are using the highest
quality camera feeds possible

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.280
and the highest quality
displays on the inside possible

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.090
to let you almost feel like

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.190
you're looking through
it at the real world.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.450
So you put this headset on,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.210
and the first thing
you see is passthrough,

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.220
I mean, you might as well
call it transparency mode.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.350
And the sharpness and the colors

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.930
and the very low latency are all so good

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.780
that I really don't
experience any eye fatigue,

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.110
no matter how long I am
in this passthrough mode,

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.510
despite my eyes being
inches from these screens,

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.550
I can interact with the
real world around me,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.230
pick things up and look at them,

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.530
I can walk around, between
rooms and not trip on things.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.510
I tried having people throw things at me

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.100
and I could just catch them.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.470
I played table tennis
successfully with the headset on,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.060
which is crazy if you think about

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.410
what's actually happening here.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.460
The total latency Apple
says is 12 milliseconds,

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.610
that's from the outside light
hitting the outside sensors

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.267
to the inside image being updated
and hitting your eyeballs,

00:08:06.267 --> 00:08:08.520
that's incredibly fast,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.663
and that includes the
exposure time of the cameras.

00:08:10.663 --> 00:08:14.445
That's the specially
designed R1 chip at work.

00:08:14.445 --> 00:08:17.490
But, as Nilay from The Verge has put it,

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.910
it's still cameras and screens,

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.670
like the technology of today isn't magic.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.100
So you still have to
expose a camera sensor

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.220
and set ISO and shutter speed, et cetera,

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.140
and you can kind of play
around with this a bit

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.498
just by looking around
like at bright objects

00:08:33.498 --> 00:08:35.705
or high dynamic range environments.

00:08:35.705 --> 00:08:36.990
And you know what,

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.540
for the variety of situations
I've thrown at this thing,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.510
it's handled it very
impressively the whole time,

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.360
mostly prioritizing smoothness
and high shutter speeds

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.670
at the expense of cranking up the ISO

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.260
and getting way more noise,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.880
especially in darker environments.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.960
But you can still see stuff

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.330
like the hand occlusion breaks sometimes

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.830
or look really janky
when you put your hand

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.760
in front of something.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.960
You can still see objects start
to float a little bit more

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.480
in X, Y, and Z space when
you're in much lower lighting,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.580
as opposed to the usual perfect position.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.384
Again, it's the best I've
ever seen with today's tech,

00:09:09.384 --> 00:09:11.631
but it definitely still
has a long way to go.

00:09:11.631 --> 00:09:15.030
(upbeat music)

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.810
So honestly, the
ecosystem is, I would say,

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.780
the strongest argument
for a regular person

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.893
going out and buying today's
version of the Vision Pro.

00:09:25.893 --> 00:09:29.640
Like, every time a new big
product comes out or whatever,

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.937
I get like texts from people,

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:32.340
"Oh hey, Marques, you know,

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.770
I know you already made like
a 30 minute video about it

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.090
and like unboxed it and did all that,

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.810
but like what do you really
think about the Vision Pro?

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.837
Like, is it good enough?
Should I get one?"

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.710
And, truthfully, probably not.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.200
But I will say that there
are a good amount of things

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.020
that I do specifically look
forward to using for it,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.780
and most of those things
are ecosystem related.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.030
So obviously there's the
built-in apps, right?

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.680
iMessage works perfectly,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.320
just like any iPhone or
iPad on your account,

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.440
photos are all loaded up in
here straight from your iPhone.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.850
This is clearly the headset

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.360
that is best for iPhone
users, Apple ecosystem people,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.540
but also, little things
too, like continuity.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.690
So I can copy some text
on my Mac or my iPhone

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.940
and then hit Paste and it
shows up in the Vision Pro.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.150
But there's two really
impressive ones to me

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.150
for very different specific reasons,

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.240
FaceTime and Mac Virtual Display.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:32.240
See, FaceTime is the most only
Apple could ship this thing

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.290
I've seen in a long time.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.080
From the personas scanned
in from the cameras

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.140
on the front of the headset
to the positional tracking

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.540
and responsiveness of the spatial audio,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.000
it's all so well thought
out that, you know,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.320
once everyone on the call

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.840
gets past the initial
like, "Ah, what is this?"

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.180
The shock, the moment they first see

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.680
the virtual version of you,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.050
once they first get past that,

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.660
then it actually kind
of slowly gets easier

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.870
and it feels way more
like a normal conversation

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.430
than a normal FaceTime.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.380
And it trades the
downside of not being able

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.770
to hold up objects to
your camera for a button

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.830
that can switch to a real
time first person view

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.380
where you can use both
hands instead of one.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.580
Does the audio from these speakers

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.020
still bleed out into the rest of the world

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.510
so anything over half
volume is incredibly audible

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.880
to everyone in the room around you?

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.630
Yeah, but does it also still
sound really, really impressive

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.780
for not actually being real headphones?

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.613
Yeah.

00:11:28.613 --> 00:11:31.530
But the other thing is
Mac Virtual Display.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.020
This is my number one favorite
feature of the Vision Pro,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.745
even over like watching movies and stuff.

00:11:35.745 --> 00:11:36.780
Now, first of all,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.420
yes, you can already do
remote desktop viewing

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.440
on something like a Quest 3,
it's great, I love that too.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.070
But this one is way more interesting.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.890
So this is connecting to your Mac

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.050
and then intaking and re-rendering

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.630
a new virtual display for your Mac,

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.510
not mirroring what's already
being shown by your computer.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.150
So you can use your Mac with
all of its existing controls

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.440
you're already using with it,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.520
but make your new monitor
literally as big as you want.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.060
And then, you can open up
simultaneous Vision Pro apps

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.100
all around that Mac display

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.320
and place them all around
the room wherever you want,

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.840
over the walls, floating in midair,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.360
pin them to other objects,
whatever, you can go nuts.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.530
Now, is this perfect?

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.570
No, there are definitely trade-offs.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.160
From even the little things,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.050
like not being able to see your keyboard

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.970
when you're in an immersive environment,

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.830
to only being able to have

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.650
a single virtual Mac monitor at a time,

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.650
to always having to look
where you're controlling,

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:35.850
I keep telling you guys,

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.580
there's definitely extra
brain cycles involved here.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.620
But I do still think
that, despite all that,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.250
this is my number one favorite
feature of this Vision Pro.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.230
The number one thing
that you can buy it for

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.190
and do that you couldn't do
with any other Apple product.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.023
I mean, it's the difference

00:12:51.023 --> 00:12:53.190
between looking like this in a coffee shop

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.090
or looking like this in a coffee shop.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.120
Pick your poison, I guess.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.740
I also had a moment where I was using

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.690
the Vision Pro for a
while and I had my Mac

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.040
and some other monitors around me,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.470
and then I took it off and
then I went and did something

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.830
and then I came back, and before
I put the headset back on,

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.150
I looked up at the wall

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.760
to where I thought a window was gonna be,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.300
but I hadn't, I hadn't...

00:13:15.246 --> 00:13:17.704
I don't know if that says
more about the headset

00:13:17.704 --> 00:13:18.990
or about me.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.320
(upbeat music)

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.320
But speaking of apps, we
gotta get into the weaknesses.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.610
And the app situation

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.920
on Vision Pro right now is one of them.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.960
So this is the home
screen of the Vision Pro,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.300
it has all of your apps,
you can't rearrange them,

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.470
it's always alphabetical.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.700
And this is a developing situation

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.590
that will record and improve over time,

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.160
but as of right now, as I
record this on launch day,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.393
there are literally 600 apps
made for the Vision Pro.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.030
And that sounds like a lot at first,

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.130
but then kind of not a lot.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.080
There are also the millions of other apps

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.000
that are made for the iPad

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.510
that are compatible with the
Vision Pro that will show up.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.020
But there's 600 apps made
specifically for the Vision Pro.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.230
The few apps that are showing
up here are pretty incredible,

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.710
and they all kind of find
unique and creative ways

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.230
to take advantage of the 3D space.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.960
And I fully believe the
rest of the developers

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.750
are also kind of still trying
to figure out what to do

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.120
with the 3D space in their own apps,

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.980
or even if it makes sense
to do anything at all

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.390
beyond the normal iPad app.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.120
But at this point right now today,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.870
I honestly believe that
there are way more cool ideas

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:32.400
about VR and AR experiences
than there are actual apps.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.900
Now, don't get me wrong,
there are some cool apps,

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.030
and like I said, I've shown
some in the past video,

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.350
there are some more in this video

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.210
and there will be more
of them pop up every day.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.880
But have you seen that video
of gamifying vacuum cleaning

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.410
so that you can actually

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.470
cover your entire floor space like a game?

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.320
It's not a real app, but if it was,

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.630
it would be pretty sick
and I would totally use it.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.860
Or maybe you've seen that other video

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.030
of watching an F1 race in
Vision Pro, it is so sick,

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.000
it's like there's a virtual
track overlaid into your space

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.670
so you can keep track of
everything happening at once,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.190
plus the times and, you
know, smaller video feeds

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.380
of the battles around
different points of the track.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.120
This looks genuinely better than

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.000
the actual TV broadcast experience,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.180
but it's also not a real app
yet, it's just a concept.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.530
And I've seen all kinds of other stuff

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.530
and I wanna watch an NBA game court side

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.520
in the Vision Pro too,

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.190
but that experience doesn't
seem to exist yet either.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.940
Whatever it is about like Apple
jumping into this new space

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.320
and all the implications of like,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.620
oh, okay, the tech is gonna
start to get better now,

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.710
this sort of unlocked
this new creative layer

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:39.210
for people to dream of
new AR and VR experiences,

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.650
and it'll be up to developers

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.250
to actually make that
stuff happen over time,

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.380
with the constraints
of today's technology.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.450
But as of right now, not a lot of apps,

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.630
also, no YouTube app, no Netflix app,

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.910
there's no Spotify app,
there's no TikTok app yet.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.740
I hope that Apple can sort
of patch up the relationship

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.140
with these developers
because getting those apps

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.570
will make this a better product.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:04.650
But as of right now,

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.603
that is definitely a weakness
of this first gen product.

00:16:07.603 --> 00:16:10.186
(upbeat music)

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.020
All right, I'm not the only
one who's been saying this,

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.516
but this is not the
most comfortable headset

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:16.920
and I figured out why.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.900
So first of all, everyone's
mentioned the weight,

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.230
and it's true, it does weigh like 25% more

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.670
than a lot of other headsets.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.350
Like, take the Quest 3, for example,

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.660
probably the most popular
one, familiar to most people,

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.560
that's mostly plastic
and it weighs 515 grams.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.180
So Vision Pro being made of
metal and having all this glass,

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.760
weighing in at nearly 650 grams,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.720
it kind of seems like Apple

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.370
just didn't care about the weight.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.320
But I don't think that's the case.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.180
Matter of fact, if you've
seen the tear downs

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.890
or if you've seen what's inside

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.870
this little computer here on your face,

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.180
this is built incredibly efficiently.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.760
There's carbon fiber in here, magnesium,

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.160
all sorts of other lightweight materials.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.130
Now there's still lots
of obvious heft on it,

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.160
but 25% more weight
shouldn't be the difference

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.570
between comfortable and, like,
I need to do neck exercises.

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:10.104
No, the problem is this strap,

00:17:10.104 --> 00:17:12.123
this is the Solo Knit strap,

00:17:12.123 --> 00:17:14.280
this is the strap that's
in all the commercials

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.113
that everybody sees.

00:17:15.113 --> 00:17:16.230
This is what's on Apple's website,

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.800
it's in all the Apple stores
because it looks so cool.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.560
And I think when Apple was
probably first deciding,

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.780
okay, we are gonna get into
this VR headset market,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.010
how do we differentiate ourselves?

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.350
We gotta reinvent a few things,

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.020
like the input method and all this stuff.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.867
I think they thought the
strap had to be one of them,

00:17:33.867 --> 00:17:35.610
and that's how we got this thing.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.940
And I think Dave2D was spot
on in his recent video,

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.270
VR headsets just kind of all look dumb,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:46.110
and the straps on them are all
so universally lame looking.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.330
And this strap is just so much cooler,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.120
you put it on, it's
the quickest to adjust,

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.280
it messes up your hair the least.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.410
It obviously has this
little adjustment thing

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.540
on the outside so you
can scroll this wheel

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.377
and satisfyingly like tighten
the cables inside like this.

00:18:00.377 --> 00:18:02.580
This must have taken a lot of R&amp;D

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.100
to get this thing to look iconic

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.110
and actually be functional, this is sick.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.300
But when you put it on,

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.940
you sort of tighten it up
against the front of your face

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.910
and it's squeezing it
up against your face,

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.010
all of the weight, up at the front

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.560
against basically these
two pressure points,

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.650
right above your eyes
and right on your cheeks.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.430
And the more you tighten
it to prevent light leak,

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.500
the more uncomfortable it gets.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.950
And it's just, it's so hard to wear this

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.010
for more than about 30, 45 minutes.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.770
After 45 minutes, I really
do need to take this off.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.180
So it's not your neck as much as

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.911
it's just all the pressure
on the front of your face.

00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:44.400
And Apple knows this,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.020
and that's why they've included
in the box this second band,

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.970
this is the dual loop band,

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.970
and it's super easy to pop this
one off and pop this one on.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.970
Now it's not as cool
looking as a Solo Knit Band,

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.590
and it's going to mess up your hair

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.270
more than a Solo Knit Band,

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.270
and it's not as easy to
adjust as a Solo Knit Band.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.950
You're literally like trying to find

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.040
and attach Velcro blindly
at the top of your head.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.960
Basically, it's almost as lame looking

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.105
as every other VR headset strap.

00:19:12.105 --> 00:19:15.660
But it turns out they all
look like this for a reason,

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.180
and oh my God, is it so much better

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.160
for wearing it for a long time.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.570
I just recently did the last episode

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.620
of the "Waveform Podcast",

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.030
you can go subscribe over there.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.430
I wore the headset for the entire thing,

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.050
a two hour recording,

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.990
and I could never have done
that with the Solo Knit Band,

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.880
and that's because it's
taking a ton of the pressure

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.400
off of the front of your
face and taking the weight

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.880
and using the top of your
head to support it instead.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.870
It's so much better.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.120
So if you're gonna just hand the headset

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.490
to someone to use it
for like five minutes,

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.780
the Solo Knit Band is great

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.580
'cause it's super quick,
doesn't mess up their hair,

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.500
easy to adjust, boom.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.940
But if you plan on using this thing

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.910
for an extensive period of time, yeah,

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.996
the dual loop band is 100% the way to go.

00:19:57.996 --> 00:20:01.320
(upbeat music)

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.110
So I don't know if the eyes
on the outside of this headset

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.000
are actually accomplishing

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.030
what Apple probably
wanted them to accomplish.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.060
I think this, again, comes down
to what we expect Vision Pro

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:17.060
to be in the future, see through
glasses, way down the line.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.680
But that's obviously not
possible with today's tech,

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.820
so the closest we can get
is a lenticular display

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.790
that shows your eyes to the outside world,

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.420
and so that you can see them
and they can kind of see you.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.640
I don't know, at this
point, I've tried my eyes,

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.380
but also everyone else here at the studio

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.050
has also scanned themselves
in and tried EyeSight,

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.360
and it's just not very visible.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.460
Like, the smooth glass of the headset

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.320
is so incredibly reflective

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.320
that there's almost always
some light bouncing off it

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.000
in a way that makes the eyes hard to see.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.890
And even if you can see it,

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.180
it's pretty low resolution,

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.590
thanks to the lenticular display,

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.660
and the bottom line is it doesn't

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.990
actually feel like eye
contact most of the time,

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.980
which is very different from

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.690
what you might have seen in the ads,

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.340
especially for darker skin tones.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.750
And I was actually
thinking about this like,

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.540
this is so far from
what I think I expected

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.380
that I was wondering,

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.590
does Apple in the next
generation Vision Pro

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.140
double down on EyeSight
or do they get rid of it?

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.030
And I think they have to keep it,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.550
like it's such an iconic
part of the headset

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.530
that everyone's expecting it to stay,

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.580
so it's gotta be there.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:25.580
But also, this is Vision
Pro and I think that implies

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.630
that we're gonna get Apple Vision

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:28.920
at some point down the road,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.860
which is like a less
expensive version of this.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.130
And with that, do you take out EyeSight

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.716
or does that still appear
in the lower end version?

00:21:38.716 --> 00:21:41.160
I don't know, only time will tell.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.827
(upbeat music)

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.160
So, all right, look,
at the end of the day,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.570
when I'm answering those texts

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:49.860
about what do people wanna know

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.630
what I really think about Vision Pro,

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.070
I think the Vision Pro

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:58.070
is a really expensive, really fun toy.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.710
Like, this is an incredibly
fun piece of tech to play with,

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.530
and I am loving watching
the pieces of media

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.780
built specifically for Vision Pro,

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.810
I am loving playing some
of the new early games

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:10.643
that are taking advantage

00:22:10.643 --> 00:22:13.410
of the 3D space and the hand controls,

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.930
I am loving the idea of getting on a plane

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.060
and editing videos on my Mac

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.280
or watching a movie on a gigantic screen

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.430
while the person next to me
can't see any of what I'm doing.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.320
That stuff is all so sick.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.640
And if you're actually
thinking about buying one,

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.930
I think you should be able to expect

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.300
to enjoy all of that same stuff too.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.140
But definitely still note
that all of the symptoms

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.000
of a first generation product

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.280
are definitely also still here.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.070
It's heavy, it's not a lot of apps,

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.730
the battery life is
meh and it's expensive.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.890
So here's the bigger question,

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:51.890
is the Vision Pro a guaranteed
success in the future?

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.320
Because the first generation iPhone

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.830
had all of the same
downfalls in its generation,

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.480
and look at where we are now.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.040
So, also, same with the
watch, same with the iPad.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.180
But here's the thing, you can't just say

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.760
the other stuff had problems
and it became successful,

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.710
therefore, this one having problems

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:11.880
also means it's successful.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.713
It doesn't work that way,

00:23:12.713 --> 00:23:15.750
there has to be something about this

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.280
that people actually like

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.530
that makes 'em willing to overlook

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.245
the first generation downfalls.

00:23:22.245 --> 00:23:26.007
And I think this has it, I think it has,

00:23:26.007 --> 00:23:29.430
I honestly, it's kind of
just the sci-fi, fun nature

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.380
of like controlling
things with your hands,

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.910
moving windows around the room,

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.040
the sci-fi movie energy, you've seen it,

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.900
you're probably already
thinking of a certain movie

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.870
that has that sort of
energy, this has that.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.790
And the fact that these ideas

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.410
of what people wanna do in VR

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:47.160
are so universally well liked and so cool,

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.050
that means that there's something here,

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.420
there's something that people want,

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.070
even in this first generation.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.390
Now, will all this new attention

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.850
on VR headsets in general
shine a lot of light

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.400
on all of the other
much cheaper competitors

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.080
that you should probably
buy instead of this one,

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.234
like the $500 Quest 3?

00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:04.680
Yeah.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.230
Now, will all this new developer attention

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.410
in this VR/AR space bring
a lot of way cooler,

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.970
way more awesome applications

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:14.460
that will rapidly improve
the value proposition

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.373
of this $3,500 first gen headset?

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.190
Yeah.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.890
Should you go out and buy one of these

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:24.210
if you've got the money

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.060
and you saw one or two
really cool looking apps

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.223
that you wanna try from the videos?

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.670
Sure, why not? It's your money.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:36.333
But I'm already very excited
for the next generation.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:38.410
Thanks for watching.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.153
Catch you guys in the next one, peace.

00:24:42.994 --> 00:24:45.577
