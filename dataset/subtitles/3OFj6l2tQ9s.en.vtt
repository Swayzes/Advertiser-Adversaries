00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:04.637
I built a giant death trap, which is
just one of many traps we built.

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:09.175
And for every trap this contestant
survives, he wins $100,000.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.678
But if he fails one,
he loses everything.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.179
The first trap is simple.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.781
He's got to break out of this cage

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.317
and climb up this roof
before the walls close in.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.452
- Mack, are you ready?
- I'm ready.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.254
- You sure?
- Do it.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.256
That was a little rude, but okay.

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.026
How am I supposed to get out of this.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.360
Mack, hey, you want a hit?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.827
What?

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.262
The roof

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:34.501
Hey Mack,
don't forget a $100,000 is on the line.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.201
Oh, my gosh.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.303
It's getting so close to the spikes.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.938
How does breaking the chair help?

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:40.940
Mack, come on.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.275
Iâ€™m trying, Jimmy, shut up.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.347
The wall is almost there. Mack, hurry.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.150
Mack, come on.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.684
Hurrry!

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.355
Come on, come on, come on.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.659
You just won a hundred grand!

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.227
Yeah!

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:02.829
- But...
- Yes!

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.632
But I have a second trap
set up for you right now.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.334
And if you risk this
hundred grand, you could win 200 grand.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:10.437
Think on it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.105
But I also don't have a video
if you don't say yes.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.039
I'm doing it.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.475
Let's go.
Mack may sound confident now,

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.844
but there are ten more traps
he has to get through

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:20.313
if he wants to walk out of this
with $1,000,000.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.982
But first, let's see if he can win
200 grand.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.351
Welcome to Trap number two.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.420
Close the door.

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.090
Glad we were not under that.
In these duffel bags.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.292
It's 200 grand in cash.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.893
All you have to do to win it,

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.429
is press that red button
and go back to this door.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.364
What happens when I press the button?

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:39.599
Just press it and find out.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.533
You wanna come with me?

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.135
Oh, no. I'm staying,
I'm staying over here.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.503
- Come with me.
- Go press the button.

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:45.905
In case you forgot

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.307
200 grand is on the line.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:50.443
I don't know what's going to happen
when I push the button.

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:51.678
Just press the button

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.748
The dramatic lights.

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.485
I think you can see what the trap is.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:01.454
If you touch a laser,
the door is going to slam closed.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:02.856
Is there a time limit?

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.459
There's a touch of the laser
limit and it's one.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.798
Bro, imagine if he just hit the first
laser.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.367
This is not made for short people dude.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:16.970
Oh my gosh.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.205
I had a feeling
he would crawl on the floor.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.340
That's why coming up,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.175
There's lasers
literally straight in front of him.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.710
I don't know how
I'm going to get past those.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.945
- I'm gonna be honest.
- Oh, this is crazy.

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.215
Oh my gosh.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.750
Oh, you're like,
surrounded by lasers.

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:31.818
Mack, I wouldn't move.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.522
Jimmy, if I touch the laser.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.657
How long do I have
before that door closes?

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.159
Less than a second.

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:40.727
Take a step to your left.

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:42.195
Take a step out of the way.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.263
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.966
Three, two, one.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.474
Oh my gosh.

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.608
That was so...

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:56.776
I'm speechless.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.145
Oh, yeah.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.182
- Let's go!
- Don't celebrate yet.

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:06.052
Do you want to walk away with 200
grand or risk it for 300 grand?

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.353
I think I want to
do the next one.

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:08.221
Let's do it.

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:11.291
Unfortunately for Mack,
all of these traps get progressively

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:14.527
harder and harder to pass,
especially this next one.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.495
Mack, come on in.

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.798
You're now in trap number three.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.333
Bro, look how cool this is.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:23.102
We literally spent the last 60 days
designing this set.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:25.939
This is the $200,000
you've already won.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.340
All you have to do here is grab

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.776
the next hundred thousand dollars,
and then all you got to do

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.545
is walk down this path and walk
right through this door.

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:33.980
What's going to happen
when I grab the money?

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:35.715
- Look around.
- It's over your head on this one.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.318
Okay.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.586
Starting to click for me
a little bit.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:40.987
That was a little too obvious.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.488
I'd say as soon as I picked up money

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:43.590
that boulder's coming straight for me.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:47.227
And if you get ran over by the
boulder, I take my 300 grand back.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.328
Oh, dude

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.130
I'm going to go over here so I don't get
squished by a boulder.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:53.199
I want you to count me down
for three.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.768
Three, two, one.

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:58.338
Go!

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.610
Oh, my God.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:04.644
Go, go, go

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:05.345
You got to go.

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:06.179
Go, go, go.

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:07.247
Back off!

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.317
Not going to lie

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.486
You are much faster than I thought.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.256
Oh, my gosh.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.890
That boulder was right behind him.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.158
Are you going to go for a fourth?

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:20.126
I don't know, Jim.

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.027
You're actually getting better.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.862
If that thing hit me,
what would happen? Would I die?

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.897
Well, here's what happened to Nolan
when he got hit.

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:28.835
It hurts.

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:30.603
- I'm sorry, I just got to...
- Yeah, of course.

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:32.705
No, this is a big decision.
You should really think it through.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:34.707
Okay, so what do you do?

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.776
- Okay, I'll do one more.
- One more?

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:37.710
- One more, yeah.
- All right.

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.746
Let's go see if
he loses 300 grand...

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:40.980
 or makes more money.

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.448
Don't phrase it like that, Jimmy.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.185
Mack is now in a ball.

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.986
How's it feel?

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.622
I'm realizing
how bad I smell in this ball.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:50.890
You chose this.

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.292
Open the door.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.994
Welcome to trap number four.

00:04:56.496 --> 00:05:00.366
For this trap, I made a life sized
video game that he has to complete.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:02.602
Oh my gosh, dude.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.073
To win 400 grand, all Mack needs to do
is complete this course.

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:08.007
In case it's not clear

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:11.044
If you fall down there in the foam,
you lose.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.345
I see that.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:14.614
Oh, yeah. One more thing.

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:17.016
You only have 5 minutes
to complete the course.

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:19.786
Okay.

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:21.654
First things first.

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:22.822
We have these little platforms.

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:23.890
Not too crazy.

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.126
This is so much harder in a ball.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.595
Bro, if he's unironically
struggling with this,

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.165
Wait until he gets to all the moving
platforms of death.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:33.733
This is not going to be easy,

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.570
Oh my gosh, dude.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:38.871
Jump!

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:40.406
Jump?

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.542
Mack, be careful.

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:46.179
400 grand on the line.

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:47.513
Here, can I join you?

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:49.615
- Why? why?
- I don't know.

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:50.550
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.851
Because I want to be in the video.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:52.919
It's my video.

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:56.789
This is terrifying

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.260
Up to this point, it's been pretty easy.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:03.229
This is where it starts to get difficult.

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.630
This is where it's difficult?

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.065
It has not been easy.

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:09.569
Oh, this is crazy, dude.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:11.971
Unlike the other challenges.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.339
He's actually going pretty quick.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.975
Balancing inside of this
ball is harder than it looks.

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:20.146
It multiplies all of your movements,
meaning you can fall at any time.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:24.517
This ball is so hard to balance in.

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:25.752
Bro, it's 400 grand.

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:26.986
It's not supposed to be easy.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:31.090
The obstacle so far in this trap are
nothing compared to the final stage.

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:33.192
This is where it gets really hard.

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:36.095
I couldn't have been more wrong.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.064
Mack literally obliterated

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:40.867
the last stage of this course
in 10 seconds.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.268
Oh my God!

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:46.372
That is what I'm talking about!

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.274
bro, whenever he wins,
I get afraid to be around him.

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:50.877
I don't know what to say when
I sketch this on a piece of paper.

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:52.044
It seemed a lot harder.

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:55.615
However, the traps that follow this one
are harder than anything

00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:56.549
we've seen so far.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:57.750
Answer the riddle.

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:59.485
What is better than 400 grand?

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.054
500 grand?

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:06.392
Are you going to be a wuss or
do you want a chance to win $500,000?

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.895
If the next one is going to be
as easy as this, let's run it back.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.230
I didn't say it would,
but I'm going to take that as a yes.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.798
Next trap.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:14.634
Which Mack is going to need
a bathing suit for because...

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.436
It might involve some swimming.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.004
Jimmy, what is this?

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.906
Mack, hop in this water real quick.

00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:22.642
Mack, do you have
any idea what you're doing?

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:23.309
Not really.

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.912
Okay. This trap is hard, but simple.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:30.082
When I say go, your money will be
pulled towards that massive bonfire.

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:32.318
 To stop it
You need to pull that lever.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:35.455
And to get there, you'll have to swim
through this underwater chamber

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:38.357
and pick the locks of all four doors
in your path.

00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:39.892
Got it.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.994
You're probably wondering,
why am I holding a clothes hanger?

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:43.629
Because that's
how you pick the locks.

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:46.399
- Mack, are you ready?
- I'm ready!

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:47.533
Three, two.

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:50.269
Oh, wait, Mack,
could you fix that thing behind you?

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:54.273
All right, the timer has started.

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:04.450
This money in exactly 3 minutes,
it's going to be in that fire pit.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.620
Unless Mack comes out the other end,
and flips that lever.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:10.923
He's struggling right now.

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:19.765
How is he holding his
breath this long?

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:27.073
So Mack just unlocked the first lock.

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:32.011
You got this, Mack.

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.814
And while he's competing
for half a million dollars,

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:36.749
I want to tell you about
Stumble Guys.

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:39.218
A free to play multiplayer game
where you basically compete

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:40.953
against random people
in knockout games

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.955
and whoever comes out on top wins
the crown.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.125
Every time Mack unlocks the lock,
he goes deeper

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.460
and deeper into the water,

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:48.961
which means he has less and less time

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:52.231
to pick his locks as he has to
come back up to the surface for air.

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:53.933
That is so hard to see.

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:03.376
Bro, this is crazy.

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:07.046
 Stumble Guys even took
some of our biggest videos

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:09.348
and turned them into levels
in the actual game.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.885
And on top of that, Stumble Guys
now has MrBeast skins, emotes

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.788
and even victory animations
available inside their item shop.

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:18.324
He got the third door open.

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:21.761
There's also a special MrBeast-themed event
coming soon on Stumble Guys,

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:24.730
so make sure you download an iOS,
Android or Steam

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:26.265
for free right now.

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:30.036
All right, Mack. One more door.

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:33.472
Bye bye.

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:45.151
Look how close the money is
to the fire.

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.967
He is almost done,
I think he just opened the fourth gate.

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:04.437
Pull the lever.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.105
You got to pull the lever!

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.979
You just stopped the money!

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.482
Oh, my gosh.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:18.884
I hate you.

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:20.953
You might be a little lightheaded from
the lack of oxygen.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.254
I could barely see.

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:24.690
I know, see that 500 grand
floating right there?

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:27.059
Do you want to risk it for 600 grand?

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:29.695
Full transparency.

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:30.596
The next trap.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.431
It's probably the easiest trap
of all.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:34.066
I'm serious.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.135
If you were to ever stop,
I don't think now is

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:37.136
when you would want to stop.

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:38.571
- All right, let's do it. I'm in.
- Yeah?

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:40.506
- Yeah yeah, let's go.
- That could have been a lie.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.707
What?

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:43.242
I was, in fact, not lying.

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:45.645
Anyone with a developed prefrontal cortex

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:47.313
should be able to pass this next one.

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:48.948
Welcome to the next trap.

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:52.351
This, in theory, should be the
easiest 100 grand of your life.

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:56.389
Okay, I need you to pick either
a Feastables Bar or a Hershey's bar

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.059
One needs to go in the trash

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.933
- There we go!
- Yeah!

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:10.770
I will never eat that.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.570
- Disgusting!
- Well of course...

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:12.938
Cause you just won
a hundred grand.

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:13.806
That's right.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:17.209
Now you have $600,000 in cash.

00:11:17.743 --> 00:11:20.112
- Jimmy that's six lamborghinis
- And a Feastable bar.

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:21.180
I'll throw that in.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.014
Thanks.

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:25.151
Do you want to risk this $600,000

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:27.086
Mini ocean of money

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:29.488
For the chance to win $700,000?

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:31.991
You're crazy.

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:33.059
I can tell he's about to say yes.

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:34.326
I donâ€™t knowâ€¦

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.829
Dude, my mom is gonna be so mad
at me if I lose this right now.

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:37.630
Yes or no?

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:39.265
Just one more. What's one more?

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:41.634
- All right, let's do it. Yes.
- All right.

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:42.268
One more.

00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:43.536
I actually though.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.438
Please do not let me do
one after that.

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:46.405
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:48.140
Well, where we're going on this next trap,

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.775
Mack is going to need a blindfold.

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:51.110
All right, can you see?

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:52.945
I cannot see.

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:54.980
That was a lie.

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:57.450
All right,
maybe actually two blindfolds.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.884
I hope he's not scared of heights.

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.989
And if you're wondering
why I said up heights earlier...

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:04.924
Well...

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:06.258
Send us up!

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:07.393
Oh, we're going up.

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:08.494
No, no, no, no, no.

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:11.063
Mack may know that we're going up,
but not how far

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:11.997
Oh my God, dude.

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:14.567
We're going 200
feet in the air,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.403
where he's going to have
to face his biggest fear

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:20.306
If he wants to walk away with 700
grand

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:21.273
Mack...

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:23.142
let's take off the trash can.

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:25.544
Heads up!

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:29.815
Mack...

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:31.884
Welcome to the next trap.

00:12:33.986 --> 00:12:35.154
I hope you're not afraid of heights.

00:12:35.187 --> 00:12:36.355
I'm scared, bro.

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:38.090
Dude, that looks terrifying.

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:39.759
The next trap is simple.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.761
All you have to do is walk
to the other side

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:44.029
on this absurdly thin balance beam.

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.801
Okay, this is insane.
Oh, my gosh.

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.870
I just don't know how
he's going to do this.

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:52.338
I'm so scared right now.

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:53.739
 I'm so scared.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.074
Bro, this is terrifying.

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:57.176
- I don't... Would you do this?
- Oh, heck no.

00:12:57.176 --> 00:12:58.344
I would never do this.

00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:00.346
700 grand down the line.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.814
His worst fear.

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:02.982
Let's see what happens.

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:04.750
Okay. I can't think about anymore.

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:06.852
It is what it is.

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:14.693
There. Oh, he's definitely
at the point of no return.

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:16.195
Karl, don't move...

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:20.466
Oh my gosh.

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:23.235
Holy crap. Heâ€™s making itâ€¦ Oh!

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:26.739
No way.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.711
Yeah!

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:34.380
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.182
- Yes!
- Oh my God!

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:37.917
That's what I'm talking about.

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.953
That's what I'm talking about, baby.

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:42.922
Oh my God, dude.

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:46.659
Based on the first couple of steps,
I did not think he was going to make it

00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:47.860
As requested,

00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:49.562
I will not try to influence you.

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:51.897
Do you want to walk away
with your 700 grand

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:55.334
or risk it and keep going for
the million dollars your decision?

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:59.972
I have the opportunity right now to
leave with just an insane amount of money.

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:01.707
But...

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:02.875
I'm just...

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:04.143
I'm just so close.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.477
I just feel like everyone at home
wants

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.679
to see the next three challenges,
right?

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:07.613
I do.

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:09.281
Final answer.

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:10.950
I'm going to the next one.

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:11.984
Yeah!

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:13.319
If he fails the next trap,

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:14.353
I'm going to feel terrible.

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:16.088
Mack now only has three traps

00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:19.525
remaining to win $1,000,000,
but it only gets harder from here.

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:21.327
You decide to risk the money.

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:23.062
- Let's do this.
- I'm so scared.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:24.463
Lights on!

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:27.233
This next
trap may look a little familiar

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:28.834
Our most viewed video is Squid Game

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.804
So I thought it would be fun
if we combined the glass bridge game

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:35.908
with the cookie cutting game
all into one trap.

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:39.445
Just like in Squid Game,
you have a honeycomb here.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:42.648
You have to cut out the shape
that's there and put that exact

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:43.949
shape on the scanner.

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:45.251
If you break the cookie,

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:47.620
it won't fit in the circle
and the bridge will drop you.

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:48.854
And I lose everything.

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:51.257
But if it's the exact same size,
the door will open

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.892
and you have to do it three more times

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:53.893
How much time to have?

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:55.094
There is no time limit.

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:56.128
- Thank God.
- No, but you've been...

00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:56.896
- Thank God!

00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:58.864
Some of these challenges, he takes an hour.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.099
so I might give you one.

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:02.768
- No, don't give me a time limit.
- Okay, well, can you just at least start?

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:06.038
Okay. A strategy. Jimmy,
is I lick this boy.

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:07.406
And that's going to melt the sugar.

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:09.742
And then ideally, I can poke this
needle through this cookie.

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:11.410
So your strategy is Squid Games.

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:13.913
That's the way to put it.
Yeah.

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:19.351
- Mack.
- Get away from me.

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:21.520
- I didn't touch you.
- You need to stay over there.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.755
What about my croc?

00:15:23.188 --> 00:15:25.424
No. Well, now I don't have a shoe.

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:26.425
It's the only way to teach you, man.

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:27.259
All right, here we go.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:32.364
It's taking forever.

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:35.401
I understand that this money
is essentially meaningless to you.

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:37.002
Me? This will change my life.

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:39.939
So I'm going to take my sweet time
cutting the circle out.

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:41.473
You can take your sweet time.
Take your sweet time

00:15:41.573 --> 00:15:42.341
Just the next one.

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:43.876
I'm probably going put a time limit.

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:44.677
No!

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:46.378
Halfway done.

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:49.915
That's it, right?

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.050
Okay, put it there.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.088
You're good.

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:57.723
Light's on.

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.427
He's going to solve the triangle
pretty easily.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.898
But after the triangle is a star
and an umbrella which are way harder.

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:09.568
Okay.

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:10.502
 Cookie.

00:16:11.904 --> 00:16:12.571
Also, wait, wait.

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:13.205
Before you open it.

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:14.106
One second.

00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:17.876
Oh, no,

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:21.280
I'll replace that because the money
was so far away I moved it over here.

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:23.015
In case you forgot what you're
competing for.

00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:25.150
- Part of it's really far away.
- I will replace it.

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:25.718
Okay.

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:26.752
You can proceed.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:28.821
For the record,
I regret saying yes to this.

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:30.189
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:32.691
At this point see how sad you are
at the thought of losing?

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:36.095
I would actually highly recommend
if you win to walk away after this.

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.263
That's what I thought after
I finished the high ropes course.

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:39.999
That's what you thought after every trap,

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.133
But yet, we're here.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.135
Wow, that's just sliding off.

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:44.403
Last piece.

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:49.708
Oh my gosh.

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:51.210
I think he did it.

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:54.813
Okay.

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:56.648
Walk on in here.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:57.649
Cookie us.

00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:01.387
Now comes the real challenge.
Umbrella.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.355
The hardest shape.

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:05.524
If I win this, I don't think
I should risk it again, dude.

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.059
All right, how about this?

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:11.196
Cut this stupid umbrella out and then
just take the money for my sanity.

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:12.398
For my sanity, dude.

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:13.198
Okay.

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:15.834
Oh, and by the way,
this one has a ten minute timer.

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:18.003
- Okay, it's ticking right now?
- Yeah.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.873
9 minutes and 50 seconds
remain.

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:23.242
I love you.

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:24.643
I will not be speaking to you
while I'm doing this.

00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:26.011
I completely understand

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.981
$800,000 is on the line.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.682
Give me a dollarbill, like a stack money.
Give it to me.

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:31.483
Stack, okay.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.053
He's using the money as a hammer.

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:36.055
They didn't do that in Squid Game.

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:38.791
I've never felt more intensity
in my life.

00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:41.493
This is very, very difficult.

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:43.128
I don't know what I'm going to do
with myself if I lose this.

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:47.399
5 minutes remain.

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.101
Honestly, I think you can do this.

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:51.236
I feel like
I'm going to break it, dude.

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:54.506
Shoe hammer

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:57.943
Dude, I'm just making no progress.

00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:03.382
2 minutes.

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:10.355
He's starting to break it off.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.129
He's starting to pull pieces of.

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:21.700
Just so you know,
there's 60 seconds left Mack.

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:38.484
Wait, what just happened?

00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:40.552
Oh, no.

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:52.865
I actually don't know what to say.

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:57.703
I'm such an idiot, dude.

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:00.072
And I had it all.

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:02.441
It's $700,000.

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.443
I don't know why I did
this.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:08.080
Would it have hurt less
if you just lost the first challenge?

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:10.349
So much less.

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:11.917
Well, here, come on buddy.

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:15.020
Come on. Let's stand up.

00:19:17.122 --> 00:19:18.490
Let it be known.

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.259
If you're in a MrBeast video...

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.427
quit while you're ahead.

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:29.635
I'll be honest, guys.

00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:31.637
This was pretty sad.

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:35.073
So I decided to give Mack an extra 100
grand for his troubles.

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:37.976
Let me know if you want to see
more videos like this one.

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:40.879
Hopefully
the next one has a happier ending.

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.248
See you later.
