00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.970
- So if I build a new lens

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.670
and my lens only works with my camera,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.430
then that's vertical integration.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.100
Or if I build new headphones

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.583
and my headphones only work with my cable,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.190
that's vertical integration.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.242
Now, if I build a new smartwatch

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:23.490
and my smartwatch only
works with my smartphone,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.260
be careful that might be illegal.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.610
That's a bit of an oversimplification,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.487
but let's talk about it.

00:00:31.487 --> 00:00:34.080
(upbeat music)

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.430
So this is a developing story

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.140
and will continue to develop for years,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.480
but I feel like it all
comes down to something

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.820
that I've at least noticed in talking

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.270
to all these big companies,
all these very public,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.630
multi-billion dollar companies,
they always have two reasons

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.500
for any public-facing
statement that they make.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.243
There's the reason for the public,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.670
and then there's the real reason.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.020
So there's just some news this past week

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.870
of the US Department of
Justice suing Apple saying

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.840
that they are an illegal
monopoly in the United States,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.160
the iPhone specifically.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.480
Now, whenever there's legal proceedings,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.610
obviously things get very complicated,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.260
and I won't even pretend

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.630
to be diving into this
at a super deep level.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.710
But this is also interesting to me

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.200
because of all the stuff with the things

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.160
that we talk about every day

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.510
which is just smartphones and gadgets.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.750
And of course this is a
pretty US specific thing,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.270
like obviously they're
being sued by the US,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.440
but also their dominance,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.700
Apple, the iPhone is the
most popular in the US.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.430
So I think these are some
numbers we should keep in mind.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.210
In the US the iPhone is
at like 60% market share,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.590
and it's even way higher up
near 90% with young people,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.480
like it is ridiculously dominant.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.890
But worldwide, the iPhone is
at about a 25% market share.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.370
So the iPhone is specifically
trending towards a monopoly

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.734
in the United States.

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:54.401
(upbeat music)

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.520
So here's where it gets
really interesting.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.030
I would like to live in
this analogy for this video,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.070
which is, you've heard
about people describing

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.550
Apple's ecosystem as a
walled garden before,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.350
this could not be more true, right?

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.800
There's this really, really
nice, beautiful luscious garden

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.830
and in the middle of
that garden is the iPhone

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.660
and it has these really tall,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.310
thick walls all the way around it.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.680
So in an ideal world,
right, you are just picking

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.970
between different options

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.790
for a product based on its
merits, based on its features.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.070
So you just look at the
whole lineup and you go,

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.990
yeah, I like this one the best.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.730
And that's how you make
your choice, right?

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.720
Sick.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.690
But with this one, the claim is

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.900
Apple is making it
really, really difficult,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.700
once you've chosen theirs

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.200
to ever switch to anything else.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.050
So with this analogy,
again, it's really the walls

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.380
of the garden that we have the issue with.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.120
So I'll give you, I'll do two examples.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.860
So take the Apple Watch, right?

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.910
This is one of the examples

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.690
in the Department of Justice's 88 page PDF

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.761
that they've submitted.

00:02:55.761 --> 00:03:00.720
The iPhone and the Apple Watch
work perfectly well together

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.160
and only together.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.560
It's a feature, it's by design.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.520
That's how they are.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.470
So two parts of that are sketchy.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.820
One is the Apple Watch works
really well with the iPhone

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.480
in a way that no other smartwatch can.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.200
And two, the Apple Watch does not work

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.880
with any other smartphone.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.500
So look, I don't think it's a surprise

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.900
that when Apple built a
watch, they gave it all kinds

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.370
of integrations with the iPhone.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.650
So you can see them
working perfectly together.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.290
You can see and dismiss
your notifications,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.110
you can reply to messages,
track your fitness.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.480
You can even use it as a shutter
for your iPhone's camera.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.950
All these features that they just plug

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.690
right into the iPhone, they work great.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.880
And I think that's even what
Apple would tell people.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.190
They would agree like,
this is how we made it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.230
so that they work amazingly well together.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.970
This is vertical integration.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.170
It's awesome.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.650
But there's also the real reason.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.780
Because the truth is now if you try

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.900
to use any other
smartwatch with the iPhone,

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.620
you just don't get nearly as
many of those useful features

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.330
from being super well integrated.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.580
If you try to use like a
Garmin smartwatch for example,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.950
you don't get the
viewfinder for the camera,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.310
you don't get the fitness
tracking through Apple Fitness,

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.570
you don't get quick replies,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.690
you don't get even image
previews for your text messages.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.860
You don't even get to choose

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.660
which apps show you notifications.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.920
It's just all or nothing.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.500
So if you choose an iPhone,
then next, when you're looking

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.720
for a smartwatch to buy, there's kind

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.900
of only really one good
full fledged option,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.460
which is the Apple Watch.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.830
This is also true, by the
way, to various degrees

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.490
with AirPods and AirTags

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.980
and various other things
in Apple's ecosystem

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.230
because they all are great
when you have an iPhone

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.110
and work super well with
it, but work horribly

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.460
or not at all when you don't.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.740
So that is part of the,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.470
that's the walls around the ecosystem

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.240
that make it really hard to leave.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.720
Because if you now wanna
switch from the iPhone

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.660
to the Android phone, you're
not just switching phones,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.770
You have to now get a
new phone and a new watch

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.910
and new headphones and a new
tracker and all this stuff

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.640
because they all worked
so well with the iPhone

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.380
and so horribly with anything else.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.530
So that is a real barrier

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.620
to people leaving this
ecosystem once they get into it.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.550
So another example is
the whole blue bubbles

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.070
and green bubbles thing that they do.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.110
I've already made an entire
video about this dynamic.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.070
If you haven't already seen it,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.240
I'll leave a link with a like button below

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.200
if you wanna watch it.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.200
But basically today, when
iPhones message other iPhones,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.600
they have tons of features
and typing indicators

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.910
and high res media, and
those are blue bubbles.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.760
And when they message Android
phones, it falls back to SMS,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.570
which is slow, low res, unencrypted trash

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.860
that is green bubbles.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.220
And Apple just refuses to
make iMessage work on Android.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.590
The Department of Justice
actually literally references

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.050
a video of Tim Cook on
stage at a conference

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.970
where he says this.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.550
- it's tough not to make it personal,

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.440
but I can't send my mom certain videos

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.820
or she can't send me certain videos.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.653
And so we leave-

00:06:00.653 --> 00:06:02.650
- Buy your mom an iPhone.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.345
(everyone laughing)

00:06:04.345 --> 00:06:05.490
- All right.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.160
- And this is so poetic
just because, you know,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.930
obviously he's got this smile of like,

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.520
you guys all know it's true,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.160
but also it goes back to
what I said at the beginning,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.830
which is with any of these
public-facing decisions,

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.593
there's the answer that
they give the public.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.780
And then there's the real reason.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.870
You know, originally iMessage
was built back in the days

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.660
where text messages were
basically paid per text.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.020
Like every SMS cost
money, hence the green.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.410
So iMessage would work over
the internet and be unlimited

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.760
and it would offer way more features

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.560
and they'd build onto it over time.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.480
Adding encryption and reactions

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.430
and typing indicators, all this stuff.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.260
And Apple people and Apple themselves

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.240
would probably all agree like this is,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.560
it's just a thing that Apple built

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.910
that's way better than SMS.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.670
Like it's not their fault, SMS sucks,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.280
they just made a better thing.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.300
So yeah, of course, yeah,

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.190
they're gonna build their
own version of a thing

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.640
and it's not illegal to not
also develop it for Android.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.883
They just made their own
thing for the iPhone.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.077
But also Tim Cook's quote,

00:07:05.077 --> 00:07:07.410
"just buy your mom an iPhone"

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.840
is the other equally valid point.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.160
It's the real reason.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.140
There are plenty of internal emails

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.310
that have surfaced over time

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.500
with Apple executives openly talking about

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.380
how giving iMessage to
Android would make it easier

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.020
for people to switch to
Android from the iPhone.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.540
iMessage is clearly one of
the walls of the ecosystem

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.540
and it's probably one of
the biggest thickest walls.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.960
Like ask any young person in the US today

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.760
why they use an iPhone.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.650
And I think a lot of them
would probably tell you

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.060
something to do with iMessage.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.320
So is this stuff that
they're doing illegal,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.030
I guess is the question,

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.710
or maybe even another way to phrase it is,

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.920
is Apple making other products worse

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.070
or are they making their
own products really good

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.960
and then not letting other things

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.023
outside the ecosystem have
access to those things?

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.630
It's kind of both, honestly.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.010
But the thing is,

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.800
they're not the only ones
doing a lot of this stuff.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.690
They are just the ones that happen to be

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.510
in this pseudo-monopoly
position right now.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.250
Like the Pixel Watch for example

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.650
does not work at all with the iPhone.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.480
It just works perfectly
with Android phones.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.540
But is anybody that mad about that?

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.460
You know, RCS is announced to be coming

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.680
to the iPhone at some point in 2024,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.880
but I can almost guarantee

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.130
it'll probably still be green bubbles.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.100
It will probably be the
absolute bare minimum

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.870
of supporting RCS

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.570
and they will probably still
be delineating very clearly

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.360
between iPhone to iPhone, iMessage

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.820
and iPhone to Android something else.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.470
And there's even more to this lawsuit,

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.940
like Apple Pay is another one.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.753
How no other services can use
the NFC chip on the iPhone.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.820
Super apps is another one.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.080
Like if you wanna look at all this stuff,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.690
I will link the best stuff
I can find down below.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.220
So my take is Apple is
technically yet guilty

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.300
of all these things.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.890
They're doing all stuff,

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.680
but in the walled garden analogy,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.490
it's like they have built up
a really, really nice garden.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.860
And Apple would say like,
look, our garden, it's so green

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.510
and luscious and beautiful.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.730
They've built the most beautiful garden

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.113
with the most people in it,

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.350
but they've also built
up the biggest walls

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.430
around that garden.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.810
And so Apple would love to say, look,

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.190
everyone's chosen our garden

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.600
and they're all staying in our garden.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.860
That's how great it is.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.375
But even if you saw another greener,

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:26.160
softer, better garden somewhere
else, the walls to escaping

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
to getting to that are just way too high.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.760
So it's less that each individual
thing that they're doing

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.610
with the products working
well together is illegal.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.450
And it's more that they feel
like they have to do something

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:44.160
about this one company having
so much power and control

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.960
in smartphones, which is here,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.760
it's essentially a commodity.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.800
It's just like a thing that everybody has.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.510
So I wanna leave you with this.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.710
You remember at the beginning

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.710
when I talked about how
Apple's ridiculously dominant

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.800
in the US and these crazy
numbers, like 90% of young people.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.710
The crazy thing is they're
super, super popular here,

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.970
but as I mentioned, they are
not a monopoly anywhere else.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.830
And why?

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.760
Why is that true?

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.230
How are they so popular here

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.210
and they're doing all the
same stuff in other places,

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.160
but they're not a
monopoly in other places?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.630
And so I think of China for example.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.090
China is another huge smartphone market

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.950
where WeChat is kind
of like this super app.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.820
It's a huge thing.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.310
Like it's messaging, it's payments,

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.580
it's also calling a taxi
and also paying your bills

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.810
and ordering food, groceries,
like WeChat is everything.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.150
So just as long as your phone has WeChat,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.790
then the rest is kind of
doesn't really matter,

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.623
it's up to you.

00:10:39.623 --> 00:10:42.600
And so in China there's
this incredibly vibrant,

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.360
innovative landscape of all
these smartphone manufacturers

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.260
competing like crazy,
like Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.490
and iPhone is in there too.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.040
But they're all just competing ruthlessly

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.270
with hardware features

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.460
and with other stuff to
try to get your attention

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.320
to maybe pick their phone

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.850
'cause it's just what you're into.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.020
They all have WeChat.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.340
So in a market like that,

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.920
people will buy your phone based on

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.460
if it's actually better or not.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.260
Meaning there's lots of gardens

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.830
and very few walls around those gardens.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.530
That's what a good competitive
landscape looks like.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.150
Now, what would be maybe illegal

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.170
or a wrong thing to do is if
WeChat or the makers of WeChat,

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.880
if Tencent made a phone

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.220
and then they gave their
phone special access

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.660
to certain parts of WeChat

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.740
that suddenly no other phone
could get, then monopoly.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.292
So this lawsuit and all this
legal versus illegal stuff,

00:11:34.292 --> 00:11:38.010
it's mainly just a way
to try to poke some holes

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.300
and get closer to that
level of lower walls

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.820
and more competition that
makes everybody better.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.400
Then we're actually competing
on innovation again.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.020
But it's something that will be evolving

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.370
for a long time over time.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.530
So it'll be interesting to keep an eye on.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.380
And speaking of things
that might be illegal,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.690
shout out to Dbrand for
sponsoring this video.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.460
So you might have heard about,

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.660
unless you've been living under a rock,

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.070
you've heard about their grip case by now.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.680
So I've got their latest
Hydrodip cases here

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.070
and I gotta say the name
matches it perfectly.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.300
You know, these days a lot of phone cases

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.920
are just kind of boring plastic shells,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.140
but with Dbrand they're kind
of playing with some stuff

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.000
and these are some crazy colorways

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.700
and these trippy hydrodipped patterns.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.900
Plus with the Gold Rush one,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.250
if you catch it under the right light,

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.580
you'll notice a little
low key metallic effect

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.440
under this matte finish, which is sick.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.000
Now in addition to the impact protection

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.050
that you expect from
premium case, perfect.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.370
Grip cases also have

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.590
what I would consider attention to detail.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:35.700
So that's two things.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.470
First of all, these buttons,
they're just really cliquey,

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.790
they're nice, they're probably better

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.590
than the actual phones buttons.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.850
But also, in general,

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.880
like we've all eventually dropped a phone,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.710
whether it's like out of a car

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.800
or on your face while
watching a YouTube video.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.700
It happens.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.730
Ideally, this case prevents it

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.920
'cause it's in the name,
it's the Grip Case.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.260
This texture is pretty nice at that.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.650
So it's hopefully gonna prevent
that sort of drop stuff.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:09.090
But in the case you do drop
it then, yeah, should be fine.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:09.923
It's good.

00:13:09.923 --> 00:13:11.400
So yeah, if you wanna,

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.480
if you're a case person,

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.820
I would say at least get
yourself a nice Grip Case.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.320
I'll leave a link below.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.153
But that's it.

00:13:17.153 --> 00:13:18.390
Thanks for watching this video

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.760
and lemme know what you
think about these features

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.620
and the iPhone and
everything going on with it.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.602
And I'll catch you guys in the next video.

00:13:25.602 --> 00:13:26.540
Peace.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.123
(upbeat music)
