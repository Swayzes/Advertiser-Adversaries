00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:04.637
These tanks are literally about
to rain missiles on this $500,000.

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:07.507
And any money that doesn't
get destroyed, I'm giving to Blake.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.176
But lucky for you, I'm
going to give you my credit card.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.711
And you can spend as much money

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:12.245
as you want

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:14.547
trying to protect this money
from all of the missiles

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:15.915
we're going
to be firing at your money.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.218
- So I just build whatever I want?
- Whatever you want.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.354
But you only have 24 hours
before we fire the tanks.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.856
I need metal! Let’s go!

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.457
Alright, let’s go boys!
He’s running!

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.026
We're kicking this off
with a sprint.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.660
All right, Blake,
where are we heading to first?

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.896
- I’m thinking the Junkyard.
- Blake's first 3 hours

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:33.199
consisted of sourcing any metal
he could find to protect his money.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:37.837
I mean, this looks like they have metal,
even if that meant spending $30,000.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.873
Definitely want that. Want that
All the trucks.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.808
- Basically, you just want every car here.
- Yeah.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.576
Can you give me any of your shipping
containers?

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.177
Let’s go out back!

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:45.612
Yeah. This is good.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:47.847
Those would work well
if I put them on top of the money.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.550
And is if buying out
the entire store wasn't enough.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.887
Blake did the same thing
at two other industrial stores.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.422
Well, everything I get from you today

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.590
I would need within
the next 12 hours.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:58.558
12 hours?

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.361
- I’m willing to pay double.
- Ok, we’ll get it.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.530
It is very quick
to throw my money around.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.831
$15,000

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:07.233
And while we waited,
for the materials to be delivered.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.537
We headed back to the money, and
Blake laid out his official plan.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.872
You just spent the last hour
strategizing.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.641
What did you come up with
to stop the tanks

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:15.809
from destroying your money?

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.945
Step one I want to put a shipping
container over the money.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.346
That is actually genius.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.315
Step two, giant water tanks.

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:23.383
Do you think that's your best
defense?

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.851
I think it's good,
but it's not the best.

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:27.387
Step three these containers
filled with bricks.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.488
hay and wood.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.657
Step four is my best defense.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.427
A fortress of strategically angled
cars from the last video that I saw.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:37.397
Those bullets are going to hit
those cars and ricochet elsewhere.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.632
If he actually builts
everything you see here,

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:41.201
I will be flabbergasted.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.268
- Let's get to work.
- Good luck.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:43.603
Unfortunately for Blake,

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.773
it wouldn't be for another 4 hours
until his materials were delivered.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:49.742
So he hired some construction
workers to help get the job done.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.744
I'm building a complete fortress.

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.246
If we dropped the atomic bomb
on this thing,

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:54.314
the money's not going anywhere.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:56.950
This is like
an industrial construction site.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.118
It started to look like Blake

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.520
might actually have a chance
at protecting his money.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.723
But even if the 500 grand survives
those tanks, the tanks

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:07.127
are actually only the first
of four phases of attacks

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.428
Blake will have to defend.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:11.865
And believe me when I say this,
they're going to get much more challenging.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.066
For the rest of the night.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.668
Blake and his crew worked tirelessly
to defend the money,

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.438
but by the time the sun rose,
they still weren't quite done.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:19.939
Looking good. Looking good.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.611
That's the money.
The tanks are over there.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:25.912
What is this car here for?

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:27.947
This is like my inventory back
here, dude.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:30.116
Put your inventory
between the money and the tank.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.152
Give me 10 minutes.
And that white car will be ready.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.186
I mean, you have 5 minutes.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:38.791
I don't think I
even have time to do anything else.

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.960
Time is up. Stop stop, time is up.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.362
Drop it. Drop it right there.

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.997
Go far away.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.866
Blake, time is officially ended.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:50.036
Seems pretty sturdy.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.371
Let's go fire some tanks.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:54.040
I've been up for about 25 hours now.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.341
Just building and building
and building.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.943
I mean, I'm looking at it now,
and it looks great,

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.546
But then I turn around
and I see these five beasts,

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.481
and then I see these shells
that they're working with.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.283
I really had no idea
they're going to be that big.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:05.285
You think a shipping container is
stopping that?

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:06.553
Hopefully three of them are.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:07.287
Oh, man.

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.589
All right, it's time.
Load up the tanks.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:10.523
All right.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:14.394
These five tanks aimed at your money
are about to fire 20 rounds.

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:16.329
Blake, fire the first shot.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.367
There’s so much dust.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.571
Oh my Gosh! Look at his face.
Look at Blake's face.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.005
No way his money is safe.

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.440
So only 19 more right?

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.741
19 more to go.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.009
Chandler Fire!

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.692
This is way too much fun.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.294
Oh, my God.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:49.162
All the way back here.

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:50.964
I can count eight holes
in that shipping container.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.098
Yeah, I see those holes.

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:54.601
- No, shot his money is safe.
- I’d ask you how you're feeling.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.236
Well, we might as well fire
the last few shots.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.270
Let's just get this over with.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.905
Five shots.

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:01.474
Four shots remain.

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:04.744
Three shots remain.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.279
How much money do you have back
there?

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:07.547
Like half a…

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:11.551
Two remain.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:14.587
And of course, Blake,
you have to fire the last shell.

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:15.521
The honor is mine.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.757
After this, we'll see
if you have any money left.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:20.660
Let's go.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.562
Oh, he's running. He's so fast.

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:23.963
Is there any money?

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:25.732
Wait, it's still there!

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.000
Yes!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.068
Blake, it looked like
your money survived.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:29.702
We got a fresh stack.

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:30.703
I know you're happy.

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:34.474
We're moving on to phase two of four
and in 24 hours, we’re going to blow up

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:38.044
the biggest bomb we've ever blown up
in our history of the channel

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:38.911
around this money.

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.780
Are you going to drop it
or are you going to shoot it?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.582
I'm glad you asked.
I'll be right back.

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:44.684
Blake, what do you think is
in those green crates?

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.152
I don't know, dude
it looks like…

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:46.853
Here, I’ll answer for you.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:50.857
This is a hundred crates
filled to the brim with TNT.

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.258
How are you even allowed to do that?

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:53.393
I'm not sure it's legal.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:56.195
And while we prepared
one of the biggest explosions

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:57.397
in YouTube history.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.233
Blake began to strategize
on how to keep his money safe.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:03.569
Step one, we got to take everything
flammable out of here, man.

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:04.971
All the wood has got to go.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.873
Step two water tanks.

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:07.340
Step three.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.175
I want to move
the shipping containers that I got.

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:11.511
I just want to close them in
into the other shipping containers.

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:15.415
Then step four is just walls,
cement, bricks, cars, if I have to.

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:17.517
Explosion
is a lot worse than the tanks.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.185
This is bigger than that safe that blew up?

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:22.288
Yes.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.590
Every single
thing inside that, destroyed.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:28.561
The first
time he lost $250,000 in this video.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.730
Are we going to repeat it?

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:32.165
No.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.835
And because at this point, Blake
had been awake for over 24 hours,

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.403
he trusted the construction workers

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:39.539
to finish the job
while he got a good night's rest.

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:42.308
Yeah, I'm going to bed. Good night,
guys. This is Blake going dark.

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:44.277
And because he was so exhausted,

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:46.479
Blake slept for way
longer than he planned.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.281
All right.
I got a good night's sleep.

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:50.883
About to find out how much progress
was really done overnight.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.118
Like half…

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.121
Empty.

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.824
That means nothing has happened
since I've been gone.

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:02.328
And with only 6 hours remaining,
Blake did what he could by covering

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:05.698
his weak spots with spare parts,
bricks and more cars.

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:07.734
Looking good in here, looking real good.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:15.274
- Oh, Mr. Jimmy,
- What am I about to witness?

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:16.943
If you listen closely,
you can hear beeping.

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:18.544
It's actually a school bus
coming in.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:20.646
It's going to be plopped
right where you're standing.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.348
I assume it's not full of children.

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:23.916
It's a short bus.

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.318
That is just not what I asked.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:28.388
Is our brand new, feastable bar,
new flavor, new branding.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.689
- You want to try it, Blake?
- Yeah.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.225
I'm using our snack products

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.227
to distract them from telling them
where to put the bus.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.996
Dude, honestly, this is better
than all the other ones.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.798
- All the other ones.
- I promise.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.867
Anyone want a piece of chocolate?

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.971
Did you get that?

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:48.074
Hey Blake!

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.575
5 minutes till boom.

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:51.844
I need 10 more minutes.
Just give me five extra minutes.

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:53.045
You have four minutes.

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:55.815
- Bro, you spraying them with water.
- Probably feels good.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.216
I don't think they agree.

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:58.985
They're literally
getting off the car.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:00.787
They've got 90 seconds left.

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.889
Blake, you're running out of time.

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.157
Go! Go!

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.891
Come on.

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:05.725
Come on.

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.693
Hey! It’s five o’clock.

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:10.229
Stop, stop, stop,
turn it off, turn it off.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.632
Hey, hey, Blake.
Turn it off

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.534
before I start taking your money.

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:16.436
Let's go over to the bunker.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.604
You narrowly escaped death
from the tanks.

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:20.139
Let's see if you can do it again.

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.542
Let the sun go down
so it's a little darker now.

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:25.945
This is the biggest bomb
we’ve ever set off.

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:28.514
This is the first bomb I’ve ever seen.

00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:29.682
Blake, are you nervous?

00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:31.317
Yeah, I'm sweating now.

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:33.286
This is the detonation device. Here
you go.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:33.953
It's live?

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:34.821
Yes, it's live.

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:39.025
Two days of work, 17
cars, six water jugs

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:43.129
for shipping containers
and $500,000 on the line.

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:46.532
Let's find out if you're going to be
rich or go home with nothing.

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:47.733
When you're ready, Blake.

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:48.835
Three,

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.571
two, one.

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:53.372
Mom, I love you.

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:07.253
Oh my gosh.

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:09.455
That firestorm is massive.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.290
- Can we go put that out?
- Before we go put it out.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.725
I'm just wasting time.

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:13.459
Run!

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:14.727
Grab the fire extinguisher!

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:16.295
Go, go, go, go.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:17.497
Let’s go see if it burns!

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.599
Oh, no.

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.200
Oh, it's on fire over there.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.102
Oh, no.

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:23.769
Be careful of this.

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:29.709
Get off my money.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.177
The fire still going on up front.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.912
Blake is moving sandbags.

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:34.113
Right there should be good.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:35.014
Please don't be ashes.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.349
Please don't be ashes.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.550
What do you see? What do you see?

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:40.119
- I see green!
- Oh, my gosh.

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:42.188
Yeah, baby!
Yeah!

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.558
I see a lot of dirt on it,
but it seems it survived.

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:46.492
Whoa.

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:47.159
I knew it.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:50.162
Blake, you've officially completed
phase two of four.

00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:52.131
Do you want to see
what the next challenge is?

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:53.666
Yes.

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:00.907
All right, Blake, for your third
challenge,

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:04.477
we're going to be dropping
flaming cars filled with gasoline

00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:05.444
on top of your money.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.646
Can you tell me how many cars?

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.080
- A lot.
- A lot?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.282
A lot.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.386
This is going to be the hardest
phase yet.

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:16.656
Not only will Blake have to deflect
the attack from the sky,

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:20.226
but he'll also have to protect his
money from the flammable gasoline

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:22.428
seeping through the cracks
of his defense.

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:24.697
And after we drop the cars,
I have another surprise.

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:26.766
Good luck.

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:30.403
I want the crate with the money
in it to be stuffed with concrete,

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.071
that shipping container
that's just sitting.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.673
Plop that on top of the money.

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.041
Since Blake had been working

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:38.311
so hard for the past few days,
he ended up going right to sleep

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:40.313
and saved most of his work
the next day.

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.548
And although he seemed confident,
this challenge

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:44.617
would soon prove itself
to be more difficult

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:47.553
than anything
he's ever faced in these videos.

00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:49.956
- Let’s go Blake!
- Come on, Blake!

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:52.425
Alright, this is day four.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.793
I'm feeling like a zombie.

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:55.995
We're going to take the other
shipping container that I have.

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:58.097
We're going to pick that up
and we're going to put it

00:09:58.097 --> 00:10:02.368
in a formation to where the point is
facing up, so it’s like a pyramid.

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:05.438
The cars will hit it, doom and fall, but
not on the money.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.907
We've got to get that shipping container
on top as soon as possible.

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:09.575
It’s starting to worry me a
little bit.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:10.610
Over the next few hours.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.511
Blake did everything in his power

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:15.915
to place the top shipping container
at an angle to deflect the cars,

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:18.651
even if that meant using wooden logs
to prop it up.

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:21.654
If this container does not go
exactly where I want to right now,

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:24.657
I'm probably losing a lot of money.

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:27.026
We did it.

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.694
Oh, that makes me feel really good.

00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:30.396
The water tank,
we bring that over to,

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:32.498
like, right
here, fill that thing with bricks,

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:34.166
and then we're going
to take the last car we got.

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.868
Put it right here.

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:38.137
That's going to block
all this is going to look great.

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:39.772
We got a plan, baby.

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:42.608
But what Blake didn't know is
I was about to introduce a twist.

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:44.010
Do you want to know what the twist
is?

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.177
- Yeah.
- Follow me.

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.613
See that flag over there?
That's a catapult.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.449
So as cars fall from the top,
giant flaming balls

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:51.884
are going to be hurled
from the side.

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:54.954
Dude, I’ve been guessing millions
of things I never thought catapult.

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:57.657
I have, like, no more materials.
I have nothing else to use.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.660
Throughout the final hour,
Blake raced to cover the weak spots

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.594
of his fortress.

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:03.729
However, there was still a key
part missing.

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:04.764
His water truck,

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:07.767
which he sent to refill in
the morning, was painfully late.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.535
He has 90 seconds left.

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:10.469
Alright, here we go.

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:13.005
As always it comes down to the wire
with Blake.

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:16.375
60, 59, 58,

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:19.478
54, He's
drenching everything in water

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:22.682
before he drop the car to try
to protect the money from the fire.

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:24.250
30 seconds remain.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.252
You really think this is going
to stop the fire?

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.453
Oh, yeah, baby.

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:30.389
Three, two, one. Drop it.

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:32.758
Just for that.

00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:34.860
I'm not showing mercy
on the last one.

00:11:34.894 --> 00:11:36.762
- You knew that was going to happen, dude.
- That was intentional.

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:38.330
Oh man, moment of truth.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.032
Look how high up that bad boy is.

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:42.802
This is only the first of five
flaming cars.

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:43.969
We're going to be dropping.

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:46.939
On top of the five flaming death balls
from the catapult.

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:48.474
- You ready? Blake?
- Get this going, dude.

00:11:48.674 --> 00:11:49.475
Light it on fire!

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:54.180
Now drop it.

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.114
Oh, no.

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:56.916
Oh my Gosh!

00:11:58.951 --> 00:11:59.285
Hold on.

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:00.953
Everything is actually setting
on fire right now.

00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:03.622
The burning car successfully
rolled off the container.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.858
However, the wood
that Blake used to prop it up

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:07.560
quickly engulfed in flames.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.162
Dude, what's going on?

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:12.098
What is happening?

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:13.899
What in there is on fire, Blake?

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:14.400
I don't.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.001
I don't even know what to say.

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:17.770
What was on top
of the shipping container?

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.238
All right, there is wood there.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.539
Let’s not jinx it.

00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:21.607
Knock on wood.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.541
You put wood?

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:24.777
And you knew we are
dropping flaming cars?

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:26.212
I needed to use them, dude.

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:27.146
Luckily, Blake

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:29.381
did surround his money
with cinderblocks,

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:32.918
so there's still a very high
likelihood his money is unburned.

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:36.021
And since we're about to go
into the coolest part of this video,

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:39.024
obviously now I'm going to tell you
about ACORNS.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:40.760
Their debit card is meant to help

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.728
you grow your money,
not just spend it,

00:12:42.728 --> 00:12:45.164
which I'll tell you
more about in a second, fire!

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:51.937
ACORNS just launched
the new Mighty Oak debit card.

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.472
They made with Dwayne Johnson

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:55.441
Cool thing about this
debit card is every time

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:56.242
you make a purchase,

00:12:56.242 --> 00:12:57.409
it automatically rounds up

00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:59.512
to the nearest dollar
and invest the difference for you.

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:03.182
Believe it or not, your money
is also under attack, not by flaming

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:06.752
death balls, but by things like
bills, spending and inflation.

00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:08.487
Which is why
when you're not spending

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:09.789
your money, you'll be hard at work

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.224
in two of the highest APYs
available.

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:13.759
Chandler, what does APYs mean?

00:13:16.595 --> 00:13:18.964
It means you can fight back against
bills and inflation

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:21.700
by growing your money,
 just by having it in your account.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.302
Blake, how are you doing, buddy?

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:25.704
I'm remembering what it feels like
to lose one of these things.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.241
Oh, it's a direct hit.

00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:30.142
Right on the money.

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:33.646
Just from signing
up, ACORNS and I are giving you $20

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:34.580
to start growing your money.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.316
So go to acorns.com/mrbeast

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:39.618
To learn about how you can
make your money work for you.

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:41.120
Light it on fire!

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:43.689
Drop it.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.096
The rain of fire
continued all throughout the night.

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:53.032
Oh, oh.

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:56.769
And as the flames only grew bigger,
things started to look really

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.304
bleak for Blake's money.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.471
No, no, no.

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:02.208
That fire was raging for over
an hour and a half.

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:04.743
It's either all going to be there
or it's not going to be there at all.

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:07.179
That right there is a bunch
of logs of wood.

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:09.782
He accidentally created
a giant bonfire.

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:11.450
He thought he was making a fortress,

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.918
but he was actually
making a furnace.

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:15.955
I mean, there's still a chance
the concrete protected the money.

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:19.425
Blake, moment of truth.
Did your cinderblocks

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:22.862
protect your money
or was the fire just too much?

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:25.264
Oh, my God.

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:26.799
Oh, no.

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.168
Oh. Oh,

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:31.003
Those are ruined.

00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:33.572
Wait, hold up. The money is
fried.

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:37.509
It's a thousand degrees in there.

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:39.345
Let’s be real with ourselves, Blake.

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:43.582
It's gone.

00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:46.418
As you saw,
most of the money looks like this.

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:48.420
Another loss.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.756
Yeah. This one hurts
more than the laser one.

00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:54.226
What hurts the most is that I worked
so hard for nothing.

00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:56.862
Yeah, it sucks.

00:14:56.862 --> 00:15:00.032
The challenge is officially over.

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:03.102
And before you go, Blake,
I have an offer for you.

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.570
You have two choices.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.807
You can either walk away with
$100,000, or you could get a third

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:11.610
and final chance
to compete in a future video.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.882
- All right, I'm coming back.
- You're coming back?

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:17.516
I'm coming back.

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:18.350
Okay.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.818
Blake's last chance to win

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:23.889
a video is going to be right here,
but it won't be out until February.

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:25.491
I don't think me, the audience.

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.693
Everyone can bear to see
you lose a third time.

00:15:27.826 --> 00:15:30.129
I'll see you then.
