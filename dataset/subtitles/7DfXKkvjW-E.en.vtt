00:00:00.077 --> 00:00:03.000
(upbeat music)

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.410
- So this smartwatch

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.410
has one really interesting
trick up its sleeve

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.470
that I haven't seen in any
other, and that, honestly,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.910
I don't think we're ever gonna see again.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.560
So at this point we know

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.780
what a smartwatch is already, right?

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.300
This is a stable, mature category.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.130
They deliver mostly across the board

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.720
on all the same functions.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.510
And aside from the one crazy trick,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.130
this one is no exception.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.960
This is the OnePlus Watch 2,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.910
three years after the
original OnePlus Watch

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.230
and it costs 300 bucks.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.820
So for the $300 you're spending,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.370
you're getting a pretty
nice circular watch design.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.760
It comes in this black or
silver stainless steel body

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.170
and a sapphire cover glass

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.830
over a 1.4 inch, 60 hertz AMOLED display.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.660
Design-wise, you could argue

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.940
it takes cues from maybe the OnePlus 11

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.770
or the OnePlus 12 with
the way the camera bump

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.660
is melted into the side rail of the phone.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.770
They've done a similar thing here

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.660
with the buttons on the side of the watch.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.760
So there's a circular button at the top

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.220
and this rectangular button at the bottom.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.780
And I kind of like it. It's a nice shape.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.480
It's got this little
subtle, classy variation

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.220
of just the pure circle.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.960
And then the back looks
pretty standard too.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.630
You got the four pins at the
top, those are for charging.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.980
And it has all the sensors you'd expect

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.660
for a smartwatch in the middle,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.130
optical heart rate sensor,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.320
pulse oximeter for blood oxygen,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.570
and of course, it still has
the interchangeable bands,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.560
same as gen one.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.100
And the whole thing is actually both IP 68

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.050
dust and water resistant

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.980
and reaches a US military
standard for durability.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.650
Basically means it can also
withstand extreme temperature

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.610
and moisture

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.500
and shock among other things.
(watch taps)

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.540
It's not too heavy,
it's built pretty well.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.600
This display goes up to a
thousand nits peak brightness.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.050
So it looks good. It's
built well across the board.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.330
Nice. So what's the catch?

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.470
What's the weird twist?

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.870
Well at the beginning I
mentioned like we already

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.210
kind of know what a smartwatch is,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.690
which is a tiny computer on
your wrist with a tiny screen

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.220
and a tiny battery.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.053
And that's fine.

00:01:57.053 --> 00:02:00.090
Like they all tend to have
pretty short battery lives

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.440
just because they're so small,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.360
and so you kind of just
charge 'em every day.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.230
And that's the way it is.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.500
Like the main competitors
here are the Apple Watch,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.760
which is 18 hours,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.200
although that's not the
most direct competitor

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.040
'cause that's the iPhone.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.010
But the Galaxy Watch, one of the best,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.080
40 hours of battery,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.360
and the Pixel Watch, the newest one,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.770
24 hours of battery life.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.540
But this one, OnePlus
is claiming 100 hours.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.760
100 hour battery life in Smart Mode,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.200
which is not the battery saving mode,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.700
it's actually the
default mode out the box.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.650
100 hours.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.380
So 96 hours is four days.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.060
I feel like, you know, 100 sounds cooler

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.080
so they just went with 100.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.040
But four days of battery
sounds a lot less inconvenient.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.050
So, you know, I had to
put that to the test.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.550
So for the past four straight days

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.650
I've been that guy walking around

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.990
with both an Apple Watch Ultra,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.750
which claims 36 hours of normal use

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.710
and this thing.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.810
Doing all the same stuff
with both watches on,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.210
getting notifications, doing workouts,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.980
just poking around the UI.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.040
And by the end, I was actually
very impressed with both.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.680
So the $800 Apple Watch Ultra

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.190
actually over performed the
36 claimed hours for me.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.310
By hour 56 it was about ready to die.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.570
Now meanwhile, the OnePlus
Watch had about 15% left.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.410
Now you're probably thinking, wait,

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.560
that's not even close to
100, it's like 50 something.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.000
But OnePlus told me that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.460
if you turn the always on display off,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.440
that's good for two more
days of battery life,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.610
it's actually off by default.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.260
I turned it on for this test,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.430
but that would get you well
over the 100 hour mark.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.720
To be fair, that's also probably true

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.190
about the Apple Watch Ultra.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.260
Now one detail to consider
that I think actually mattered

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.430
for this particular test.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.960
I've been wearing hoodies a lot

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.850
'cause it's that type of weather.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.540
And so even with the sleeves
on this Chevron Hoodie,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.890
which I'll link it below

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.930
'cause you probably wanna check it out.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.520
It covers the watch.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.560
And so when you cover the
watch with your sleeve,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.820
it thinks it's in the dark

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.990
'cause the light sensors are covered

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.080
so it turns the brightness
way down on the watch.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.270
And so I think that's why it outperformed

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.860
the battery numbers that it's claiming

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.750
is 'cause I had a sleeve
over it a lot of the times

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.890
and the brightness was low.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.250
But even still, this $300 watch

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.480
outperformed this $800 smartwatch
just in terms of battery.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.650
Now here's the thing.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.250
The way that they're
achieving this battery life

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.070
is, I think, more interesting
than the battery life itself.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.150
This is the twist.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.090
See, most smart watches
have a chip inside,

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.170
computing everything,

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.140
with some high powered cores
and some high efficiency cores

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.600
to balance out power and battery life.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.160
This watch has two entirely
separate processors

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.080
and two different operating systems

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.910
running for each of them.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.880
So there's a high powered
Snapdragon W5 inside,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.890
that's powering Wear OS 4

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.340
and that only lights up for
things connected to that.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.850
Then there's also a BES 2,700 chip

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.060
that is always on and runs RTOS.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.850
And they both share the
same 32 gigs of base storage

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.170
and two gigs of RAM.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.340
So Wear OS kicks on for
the more intensive tasks

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.070
like maps or music playback.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.050
But the RTOS that's always on

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.330
is for those basic, low power tasks:

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.310
heart rate monitoring, phone calls,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.200
notifications, background stuff.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.210
It's like a hybrid car.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.800
It's really interesting.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.780
And a fully electric car,
you guys already know

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.120
has all the benefits of
being really responsive

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.310
but not the best range.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.350
But a gas car has a ton of range,

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.390
just not as responsive as fully electric.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.360
So if you get a hybrid,
best of the both worlds,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.640
responsive and range.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.720
And this watch, it's a hybrid
with the best of both worlds,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.060
responsiveness and range.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.260
So I've been pretty impressed.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.390
You know, using this
thing, it's responsive.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.970
It has a ton of watch faces.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.560
There's a lot of custom workouts

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.200
which look very familiar with tracking

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.000
and everything that
still sends all the data

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.760
to the OHealth app in
plenty of detail for me.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.400
I do still wish now, shoveling
snow was a workout type,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.570
but that's another story.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.150
But you know, these here are
regular weightlifting workouts.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.910
And also, can I say I
really like that it is

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.150
hold to end the workout, not tap to end.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.700
So it's way harder to
accidentally stop a workout.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.960
Great idea.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.100
Also another weird quirk,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.610
this button here has a crown that rotates.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.340
But that rotation doesn't
actually do anything.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.510
It doesn't change the volume,

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.700
it doesn't scroll up or down in anything.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.320
It does nothing. It's not
connected to anything.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.610
It just freely spins.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.350
apparently, that's
literally just to make it

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.570
more durable upon impact.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.850
Doesn't serve any function.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.740
Also, it does have this weird hitch,

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.840
that it hasn't really
gotten any less annoying,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.580
which is if I get a notification,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.230
I feel the buzz on my wrist,

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.850
then I lift up my wrist

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.070
and it takes like a full two seconds

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.440
to show me the notification I just got.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.010
Not that two seconds is a
disaster, it's not a ton of time,

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.230
but it's longer than you expect,

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.360
and it kind of annoys me to have to wait

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.680
in comparison to other watches,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.960
which will just show me the
notification right away.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.210
And I feel like you can
actually see the moment

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.640
that it fires up the Snapdragon W5

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.580
and Wear OS kind of snaps
on right in front of you

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.290
before it shows you that notification.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.123
It's very odd.

00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:06.600
But here's the other twist on top of

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.460
everything we've already talked about.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.220
I don't think this dual chip system

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.030
is all of the magic creating
this great battery life,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.240
because this watch also has
a 500 MilliAmp hour battery.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.010
Now 500 MilliAmp hours
doesn't sound like a lot,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.740
but here's the sizes
of other smart watches

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.960
in competition with this
and their battery sizes

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.910
and how long they last.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.800
And it's a little bigger
than you'd expect.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.500
Now if I gave the Pixel Watch 2,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.140
which also has a
Snapdragon W5, by the way.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.620
If I gave the Pixel Watch 2
a 500 MilliAmp hour battery,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.670
do we think it would last 50 hours?

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.280
I don't know, but there you go.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.210
Honestly, at the end of the day

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.340
I just came away from
this mostly just impressed

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.000
that they actually kept the
price of this watch so low.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.610
Because two chips and two OSs

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.440
and the work that goes into that,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.240
I dunno, to me that just sounds expensive

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.910
and it's really not missing
anything else too drastic.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.640
I think it's competitive in a
lot of good ways at 300 bucks.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.920
So I think the clear positives would be:

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.100
a nice design, really classy
looking design, nice display,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.040
dual frequency GPS, so
that's for better accuracy,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.040
and then of course
really good battery life.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.410
The four days we talked about is awesome,

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.880
but if you put on power saver mode,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.280
it's up to 12 days of battery life.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.250
Now this is gonna disable a
lot of the Wear OS things,

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.000
so it's just basic stuff,
exercises, heart rate monitoring,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.760
but you could get it to really
last a week if you wanted to.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.960
But then the weaknesses are

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.810
definitely the delay in
checking your notifications.

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.880
The haptics also aren't that nice,

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.110
and there's no iPhone compatibility,

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.790
but you already knew that.

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:42.900
But I would also say the
charger is not that cool.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.920
Honestly, it's kind of clunky.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.960
I mean it works perfectly
fine, don't get me wrong,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.760
but it's just like a big plastic block

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.560
with pins and magnets in it.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.080
But it'll get you a full
day's charge in 10 minutes

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.180
and a full charge in an hour.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.110
So that's acceptable.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.950
But for 300 bucks, I'd say
OnePlus has redeemed itself

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.810
from its previous
efforts in smart watches.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.643
It's pretty good.

00:09:01.643 --> 00:09:03.090
Like in a world of smartwatch gimmicks,

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.490
there's the one with earbuds inside,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.740
there's the one for fitness,

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.810
there's the one for the iPhone.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.840
Maybe this is the one
with the hybrid system

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.336
and pretty good battery life.

00:09:15.336 --> 00:09:16.920
(upbeat music)
Maybe that's enough for you.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.510
Let me know in the comments below.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.430
Either way, that's been it.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.600
Thanks for watching.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.836
Catch you the next one. Peace.

00:09:23.836 --> 00:09:26.503
