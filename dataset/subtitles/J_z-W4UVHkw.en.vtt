00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:03.169
Behind me is one person
from every country on Earth.

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:06.381
We're going to see
which country is the best

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.098
because I flew all of them here

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:11.710
to compete in the most extreme
version of the Olympics ever created.

00:00:11.753 --> 00:00:14.581
We have track archery, gymnastics,

00:00:14.623 --> 00:00:17.265
soccer and fencing,
but only one country

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:21.271
is going to walk away with this
$250,000 gold medal.

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.565
Are you ready for the first event?

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.152
You have 30 seconds
to get across these three hurdles

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:30.613
that get bigger and bigger before
this giant wall closes you out.

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.407
All right, here we go.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:35.410
Three, two, one, go!

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:38.206
The first challenge
of the Beast Olympics has begun.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.291
Hurry!
You got to run faster than that.

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:43.137
Oh, they're sprinting.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:45.796
This is insanity.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.965
The wall is closing fast.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.425
You better hurry.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.307
Bro, look at it.
They're like zombies.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.979
Looks like an army of people.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.516
First place! Look at first place!

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.795
He made that look easy.

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.336
We got one!
Indonesia got in first place.

00:01:02.775 --> 00:01:03.780
Let's go!

00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:06.747
They're competing
for this gold medal.

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:09.917
Move! Move!

00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:12.547
Hurry up.
The wall is closing!

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.364
You got to jump.

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:15.566
There's only 8 seconds left.
Move!

00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:20.034
The walls are almost closed.
Hurry up!

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.465
You guys are all one step
closer to this gold medal.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.759
Let's go, USA.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.132
Indonesia baby, you already know.

00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:35.648
Let's go!
We made it, baby!

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.379
Over half the countries
were eliminated in the first game

00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:41.090
and 97 are moving on.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.077
Come on in.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.988
You guys have no idea
what you're in for.

00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:47.105
I want you all to remember
you're representing your country.

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:49.192
Let's reveal the next event.

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:55.075
Good luck, everybody.
You're going to need it.

00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:59.077
Our next event might be
the craziest set we've ever built.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:00.828
Welcome to Gymnastics!

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:01.685
Of death.

00:02:02.764 --> 00:02:04.432
Send the contestants up.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.459
Each round includes 10 countries

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:10.255
and only the first five people
to make it to this middle platform

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.590
move on. I don't care
if it's the five four over here.

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.843
Or if it's two from there
and three from here.

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.469
Only five are moving on.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.313
Five, four...

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:20.532
skip a few, go!

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:23.226
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:25.995
Oh, they got some speed.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.189
Syria flying through the course!

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.884
Come on. You can do it.

00:02:30.927 --> 00:02:32.024
I believe in you.

00:02:32.088 --> 00:02:33.319
Oh, no.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.601
I believe in you.

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:35.728
Syria!

00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:36.669
Jump! Jump!

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:38.044
We got our first place!

00:02:38.087 --> 00:02:38.587
Let's go!

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:39.420
Oh, my God!

00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:40.476
We got our second one!

00:02:40.707 --> 00:02:42.226
¡Vamos! ¡Vamos!

00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:43.590
Mongolia!

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.707
You got to pass up or you're out.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:46.708
You got it.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:47.417
Oh, my God.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.835
Mongolia! Come on!

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.588
Let's go!

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:53.350
Iraq! Just jump over!

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:55.008
Iraq, bro. Don't let him hold you up!

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:55.633
Oh, wait.

00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:58.197
Go, Iraq! Go, go, go, go!

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:00.986
Oh, my God, he's stepping on him!

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:04.673
Algeria!

00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:05.685
There we go!

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:07.812
Let's go, baby!

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.355
Bring up the next group.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.940
And the beauty of this challenge is

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.610
we let the contestants
pick what order they jump in.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.398
Listen, you guys must decide
who's going last.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.160
No, no. You're not going first.

00:03:16.185 --> 00:03:17.463
You want to sneak, sneak.

00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:18.876
I'm telling you,
I'm going to make go down.

00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:19.866
It's a competition.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:20.325
Okay, great.

00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:21.957
Go!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.120
Come on, come on!

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.830
Oh, my God. Oh, boy.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.916
Don't wait for him. Come on!

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.083
You got to go.

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:30.205
Go.

00:03:31.407 --> 00:03:33.652
Bro, they're stepping over his body.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.197
Bro, they're literally stepping
over everything.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.844
Hey! We got our first finisher.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.846
Get up!

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.765
Dude! This is bonkers.

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.111
Only three spots left.

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.671
There's two spots left.

00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:55.943
My guy!

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.487
Come on, Philippines. Go!

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:00.406
Take it slow.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:02.450
Just take it slow. Oh.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.168
Hey, Argentina!
I don't know if this helps,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.370
but there's one spot left

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.171
and you're the only one
still competing, so...

00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:08.223
So, fight for it!

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.158
Fight, fight, fight. Yes!

00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:12.273
For Messi!

00:04:12.316 --> 00:04:13.283
Messi!

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:15.588
Of the ten people,

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.173
only four made it to the middle.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:18.925
That is crazy.

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:21.135
After our second game,

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:22.888
things got a little crazy.

00:04:25.126 --> 00:04:26.557
Oh no, America!

00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:27.433
Oh, my God.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.671
- America is out!
- America!

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:32.230
Whoa!

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:37.918
Is he going to be in?

00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:39.462
Oh, we lost somebody!

00:04:40.476 --> 00:04:42.001
I'm sorry. We already have five.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.951
If you could just,
you know, just do that.

00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:46.039
I'm sorry.

00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:54.018
And now it's
time for our final round.

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:55.837
Gentlemen,
let me give you one piece of advice.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:56.587
Come a little closer.

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:57.767
Don't fall down there.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.979
Hey, that's a good advice.

00:05:00.157 --> 00:05:00.668
Go!

00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:02.218
All right, slow start.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.220
All right. Ah, yeah.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.555
Oh, oh, oh.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:06.431
Go, go, go, go.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:06.973
Fiji, go.

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:11.811
Not very graceful.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.271
He's still there, though.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.684
- There you go.
- You got it, Samoa.

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:15.613
Now you can walk.

00:05:15.664 --> 00:05:17.041
Yes! Yes!

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:18.818
Do it for your country.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.279
- Fiji. Do it for the water.
- Fiji, yes!

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.323
Oh, no.

00:05:26.024 --> 00:05:27.146
Let it go, my man.

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:31.384
All right, Samoa.

00:05:32.312 --> 00:05:33.598
There we go.

00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:35.203
Alright! Two spots!

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:36.751
Come on, Papua! Come on!

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:38.314
There we go!

00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:39.965
Let's go!

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.677
And the final five!

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.388
We lost another 50 people

00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:50.725
during gymnastics and are
down to our last 47 countries.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.436
Welcome, boys and one girl.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:56.189
In this challenge,
each contestant gets a bow and arrow.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.692
And if they can hit this target
from this platform, they move on.

00:05:59.798 --> 00:06:01.152
And to make this interesting,

00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:02.802
I'm going to have
you all place one vote

00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:05.890
to make this event more difficult
for a country of your choice.

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:09.786
And for every vote they receive,
the target gets pushed back ten feet.

00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:11.457
My country doesn't like
Israel lowkey.

00:06:11.482 --> 00:06:12.719
A lot of people
don't like them, so...

00:06:12.744 --> 00:06:14.123
I don't like them.

00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:16.751
Germany. You have a history
of trying to conquer everything.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.128
While votes were cast for countries
from all over.

00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:20.797
One country stood out from the rest.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.507
- Who are you voting for?
- Indonesia.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.340
I think Indonesia
is the biggest threat.

00:06:24.382 --> 00:06:24.924
Really?

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:26.260
I don't like Indonesia.

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.335
He hit Indonesia
with a smiley face too.

00:06:28.415 --> 00:06:29.789
I'm starting to see a theme here.

00:06:30.126 --> 00:06:32.004
You see him last round?
He was crazy.

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.869
What is that?

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:33.924
Indonesia.

00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:35.537
Did you draw the country?

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.987
I drew what I thought
was the country.

00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:41.109
All right. Now, first is Guam.
Come on up.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.364
How many votes do you think you got?

00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:43.569
Think I got maybe three?

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.863
- Yeah, three votes.
- Three?

00:06:45.863 --> 00:06:47.281
Wow. You got three.
How do you know?

00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:49.992
I go to the gym.
I'm fit and I'm agile.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.953
This is your first time
with a bow and arrow?

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:54.580
Oh. That was not very promising.
Guam.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:58.084
Guam! Guam! Guam!

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:01.336
Little short.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.794
Any last words?

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.135
I love you too. Monaco.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.219
You got six votes.

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.399
Ooh, la la.

00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:10.948
Bro's got great hair.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:11.764
Thank you, sir.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:14.098
Does great hair
translate into great shots?

00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:21.418
Oh, come on.

00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:22.599
Monaco!

00:07:24.103 --> 00:07:25.278
The prince will be proud.

00:07:25.302 --> 00:07:26.281
All right. Yeah.

00:07:26.354 --> 00:07:27.923
- Are you nervous?
- No, not at all.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.991
If I lost this one,
I'll be super upset.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.203
Oh, no!
We need that.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.957
Robin Hood is here!

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.500
Do me a favor. Feel free to miss.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.711
You'll just lose a $250,000 bet.

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:43.546
- Anything you want to say?
- Thanks for the opportunity.

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.039
Maybe next time.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.886
For my Pacific people.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.599
Azerbaijan.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.908
Come on up!
Believe in yourself.

00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:00.174
Bro, what the...

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:02.113
Do you want Feastable bar
before you shoot it?

00:08:02.156 --> 00:08:03.275
These are Deez Nutz flavor.

00:08:03.315 --> 00:08:05.085
Actually, that's my favorite.

00:08:05.727 --> 00:08:07.201
That's a good chocolate.

00:08:11.873 --> 00:08:14.122
- Yeah!
- He did it for Feastables!

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:15.527
I did it!

00:08:15.783 --> 00:08:17.288
Yeah!

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.206
Are you nervous?

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.082
It's far, but it's not too far.

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:21.918
- I feel like I got it.
- Saudi Arabia.

00:08:21.943 --> 00:08:23.315
You're the only girl remaining,

00:08:23.357 --> 00:08:25.188
and the bow
is literally taller than you.

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:26.219
Yeah.

00:08:31.056 --> 00:08:32.303
That was so close.

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:35.932
All right, Indonesia,
you got 12 votes.

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:38.516
Move that jump back
as far as she goes.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.686
You were the first person
to finish the first round.

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.396
One of the fastest
to finish the second round.

00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:44.106
- You should've seen this coming.
- Yeah, I know.

00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:46.441
This is the farthest
shot of the day by far.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.611
- What do you think of it?
- Not far enough.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.488
- Not far enough.
- I'm kidding.

00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:51.405
Wish me luck.

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:52.436
Wish me luck.

00:08:56.449 --> 00:08:58.801
No, it was just left.

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:00.015
No!

00:09:00.057 --> 00:09:02.222
You got the height,
just to the left.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.210
I'm so sorry, Indonesians.
I tried my best.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.171
I promise I was too big of a threat.

00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:08.798
And with that last elimination,

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.613
we are down to only
16 countries remaining.

00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:12.385
Contestants.

00:09:12.428 --> 00:09:14.846
Come on in. Come on in.

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.849
Congratulations
for making it this far.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.851
And before we do the next event,
I have an offer.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:24.689
Give each of them
a briefcase with ten grand.

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:29.319
That's ten grand.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.488
If you want,
you can walk away with ten grand.

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:35.658
If not, you could throw it in the pit
and compete in the next event.

00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:37.283
So, it's very simple.

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:38.995
Oh, we already got a couple.

00:09:39.082 --> 00:09:40.246
It's a lot of money.

00:09:41.543 --> 00:09:42.248
Here's the thing.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.874
Half of you
are about to get eliminated.

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:46.085
This is your only chance
to walk away with ten grand.

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:47.210
That's a lot of money, but

00:09:47.252 --> 00:09:48.713
I'm pretty confident
I might win this.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:49.655
I came here to win,

00:09:49.697 --> 00:09:51.674
I'm gonna make everybody that's here.

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.801
He looks like somebody
that's going to settle, bro?

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:55.261
- I'll take it.
- You wanna take it?

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:55.845
Yeah.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.222
One person took it.

00:09:57.265 --> 00:09:59.384
- Smartest man here.
- Last one.

00:09:59.427 --> 00:10:01.434
- Fiji, you taking it?
- Yes, sir.

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:03.191
Yeah, Fiji!

00:10:03.233 --> 00:10:06.481
Fiji and Italy.
And now it's time for fencing.

00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:09.525
We let the top finishers from track
choose their opponents.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.695
Each pair will compete in a 1v1
game of fencing.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:15.906
The first person to hit
the other wins.

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:18.075
Liberia.
Choose your fencing opponent.

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:19.031
I'll go Moldova.

00:10:19.073 --> 00:10:21.369
Moldova, go over there
and stand beside Liberia.

00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:22.246
Eritrea.

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.956
Who do you want to go up against?

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:26.541
- The last person.
- Luxembourg.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:29.168
All right, come on over.
We're starting wars over here.

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:30.254
I'm with Tajikistan.

00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:31.589
Tajkistan. Okay.

00:10:31.617 --> 00:10:33.617
- Madagascar.
- Madagascar.

00:10:34.307 --> 00:10:36.309
- Slovenia.
- Hey. You and I, buddy.

00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:37.845
Azerbaijan.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:41.265
First off, Samoa versus Azerbaijan.

00:10:41.265 --> 00:10:43.684
I'm super pumped to bring home
the gold for Samoa.

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.895
I'm not too nervous, actually.

00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:49.273
Oh, boy.

00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:50.024
One of you

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:53.444
will move on to compete for this
and the loser will fall in the void.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:54.528
Begin!

00:10:59.354 --> 00:11:00.493
Someone's got to lunge.

00:11:09.455 --> 00:11:10.336
Oh, man.

00:11:12.424 --> 00:11:14.549
- Samoa won!
- Yes!

00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:18.928
And in case you're wondering,
the suits

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.763
they're wearing,
it's rigged with technology

00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:22.890
that will tell us
exactly who gets hit first.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.518
This is the same stuff
they use in the real Olympics.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.520
Make it, man. Make it, man.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.563
Azerbaijan, please stand
in front and center.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.316
You've been eliminated.

00:11:32.274 --> 00:11:34.902
Next up, Iraq versus Madagascar.

00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:36.363
Begin!

00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:37.780
Everything's on the line.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.698
Let's see it, Iraq.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.783
It feels so weird to name people
by their country.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.995
Oh, well, no, nothing so far.

00:11:46.277 --> 00:11:48.321
- This is intense.
- I know.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.963
Iraq won!

00:11:54.697 --> 00:11:55.882
Let's go!

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.550
Well deserved, bro.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.677
I love you, man. I'm sorry.

00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:01.220
- I love you.
- Madagascar.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.680
You are eliminated.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.267
Slovenia versus Monaco.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.185
- Begin!
- Oh, Monaco running in.

00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:12.064
And while they're fighting. Oh, oh.

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:13.962
I want to tell you guys
about Stumble Guys,

00:12:14.004 --> 00:12:15.340

where 32 people compete

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.281
- Oh, my God.

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:22.491

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:24.950

Oh, no, hit.

00:12:31.528 --> 00:12:32.291
Win!

00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:34.926
I tried my best for Monaco,
but it is what it is.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.507
Next up, Moldova versus Liberia.

00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:39.842
Begin! In Stumble Guys

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:41.802

00:12:44.192 --> 00:12:46.182
He's getting backed up.
Kris, watch out, Kris.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.642
We have a new Mr. Beast skin,
Mr. Beast emote.

coming soon in the future...

00:12:56.817 --> 00:12:59.361
I think I literally saw a spark.
To PlayStation and Xbox.

Make sure you act quick
to get the free Mr. Beast skin.

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:05.201
This is intense.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.412
Moldova!

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.247
No, Liberia!

00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:13.793
And now for our final game,
Libya versus Montenegro.

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.085
They will be fighting over
what they're competing for.

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:19.723
Oh, I wish you the best of luck,
but no mercy.

00:13:19.825 --> 00:13:20.549
Begin!

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:22.510
- Don't trip on the medal.
- Trip on the medal,

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.039
it's funny.

00:13:23.081 --> 00:13:24.428
It's fine we step here, right?

00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:25.555
What?

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.368
Come here. Come here.

00:13:28.411 --> 00:13:29.809
He's saying come and get some.

00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:31.561
That focus.

00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:35.439
Oh, and the winner is Libya.

00:13:37.036 --> 00:13:39.610
Libya is moving on.
Montenegro, I'm sorry.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.111
It's a pleasure to fight you.

00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:41.895
Drop him.

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:43.280
And with that,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.278
I'm going to grab the gold medal
and we're off to the final event.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.954
So far, you've seen people
from every country compete in track,

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:53.833
gymnastics, archery, fencing,

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:57.320
and now it's time
for the final event,

00:13:57.362 --> 00:13:58.503
penalty kicks.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:13:59.630
The rules are simple.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.383
You kick the ball into the goal
and you move on to the next round.

00:14:02.716 --> 00:14:04.609
But if you miss, you're out.

00:14:04.651 --> 00:14:07.053
The seven countries
remaining are Slovenia,

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:12.143
Moldova, Tajikistan, Eritrea,
Libya, Iraq, and Samoa.

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.394
I kept thinking in my head, great.

00:14:13.437 --> 00:14:16.317
Like I gave up a $10,000 suitcase.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.692
I trusted myself.
I believe in myself and I did it.

00:14:18.735 --> 00:14:20.547
Just want to say
there were some doubters in here

00:14:20.589 --> 00:14:22.278
because of my age. But you know what?

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.612
Don't judge a book by its cover.

00:14:23.612 --> 00:14:24.697
I'm doing this for Iraq.

00:14:27.157 --> 00:14:27.950
Let's go!

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.535
I'm trying to win for my wife.

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:32.204
Bring out the contestants.
Come on in.

00:14:35.624 --> 00:14:36.645
Just a reminder,

00:14:36.688 --> 00:14:40.711
one of you is about to receive
this $250,000 gold medal.

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:42.382
Who wants to kick first?

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.383
I'll kick.

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:47.803
Okay, Slovenia is up first.

00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:49.096
This should be easy.

00:14:49.096 --> 00:14:51.140
I'd be shocked if he missed it.

00:14:52.552 --> 00:14:54.727
Yeah! Sure,

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:56.646
the first round was easy,

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.149
but that's not going to last
very long.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:02.985
Now that everyone made a goal.

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.731
- Do you know what's happening?
- I know what's happening.

00:15:04.774 --> 00:15:06.196
Chandler, bring it on out!

00:15:07.614 --> 00:15:09.575
The real challenge starts now.

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:11.535
It's about to get a lot harder.

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.454
I think this is where
we'll lose our first person.

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:15.414
- That's too tight.
- So much on the line.

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:16.415
I thought it was going to be easy.

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:17.958
It's only like six foot wide.

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.293
Someone's getting out.

00:15:19.714 --> 00:15:20.961
Come on, Slovenia!

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:22.922
Hype them up, everybody!

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:30.346
Even though we made the goal smaller,
they were still scoring.

00:15:32.323 --> 00:15:34.809
We're going to have
to make this much more difficult.

00:15:39.768 --> 00:15:40.606
Nobody's missing.

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.442
Eventually, someone's got to miss.

00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:47.653
- Oh, no!
- The first miss.

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:49.573
I'm sorry, man.
But you're eliminated.

00:15:49.573 --> 00:15:51.075
That hurts.

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:53.911
I don't know where he ran to.

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.788
And now only six remain.

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.091
Instead of adding more walls,

00:15:57.133 --> 00:15:59.291
we're just going to move
them like this a little bit.

00:16:00.768 --> 00:16:02.336
It needs to be one Chandler wide.

00:16:03.253 --> 00:16:05.089
All right.
Slovenia, you're up.

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.967
- Yeah.
- Wow.

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:11.053
The heat just doesn't stop.

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:12.263
Take your time.

00:16:16.346 --> 00:16:17.851
They're dropping like flies.

00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:19.536
I could have done better, but

00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:21.480
it was the best five days of my life.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:22.654
This is getting harder now.

00:16:22.696 --> 00:16:24.066
Yeah, this is a competition.

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:25.818
And now only five remain.

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.361
I'm going to win you!

00:16:31.503 --> 00:16:32.533
Yeah, baby!

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:34.284
All right, Samoa. You're up.

00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:35.870
It could all come down to this.

00:16:35.909 --> 00:16:37.287
The fans think it's Samoa.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:39.290
Samoa! Samoa!

00:16:44.112 --> 00:16:44.920
It hit the X.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.296
Obviously, it's disappointing

00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:48.465
not to be able to win,
but it was phenomenal.

00:16:48.465 --> 00:16:50.009
I think I did my people proud.

00:16:56.868 --> 00:16:58.226
I'm sorry, man.

00:17:00.644 --> 00:17:03.313
Every country on the planet
has competed in these games.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.565
And we're now on our final two,
Libya and Slovenia.

00:17:06.608 --> 00:17:11.321
One of you is going to walk away
with this $250,000 gold medal.

00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:12.818
Jimmy is going to do a plot twist.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.073
It's a big one.

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.160
Boys, can you remove the walls?

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:18.495
Instead of walls

00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:20.480
You each are going to take turns
being goalkeepers.

00:17:20.523 --> 00:17:21.330
Yes.

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.460
We go until someone scores
and someone doesn't.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.879
- Pretty simple.
- I'm going to catch it.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.047
I'm nervous.

00:17:31.752 --> 00:17:33.323
- That faked me out.
- That faked me out.

00:17:33.365 --> 00:17:34.386
He's ice cold.

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:36.639
Well, after that,
now he has to make it.

00:17:42.128 --> 00:17:44.480
- He blocked it!
- Yeah!

00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:45.606
Yeah!

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:50.527
If you make this shot,
you officially win our Olympics.

00:17:50.527 --> 00:17:52.029
I can't believe this.

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.865
All you have to do is make the shot
and you've won.

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:56.409
I'm going to win.

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:11.744
Yeah!

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.218
Yeah!

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:16.012
Yeah!

00:18:16.893 --> 00:18:18.306
Yes, I win!

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:19.849
It's 20 pounds be careful.

00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:22.184
The golden medal.
I can't believe this.

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:25.688
You can probably sell this
for $250,000 tomorrow.

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:27.397
And Slovenia gets silver.

00:18:27.397 --> 00:18:30.274
- Silver is my color, though.
- Congratulations!

00:18:30.317 --> 00:18:32.611
Amazing!

00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:34.947
And that's it for first Olympics.

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.857
Not only did they get these medals,

00:18:36.899 --> 00:18:39.362
but everyone who competed got $2,000.

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:41.662
I hope you enjoyed.
See you in the next video.

00:18:42.018 --> 00:18:43.721
This is for Libya!
