00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.233
- [Will] That's hot.
(bright upbeat music)

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:07.080
- All right, so this is
simultaneously really impressive

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.740
and really frightening at the same time,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.690
and it's hitting me in ways
that I didn't really expect.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.180
So do you remember Will
Smith eating spaghetti?

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.320
Do you remember when this

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.390
was what AI generated videos looked like?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.947
Remember when we said, "Okay,
this AI stuff is cool and all

00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:22.987
"but clearly there's a long way to go

00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:25.620
"before there's any need for concern."

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.510
Well, welcome to the future people

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.100
because this is also
an AI generated video.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.130
And so is this, completely
synthesized out of thin air

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.450
by computers.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.330
This one too, this is not real.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.560
Absolutely ridiculous

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.380
how far we've come in literally one year.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.380
This does feel like another
ChatGPT, DALL.E moment for AI.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.550
And maybe I'm overreacting

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.310
because, okay, I am a video creator,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.460
so an AI that's actually doing my job,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.050
maybe that feels a little more threatening

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.580
so I'm particularly impressed by it.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.310
But also this stuff is really good.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.270
So today, Sam Altman and
OpenAI announced a new model

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.520
called Sora and it can generate

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.140
full up to one minute video
clips from just text input.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.340
So the same way DALL.E was able
to understand our text input

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.680
and turn it into a photorealistic

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.050
or stylized image or whatever you want,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.770
same thing with Sora but
now since it's videos,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.110
it also needs to understand

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.350
how all these things like
reflections and textures

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.250
and materials and physics
all interact with each other

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.770
over time to make a
reasonable looking video.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.870
And of course, right away,
there's a bunch of examples

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.190
on their website that are crazy.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.360
Now, before I show you these,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.010
I just need you to keep this in mind,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.370
you're about to watch a
bunch of AI generated videos

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.950
and you know that you're about to watch

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.360
a bunch of AI generated content.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.940
So your brain, you're already
looking for this stuff

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.120
and it's not perfect, you
will find imperfections,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.660
but not everybody who
sees AI generated content

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.080
on the internet knows
to be looking for that.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.270
So also keep that in mind.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.490
This is also the worst
that this technology

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.470
is going to be from here on out.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.060
So, okay, here's one of the videos.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.740
There's no audio to any of these clips,

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.240
but the prompt for this one

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.630
is a stylish woman walks
down a Tokyo street

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.110
filled with warm, glowing,
neon and animated city signage.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.910
She wears a black leather jacket,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.820
a long red dress and black boots.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.960
This video is already miles
ahead of where we were.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.780
It has accurate lighting,
it has materials,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.180
it has skin tones, movements,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.760
even has reflections all over the place.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.990
Now, of course, if you look at it

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.480
for more than about 10
seconds, very closely,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.860
there are lots of giveaways.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.120
Like this dude in the background

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.330
kinda looks like he's
gliding in a weird way.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.130
The frame rates and the
reflections in the water

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.740
are for some reason lower
than the rest of the video.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.900
The camera movement overall
is just a bit inconsistent

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.100
and it just, I don't know,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.800
it just kinda feels a little bit off.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.670
But then again, this is
where we were one year ago.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.610
So just keep that in the back
of your head for all this.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.443
Okay, how about this one?

00:03:06.443 --> 00:03:08.940
This is another one
which has a long prompt

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.330
about a camera following
behind a white vintage SUV

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.650
with a black roof rack as it's
speeds up a steep dirt road.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.130
This is also, again, really good.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.900
It kinda looks a little more video gamey

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.750
because of how rock solid
the drone footage is,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.150
but clearly very usable.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.080
Here's another one,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.350
a litter of golden retriever
puppies playing in the snow.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.500
Their heads pop in and out
of the snow covered in it,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.333
it's so good.

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:37.800
It feels like the physics
of the fur and the ears

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.430
and everything with the snow
flying around in slow motion

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.263
is incredible.

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:43.800
I've looked through all
of the sample videos

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.060
on OpenAI's website,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.000
and clearly these are
the handpicked best ones

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.170
that they chose to share

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.670
where they just put in some text

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.920
and then get a video and don't modify it.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.240
But there's really
impressive stuff in there.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.070
Some of it has humans, some of it doesn't.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.290
Some of it is more realistic feeling

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.460
like the truck driving one,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.850
but some of them are more
video gamey or more stylized.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.990
A lot of it is slow motion,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.630
I just have to say how insanely fast

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.990
these models are improving is genuinely,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.340
like that's the shocking part.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.000
Like I remember not even that
many months ago, DALL-E 3,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.680
really, really high end,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.440
and you could always still
find something off about it.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.700
Like especially if you ask it

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.350
for something like a
photorealistic image of a human,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.320
something about like the hands or the ears

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.450
would always just be a little bit off,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.470
nevermind the physics.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.030
But even this video here
is crazy at first glance.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.800
The prompt for this AI generated video

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.720
is a young man in his 20s

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.380
is sitting on a piece of a
cloud in the sky reading a book.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.940
This one feels like 90%
of the way there for me.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.830
Like it's beyond the uncanny valley

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.300
of like apple's personas,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.340
which are actually based on humans.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.930
This is a made up person.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.310
I mean, his eyes are kinda weird,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.490
and the motion of the pages
in the book are kinda odd.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.402
And yeah, obviously, he's in
a cloud and that's a giveaway

00:05:01.402 --> 00:05:05.460
but like, the lighting and
the shadows and the skin tones

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.590
and then all the realism of
the textures on the shirt

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.930
and the way the shirt and
the pants move and the hair,

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.790
they're all really impressive.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.780
And then for this one,

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.090
they typed in a movie trailer

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.080
featuring the adventurers
of the 30-year old spaceman

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.190
wearing a red wool knitted
motorcycle helmet, blue sky,

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.190
salt desert, cinematic style,
shot on 35 millimeter film.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.090
And the closeups of his face,
the fabrics on the helmet,

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.390
the film grain through every
shot and the cinematic style,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.260
this is one of the most
convincing AI generated videos

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.990
I've ever seen, minus
maybe the weird physics

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.240
of that dude walking
kind of in fast motion.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.830
So Sam Altman, if you
follow him on Twitter,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.910
he's going through a whole bunch more

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.740
of like people's requests

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.840
and posting a bunch more generated videos.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.070
And so if you wanna check out his profile,

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.903
you can see those.

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:58.530
But here's the thing about
these AI generated videos now,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.530
as good as they've gotten to this point,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.380
they can and will pass as real videos

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.900
to people who are not looking
for AI generated videos.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.140
Now that is obviously insanely sketchy

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.880
during an election year in the U.S.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.780
and also terrifying

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.850
for a bunch of other
internet related reasons

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.290
but it's also perfect for stock footage.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.680
Like there are already
all kinds of presentations

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.440
and advertisements and then PowerPoints

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.090
that are in need of oddly
specific stock videos.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.040
And these AI generated videos
are already good enough

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.830
to 100% pass for that purpose.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.930
Like look at this one,
this one with the waves

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.420
at Big Sur, this drone shot.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.820
Honestly, if I saw this on Twitter,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.930
I wouldn't even think twice.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.790
I'd be like, "Oh, nice drone shot, dude."

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.670
Wouldn't even think about
AI if I wasn't pixel peeping

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.560
at like the way the water was moving.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.010
Like this is a totally
usable video in an ad

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.080
for some California based product.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.100
And that has all sorts of
implications for the drone pilot

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.200
that no longer needs to be hired,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.630
for all the photographers
and videographers

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.570
whose footage no longer
needs to be licensed

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.970
to show up in that ad that's being made.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.650
It's already that good.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.050
There's other stuff like this wall of TVs,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.840
which would be a totally
expensive and difficult thing

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.320
to shoot with a camera and
all these old expensive props,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.520
but if you can just generate
it this well with reflections

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.130
and the environment and
everything else around it,

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.960
I mean, why do it any other way?

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.900
It's also very capable of
historical themed footage.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.950
So this is supposed to be
California during the Gold Rush.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.350
It's AI generated but
it could totally pass

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.180
for the opening scene in an old Western

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.530
with the right music over it.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.880
How long until an entire ad,

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.090
every single shot is
completely generated with AI?

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.510
Or what about an entire YouTube
video or an entire movie?

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.406
I'm tempted to say like we're
a long way away from that

00:07:56.406 --> 00:07:59.400
because you know, this
still has flaws clearly

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.310
and there's no sound,

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.820
and there's a long way to go
with the prompt engineering

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.950
to iron these things out.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.210
But then again, the spaghetti
was like a year ago.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.430
Now actually like that
OpenAI, on their website,

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.500
they show some of the downfalls too

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.420
of this particular model.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.620
And because who would know better

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.060
than the people who have been using it?

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.220
This is a very private
tool, by the way, right now.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.600
It's in super limited access,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.507
so it's in the hands of red teamers,

00:08:23.507 --> 00:08:26.970
which basically means people
testing it, pushing the limits,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.766
trying to break it, and
a few trusted creators.

00:08:29.766 --> 00:08:33.660
But they have found plenty
of weird edge stuff.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.930
Like this clip here of a
bunch of gray wolf pups

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:37.860
looks normal at first

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.810
but then it's pretty clear
that something's kinda off

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:42.480
with the way they're just
kinda appearing out of nowhere

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.340
and walking through each other.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.480
That's kinda weird.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.790
Or this clip of a guy
running on a treadmill,

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.710
which I mean, I don't
really have to say much more

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.910
about why this one is weird.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.170
But this is my favorite one, again,

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.900
so again, just try to put
yourself in the mind of someone

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.610
who's not expecting AI.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.610
You're just scrolling through Facebook

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.470
or Twitter or something, right?

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.370
So you just see this video.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.750
So first I just want
you to watch this clip

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.670
as if it's just a stock video you found

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.680
of a grandma celebrating her birthday.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.330
And just try to think like,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.490
I wonder what birthday
she's celebrating, right?

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.630
I don't know, how old do you think she is?

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.650
60?

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.483
65?

00:09:14.483 --> 00:09:15.720
Maybe it's the big 70.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.340
She seems to really like that cake.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.650
Now, did you see it?

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.891
Did you catch that?

00:09:20.891 --> 00:09:22.140
I'm gonna play it again,

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.270
but this time, watch the video

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.690
knowing that AI generated
photos and videos

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.550
have trouble accurately doing hands.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.383
I'll play it again.

00:09:33.383 --> 00:09:37.470
And now it feels super obvious
like every time you watch it,

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.410
watch a different set of hands,
it gets weirder and weirder.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.780
You can watch it like five
times and there's dead giveaway

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.950
after dead giveaway,

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.750
not even mentioning the
weird inconsistencies

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.840
with the direction of
the wind on the candles.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.370
But even as I'm saying all that,

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.810
even as it's coming outta my mouth,

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.660
I can't help but remember
that 12 months ago

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.652
we were critiquing this.

00:09:56.652 --> 00:09:58.260
(Will laughing)

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.360
So what does this all mean?

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.700
Well, I mean, there's what it means now

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.010
and there's what it means for the future.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.190
Now, Sora, this thing that they've made

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.600
is clearly a really impressive
video generation AI tool

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.600
that is both going to fool
people and also be very useful.

00:10:18.082 --> 00:10:21.150
There's also a watermark
in the bottom corner

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.560
of every video generated by it.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.790
So if you see one of those videos

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.070
and ideally it hasn't been cropped out,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.900
then that's at least a
pretty clear indicator

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.950
that it's AI generated.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:29.880
It's a Sora video.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.420
But also, I do think they're
gonna have to be very careful

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.610
with this, they're gonna have
a whole bunch of safety stuff

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.443
to keep in mind.

00:10:36.443 --> 00:10:37.920
I think they'll probably
have to be even more safe

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.910
than DALL.E.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.360
Like you shouldn't be able to
generate people's likenesses.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.980
Like you shouldn't be
able to make a politician

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.630
look like they're doing
something on video,

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.610
especially this year.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:48.960
You probably won't be able to make

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.168
Will Smith eating spaghetti,

00:10:50.168 --> 00:10:55.168
but it also definitely
means stock video generation

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:01.050
is absolutely going to take a
dent out of video licensing.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.430
Like I can basically guarantee that.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.250
Like logistically, why would
anyone making something

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.680
pay for footage of a house in the cliffs

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.230
when they can generate one for free

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.940
or for a small subscription price?

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.030
Like that is the real scary
part of what this tool implies.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.890
But in the future, it gets
pretty existential, man.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.100
I mean, okay, if this
is trained on all videos

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.260
that have ever been made by humans,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.990
then surely it can't be
innovative or creative

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.913
in ways that humans haven't
already been, right?

00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:34.740
I don't know.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.969
Either way, I'll have all the links below

00:11:35.969 --> 00:11:38.280
for all the Sora stuff, for OpenAI stuff,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.020
and I guess I'll talk to you next year

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.587
when we look back and go,

00:11:41.587 --> 00:11:44.347
"Remember that first version of Sora

00:11:44.347 --> 00:11:46.177
"and how bad those wolf pups looked

00:11:46.177 --> 00:11:47.927
"when they spawned out of nowhere?"

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.301
Just remember, this is the
worst that this technology

00:11:50.301 --> 00:11:52.863
is going to be from here on out.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.620
Thanks for watching.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.736
Catch you the next one, peace.

00:11:57.736 --> 00:12:00.986
(bright upbeat music)
