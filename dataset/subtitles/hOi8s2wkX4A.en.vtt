00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
(lively music)

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.670
- Is this another Vision Pro video?

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.230
- Uh, yes. Yeah.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.120
Just, it's a good one though. I promise.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.650
- Yeah, mhm. I'm sure.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.483
- No. Okay.

00:00:11.483 --> 00:00:13.710
So I've been thinking a lot about

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.570
what a second-generation
Vision Pro might look like.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.660
- But didn't this literally just came out?

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.760
- No, I know, but okay, so obviously,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.680
there are lots of other VR headsets,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.554
but there are lots of things

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:29.160
that got way more interesting

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.660
about this one joining the market,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.131
and if you compare this to those,

00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:35.160
this is missing stuff.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.340
- Right, but that is also
the most expensive ones.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.290
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.480
There are things that the Quest 3 does

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.200
that if the Vision Pro
did it, it would feel like

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.960
it's a revolutionary change to this thing.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.700
It's a good video, I swear.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.050
- All right. I'll allow it.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.920
- This doesn't work though. You can't.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.760
- Okay. Fine.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.593
- Anyway.

00:00:57.593 --> 00:01:00.210
(upbeat music)
(logo whooshes)

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.160
So I don't think the
Vision Pro is gonna be

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.400
an every single year product
update, like the iPhone.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.330
I think it's gonna be one of those

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.740
that's like every couple of years.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.720
You stack up enough tech
updates every once in a while

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.910
and it's worthy of a new generation

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.710
and then it's a bigger
deal when it comes out,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.543
and by the way,

00:01:14.543 --> 00:01:15.930
that's how a lot of other
VR headsets have been.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.800
The Quest 3 came out like
three years after the Quest 2,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.030
and the PS VR 2 came out like
six years after the first one.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.700
So, in a sense, this is
already very early thoughts,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.170
but it's been out for a little bit

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.430
and we're really starting
to get a sense of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.810
where people are using it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.090
and how people are getting
the most value out of it,

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.640
and let me tell you, a lot
of people are definitely

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.320
still not convinced

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.630
on the whole VR or
Vision Pro thing at all.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.760
Like, it's an interesting
product for sure,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.968
but it just doesn't do much,

00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:46.740
and I started having
those thoughts immediately

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.120
as soon as I started testing this thing,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.390
just all sorts of missing stuff
that I would like it to do.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.120
So this is all those things in one place.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.820
So probably the biggest
thing that you've noticed

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.100
if you've been familiar
with the VR headset world

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.170
or used any other VR headset before

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.820
is the Vision Pro is
missing shared experiences.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.038
Like, you are always so
alone in this headset.

00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:11.730
Like, meaning there are lots of other

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.010
great, super immersive experiences,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.100
and you can be productive
and you can watch a movie,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.560
but no matter what's
happening, you're always alone.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.090
Even if you have pass through on,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.490
nobody else can see what you see,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.710
and so it's basically impossible to share

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.790
what you're experiencing

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.220
without, you know, mirroring
everything on an iPad

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.060
or something like that.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.770
Now, FaceTime is close.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.020
It's one thing, but I'm talking about

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.460
sharing one virtual space
with more than one person

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.590
or seeing the same virtual environment

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.110
at the same time with multiple people

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.200
or seeing the same virtual object

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.200
from two different
perspectives at the same time.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.735
You ever play "Rec Room"?

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:54.480
It's one of the oldest but most
fun games on the Meta Quest.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.620
It's just so simple.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.180
You're just out there having fun,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.310
but it's a bunch of people running around

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.130
a room or an environment
to different game areas

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.600
where they can jump into an experience

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.400
and play a game together.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.350
So, in that digital space,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.070
you look around and see other people,

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.850
and I use people with air
quotes, but you see them,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.430
they see you, and you can
see the same environment

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.290
from different angles at the same time

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.700
and explore it together.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.290
It doesn't even have to be super realistic

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.580
or high resolution

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.590
or convince you that it's another reality,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.230
but it's just way more social

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.310
and interactive and fun that
way, but on Apple Vision Pro,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.460
aside from FaceTime really,
all of the other experiences,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.961
it's just you in there solo.

00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:39.930
Like, there's nobody else in there.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.160
So, no matter what you're doing,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.690
no matter how immersive the movie is

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.769
or no matter how good
the game is around you,

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.770
you're in there by yourself

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.020
and nobody else can
see what you're seeing.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.030
Like, just, here's a basic example.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.860
How sick would it be if you

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.140
and the person next to you on a plane

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.950
could sync up your experiences
and both watch the same movie

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.680
in a virtual theater at the same time?

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.610
Simple as that,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.218
or maybe if you were manipulating
a 3D object in space,

00:04:05.218 --> 00:04:07.980
wouldn't it make a ton of sense

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.201
for someone else to be able
to share that object with you

00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:14.460
so that they can see how
you're manipulating it?

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.170
Like, it feels like it
just makes too much sense.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.820
I told you guys about that Sky Guide app,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.930
which has like, you know,

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.180
you look up and there's all the
stars and the constellations

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.830
and it shows you where
they're all supposed to be.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.940
It is pretty awesome.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.370
Funny enough, there's
a laser pointer feature

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.836
that lets you point a
laser pointer at the sky

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:32.280
and circle around and point
at things and draw things,

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.530
but, still, nobody can see

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.390
what you're pointing at with the laser,

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.160
even if they have a Vision Pro.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.692
So there are two basic
types of shared experiences

00:04:41.692 --> 00:04:45.390
that it would just be great
for Apple to add to this thing.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.328
The first one is two different
people with Vision Pros

00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:52.636
are in the same room with pass through on

00:04:52.636 --> 00:04:55.920
and one of them drops a
virtual object into that room

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.070
and the other can see it at the same time.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.590
Manipulate the object.
They can see it as well.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.490
Great.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.240
The other is two different
people with Vision Pros

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.740
in different places,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.810
halfway across the world, doesn't matter.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.770
They both turn on or join
the same virtual environment

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.632
and can see it at the same time.

00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:20.640
As of right now, I believe
the first one is harder

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.740
because the way these headsets
work with the pass through

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.330
is, basically, in real time,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.880
they are mapping the
volume of space around you

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.980
with the sensors on the front of it,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.170
the surfaces, the walls, the floor,

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.940
the objects around you and everything.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.460
That's how Vision OS is
able to lock your apps

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.960
floating in 3D space

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.450
and how it's casting shadows
onto different surfaces

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.040
in your room with decent accuracy,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.500
but there's no guarantee that,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.790
if you're in a room with someone else

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.050
who also has a headset on,

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.240
that both your headsets
are mapping the room

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.890
in the exact same way.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.930
Like, maybe I place an object into space,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.990
but your headset doesn't see
space there so it's confused,

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.352
or it doesn't map my hands

00:05:57.352 --> 00:06:00.240
or what I'm manipulating
in the exact same way.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.120
It's just not exactly
guaranteed to be the same,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.290
but the other kind,

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.020
just sharing a virtual
environment someone builds

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.580
with anyone anywhere in the
world seems like a no-brainer.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.610
Like, being able to watch a
movie in a virtual movie theater

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.260
with someone else who also gets

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.970
a seat in that movie theater,

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.390
playing an obvious multiplayer
game in the same environment.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.600
Like, this stuff is pretty basic with VR.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.390
I love multiplayer table
tennis in the Quest.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.580
It's one of my favorite
shared VR experiences.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.190
You can play against people
anywhere else in the world.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.810
There's all kinds of
other multiplayer games

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.968
like this in VR.

00:06:34.968 --> 00:06:38.310
That is a huge part of
the VR gaming experience,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.440
and I just wonder why this
doesn't have that yet.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.660
It seems like a huge, huge thing,

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.800
especially, and I know, you know,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.660
Apple has environments
that they've built in

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.460
and they're massive in high resolution,

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.307
but you can only move a little bit

00:06:49.307 --> 00:06:52.350
before you're out of the
play zone, if you will.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.183
It's fascinating.

00:06:53.183 --> 00:06:54.270
I wonder if that's something to do with

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.580
the way Apple thinks
about these environments.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.900
Nevertheless, what I know is

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.120
that's the number one missing
feature on the Vision Pro

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.320
that I'd love to see in a second gen.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.930
Now, the other big one
that stands out to me is,

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.720
if I wanna use Vision
Pro a lot in, let's say,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.720
multiple, just two different
locations, home and work,

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.800
I wish that it had a memory
of all the windows and apps

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.260
that I leave open in each place.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.090
See, Vision Pro is actually already

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.370
amazing at this in one space.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.870
It's seriously incredible.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.020
Windows stay locked to
where you leave them

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.420
as it live maps its way around your space.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.220
So you can pin something to a wall

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.674
and then walk around and pin
something to another wall

00:07:34.674 --> 00:07:37.140
or just in the middle of the room.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.020
Leave the room, come
back, they're still there.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.490
I even tried, ready for this?

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.350
I pinned a window right here

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.840
between these two cars in the parking lot.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.460
Then I turned and walked away,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.555
just left it behind me in the
parking lot, walked inside,

00:07:50.555 --> 00:07:53.430
walked all the way down this long hallway,

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.280
totally out of sight, around
another corner into the studio,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.534
and sure enough,

00:07:58.534 --> 00:08:02.400
that window is still right
there where I left it

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.140
between those spaces in the parking lot.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.240
The only thing holding it
back from being nearly perfect

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.110
is occlusion.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.610
Basically, the only thing

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.610
that ever gets between the window and you

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.820
is your own arms and hands,
which is usually totally fine,

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.740
but if you have something
like around a corner,

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.830
it doesn't put the wall in
between you and the window,

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.700
which is where it should be.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.110
So, sometimes it gets a little wonky,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.840
but overall 9 out of
10, already really cool,

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.730
but the second it gets dinged is

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.920
when you wanna do this
in more than one space.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.490
So let's say, at home, I've set
up all these suite monitors.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.800
I've got a virtual TV
in one room and a game

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.890
and some windows all over
the walls or whatever.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:38.910
Cool.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.280
I pack it up, I drive here to the studio,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.924
and I put it on, and the second
I start opening apps here,

00:08:45.924 --> 00:08:49.059
they have to disappear from home.

00:08:49.059 --> 00:08:51.450
They basically disappear
from any other space

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.980
and open in your new space.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.400
So there is no memory of
different older spaces,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.520
so when I go back home, my
windows are all gonna be gone,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.400
and I'll have to set them
each individually up again.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.310
Not a huge deal, but if it had a memory,

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.230
wouldn't that just make sense?

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.150
I wonder if you could set
up like little beacons.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.470
Like, all it really probably needs is

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.420
like a QR code or some visual identifier,

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.895
but basically, you get home,
you put the headset on,

00:09:14.895 --> 00:09:17.520
it sees the beacon, and then
it goes, "Oh, I'm at home,"

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.350
and then it puts your
windows all the way up

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.840
where it already knows you
usually have them for work,

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.730
and so you basically just
kick back on the couch,

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.190
put the headset on, and
you don't have to re-set up

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.140
each window in all the
same places you want it

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:28.973
every single time.

00:09:28.973 --> 00:09:31.050
It just remembers that.
That would be sick.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.220
Those two features alone

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.080
I think would make a dramatic update

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.040
to how often I realistically
would use Vision Pro.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.570
Just, I don't know if that requires

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:40.950
some Vision OS software update

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.260
or if you need more
compute to do things like

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.320
more memory of locations
or shared computing spaces,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.913
but that's the giant things

00:09:48.913 --> 00:09:51.900
that I think are missing from
it that would be awesome.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.090
Then the rest of the
stuff, on my list anyway,

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.040
is maybe a little more icing on the cake.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.873
Like, here's another one.

00:09:56.873 --> 00:10:00.437
I think probably 99.99% of people

00:10:00.437 --> 00:10:03.616
who buy a Vision Pro have an iPhone.

00:10:03.616 --> 00:10:04.650
I think that's pretty safe.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.483
It might be a hundred,

00:10:05.483 --> 00:10:07.340
but I think that's a
reasonable assumption,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.850
and I found it interesting.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.190
I think a lot of people assume that

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.260
it'll just connect to the iPhone

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.400
and they think that they'll be able to

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.110
see their phone notifications

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.810
straight away on the
Vision Pro, but it's not.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.200
It's a separate device
like a Mac or an iPad.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.472
So, yeah, it'll show you iMessage stuff

00:10:24.472 --> 00:10:27.720
'cause that's everywhere,
but it is a separate device.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.040
But, you know, the obvious difference is,

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.717
unlike a Mac or an iPad,
when you put on a headset,

00:10:32.717 --> 00:10:35.511
well, now, you're wearing a headset,

00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:39.719
so if I were to get a
phone call on my iPhone,

00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:41.586
I couldn't necessarily

00:10:41.586 --> 00:10:43.500
even see that I'm getting a phone call.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.810
There is no notification
for it in the Vision Pro,

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.700
and I'm gonna have to take the headset off

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.250
to even see it coming and
accept that phone call.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.260
So it would be nice to have an option

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.990
where these two things talk
to each other a little better.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.007
Just maybe a little hub

00:10:56.007 --> 00:10:58.770
for just my smartphone's notifications

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.970
over to the side if I wanna check them.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.230
I think it makes sense. They
probably won't do that though.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.730
But here's a number for you.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.900
3,386.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.900
That is the pixel density of
the Vision Pro's displays.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.400
It's kind of a ridiculous number.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.100
Over 3,000 pixels per inch each.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.120
So there's been some tear-downs.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.500
I'll link some below the like buttons.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.800
You can see them up close.
They're incredibly sharp.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.188
So, that and the high refresh
rate and minimal distortion

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.314
all contribute to a pass-through

00:11:31.314 --> 00:11:34.140
and just everything feeling so real,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.279
but the number I'd actually
like to improve is 92.

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:41.310
So the Vision Pros displays show

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.300
92% of the DCI-P3 color gamut.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.133
Pretty good coverage.

00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:48.210
Like, for a display, that's
honestly pretty good.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.730
The reference grade display that is, like,

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.350
the Pro Display XCR, for example,

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.930
that'll show you you 99% of DCI-P3.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.000
So, again, it's, for a
display, a pretty great number,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.470
but the thing about a VR headset is

00:12:00.591 --> 00:12:02.310
it's replacing your eyes.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.760
Like, the pass through is
pretty good for what it is,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.710
but without getting too complicated,

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:12.710
100% coverage of DCI-P3
is about 50% coverage

00:12:13.747 --> 00:12:17.272
of all of the colors that
the human eye can see.

00:12:17.272 --> 00:12:21.000
So this headset looks
great and it's very sharp,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.140
but it's only showing me

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.560
a little less than half
of the colors of reality.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.690
So I wonder how much
they can improve that,

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.150
because the human eye is obviously insane.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.707
It has crazy dynamic range
and foveated rendering

00:12:33.707 --> 00:12:35.550
and great sharpness
and all that fun stuff,

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.560
but, you know, Apple's been really good

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.120
at a lot of displays for a long time

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.220
and these are some incredible displays.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.300
So, field of view, wider
please, but also, yeah,

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.880
just generally more color
would be interesting.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.620
There's lots of other little
things that are obvious,

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.814
like weight reduction please, of course.

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:55.380
Higher quality screen recording

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.910
is a niche little request of mine,

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.230
but I think would help a lot

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.170
for people trying to make
videos with these things.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.939
Also, even more specific,
keyboard pass-through

00:13:05.939 --> 00:13:08.310
while in an environment.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.110
So you're in an
environment, you're typing,

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.700
you've got your virtual Mac display,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.510
and if it can see and recognize
my hands after a scan,

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.120
I think it would be nice
if you could also build in

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.280
a feature to scan your keyboard

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.920
or recognize the keyboard of your MacBook,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.350
just 'cause it's gonna
look the same every time,

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.740
kind of like my hands.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.890
All that being said, I'm
sure there are more things

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.990
that people, you know, are
thinking about on their lists,

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.030
but let me know what you think about

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.000
Apple Vision Pro gen two.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Maybe leave your wishlist
in the comments below.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.500
Thanks for watching.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.956
Catch you guys on the next one. Peace.

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:45.539
(lively music)
