00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:05.038
This is a $100 million mega-mansion
and it's possibly

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:08.541
the most luxurious house
ever built by mankind.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.011
And we're going to be comparing
living in this house

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:14.214
to living in this $69
million art house

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.384
that's built to withstand
a literal tsunami,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.540
a $30 million palace
with its very own waterpark

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.158
and everything in between,
all the way down

00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:28.676
to this $1 barely functioning house.

00:00:28.854 --> 00:00:29.739
More of a shed.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:30.764
Well, it's only a dollar.

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.365
Why does this house cost a dollar?

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.986
Yeah, we get another storm, it's
probably going to go into the water.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.470
So it's worth a dollar for me
just to get rid of it.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:40.140
So you would say
this is a horrible investment for me?

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.837
- Yes, indeed.
- Let's do it.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.477
Let's go.

00:00:45.182 --> 00:00:46.413
This is sketchy.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.065
What are the odds I fall through?

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.072
Pretty high.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.017
Bro, these are wobbly.

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:54.020
I like how that chair is just
like holding on for dear life.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.390
We have a recliner, a mattress
and half a floor.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:59.893
I can literally fish
from inside of the house.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.385
Yo, I caught one.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:03.930
That's just the lure. I'm sorry.

00:01:04.112 --> 00:01:06.099
Now that you see us having fun,
do you regret selling it?

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.200
I do not.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.602
What if I gave you $2 to buy
back off me?

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.008
- No.
- Alright, I tried.

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:11.805
I have an idea.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.206
Let's get out of this house.

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.140
Later in this video,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.343
we have a house that cost
100 million times more than this.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:20.880
And because I never plan on setting
foot in this worthless shack again...

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.350
Let's head
over to something a little nicer.

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:27.654
Speaking of which, we're
at the million dollar house,

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:30.757
which technically means you need to be
a millionaire to buy this house.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.659
Let's show you
how a millionaire lives.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.628
My first impression
is it's way bigger than my house.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:38.698
When you pay $1,000,000,
you get a pretty good sized kitchen,

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.267
along with four bedrooms
that look normal.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.535
But they keep going

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:45.572
because this bedroom has a closet
here which leads into a bathroom

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.524
that's bigger than the $1 house.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.415
The bathtub is gigantic.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.612
I'm six foot five and I can fit
in this perfectly comfortable.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.248
And even though the bathrooms
are all stocked with bidets

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:56.796
Oh God!

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.185
The best seat in
the house is definitely downstairs.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.020
Oh snap! They have a movie theater.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.123
Dude, these chairs are massage
chairs.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.257
Wait, what?

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.367
These chairs each
have two remotes.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.045
Two remotes!

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.354
On top of the movie theater,
there's also an arcade.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.932
I was not expecting
all these features for $1 million.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.134
This house is awesome.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.235
I'd have so much more friends.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.336
If I owned a place like this

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.805
and ending with the pool,
which comes complete

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.707
with this unnecessary waterfall.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:23.176
Overall, I'd say this is a
pretty fun house to live in.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:26.012
But of course we're all here
to see the richest of the rich.

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:30.658
And that's why up next,
we have these $15 million...

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:33.753
$15 million house.

00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:34.621
Wait, you pushed it?

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.122
Oh, my God.

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.637
Jeez, man...

00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:39.526
I don't belong here.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:42.395
This looks like the house
that you tried to get to in GTA.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.831
That view is crazy.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.567
The pool is much smaller
than the $1 million house,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.203
but you can literally oversee
all of L.A.

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:51.952
Help!

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.257
Hey! Help!

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.150
Stop. Stop.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.041
Go inside.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.109
I need new friends.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.711
Let's check out the house.
The person who owns this house.

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.947
What do you think
he does for a living?

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:01.955
NFTs

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:02.682
He's a lawyer.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:07.187
This guy was the top attorney in 2017
and the number one lawyer in 2021.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.255
Apparently, that's all
it takes to afford this house.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.591
It appears a note was left for us.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.494
Dear MrBeast, thank
you for visiting my home.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.538
You have given me the ultimate gift.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:19.098
I have a trump card with my kids
forever.

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.234
Also, please don't eat
any of the sandwiches.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:22.368
They are very sacred to me

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:25.471
and my family's been passing it down
from generation to generation.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.240
Got it.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.237
- Down or up?
- Down.

00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:29.222
Down it is.

00:03:29.247 --> 00:03:31.010
Okay, now it's starting to look nice.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.419
The lower floor of this mansion

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:35.215
comes with its very own movie
theater and personal gym.

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.684
This treadmill requires a passcode
to use.

00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:39.099
Six, nine, six, nine.

00:03:39.282 --> 00:03:40.687
It's not six, nine, six, nine.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:44.490
A guest bedroom, an entertainment
area and a bar where the owner left us

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.592
a bunch of free food.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.560
- Guys, before you eat anything.
- Yeah.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.693
What if he left this out 
so he could sue us for eating his...

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:52.183
Well, too late now, Karl ate it.

00:03:52.208 --> 00:03:55.201
And an incredible underground
view of the swimming pool.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.503
Yeah.

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:02.342
Nolan's trying to swim
in the background for the shot.

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.403
I don't think he realized
we stopped filming him.

00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:05.253
Back again?

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:06.613
Yeah, do it one more time.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:10.877
And now a master bedroom
with another crazy view.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.970
Karl, come here.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.354
You missed.

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:15.388
We got another one.

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.489
You missed again.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.991
Oh wait! Nolan, stop it!

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.955
Nolan, stop this cushion also.

00:04:20.603 --> 00:04:22.362
Stop throwing cushions.

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.163
If it goes over the edge he might sue me.

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:28.015
And so to avoid being handed court
papers, we decided to fly all the way

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.447
across the country to Massachusetts
for the $30 million dollar house.

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:38.278
This extraordinary 16 bedroom
estate has four different buildings.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:40.713
In the main house.

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:43.816
There are multiple living rooms,
but this one is the best

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.752
of the living rooms in this property.

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.086
This is grand.

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:49.088
- What is this?
- The Oval Office.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.490
What book would you expect here

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:53.270
besides &lt;i&gt;The Way To Wealth&lt;/i&gt; by Benjamin
Franklin

00:04:53.403 --> 00:04:54.994
Bro made the light bulb and a book?

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:57.121
Well, Edison made the light bulb.
Not Ben Franklin.

00:04:57.155 --> 00:04:58.581
What the hell did
Ben Franklin do?

00:04:58.614 --> 00:05:00.004
I'm going to read this book.

00:05:01.082 --> 00:05:02.402
Past the living room in the office

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:05.675
was the Grand Kitchen where
the owner had left a little gift for us.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.840
The owner of this place.
got rich making candles.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.110
So he made us
custom MrBeast candles.

00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:11.271
That one smells like the beach.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:11.944
It does.

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:13.413
How do they put the beach in a candle?

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:15.348
And to top off the house's
main building,

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.724
Chandler discovered that...

00:05:16.748 --> 00:05:18.306
You can hit golf
balls off the roof.

00:05:19.814 --> 00:05:20.743
Fore!

00:05:20.768 --> 00:05:23.328
That's not even close to
the coolest thing about this place,

00:05:23.353 --> 00:05:26.826
because next door
is a garage filled with exotic cars.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.095
This looks like a garage
out of a video game.

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:31.864
They got Lamborghinis
on top of Lamborghinis.

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:33.966
It's like a candy store for adults.

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:36.703
The best part is
this is just one of two car garages.

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:37.798
- Follow me.
- There's more?

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:39.839
Bro, there's more cars in here
than the other one.

00:05:40.032 --> 00:05:41.441
Holy crap!

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:44.477
All right, now I am convinced if
we steal a car, he would not notice.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:47.013
How do you even buy these cars?
Hey, I want three of the same ones.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.415
It's like a full time job
to buy this many cars.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.736
There's stairs in the corner.
Let's see where they go.

00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:54.054
Bro, this is like a
closet with cars.

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:57.223
Underneath the car garage
is another army of cars.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.292
They should really invest in a light
switch down here.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.294
They have 20 cars down here,
but no lights.

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:04.806
- Did I...?
- No way!

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:05.798
No.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.751
No way!

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.005
That's
why there wasn't a light switch.

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:15.007
I was like,
who can afford to shove 30 cars

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:16.809
in their basement
but not electricity?

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.478
Now, don't get me wrong,
all of the rooms

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.380
in this house
have been awesome so far.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.783
But if I owned it, I don't think
I'd ever leave this next building.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.651
This is awesome.

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:26.252
That's right.

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:29.722
For some just ungodly reason,
whoever built this place thought

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:33.359
it would be a good idea to install an
entire indoor tennis court.

00:06:33.784 --> 00:06:37.281
I just want to remind you that
we are playing tennis inside a house.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:41.401
I also have no idea how to play
tennis.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.837
Gang squad, follow me.

00:06:42.947 --> 00:06:44.880
What?
No way!

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.038
Two story arcade.

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:47.106
The arcade in this house

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:50.643
is actually 20 times bigger
than the one at the $1 million house.

00:06:50.668 --> 00:06:51.536
But that's not all.

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:54.914
Bro, this place literally has everything.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.215
All right, I'm never leaving.

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:59.696
We're playing ping pong
in a basketball court, in a house.

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:02.588
First try, baby!

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:06.092
Now, all of the features of the $30
million house have been pretty cool.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:09.328
But this next room is
what makes this place truly special.

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:12.198
Head up these stairs
for the best part of the estate.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:16.353
What you really want to see is
right over here, look at this.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.931
This is an indoor waterpark.

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:22.074
It's like a whole new world in here.

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:25.244
Look how far back the drone is
and it's still going.

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:27.580
Go have fun,
but don't break anything.

00:07:27.806 --> 00:07:28.813
Roger that.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.538
We're all about to go down
the slide together.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.563
We're going to enjoy the waterpark.

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:44.931
I'll see you at the next house.

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:48.734
The only bad news is it's once again
across the entire country.

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:53.080
The good news is it's a $45
million mega-mansion.

00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:55.808
- What!
- Oh, my gosh.

00:07:55.833 --> 00:07:57.692
This is like the most open house
I've ever been in.

00:07:57.731 --> 00:07:58.320
What?

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:01.581
I don't know what majestic thing
this is, but it's beautiful.

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:02.849
As you can probably tell,

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.917
these houses
are starting to get so expensive,

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.746
I don't even know how
to describe them anymore.

00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:08.354
Honestly, lost for words.

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:11.290
This is quite possibly the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.635
So I called in multi-billionaire
Mark Cuban to help us out.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.870
- How's it going?
- Hey!

00:08:16.285 --> 00:08:17.456
- How's it going, little man?
- Nice to meet you.

00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:20.666
Mark's also the proud owner of
the Dallas Mavericks basketball team.

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.436
And because this house
has its very own basketball court,

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:25.538
you can imagine
we got a little distracted.

00:08:26.028 --> 00:08:27.395
- Jimmy won't make it!
- Buckets!

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:29.876
Just steal it from Karl.

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:30.376
Hit that.

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:31.989
- No shot.
- We get those.

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:33.012
Yeah, that's it.

00:08:33.037 --> 00:08:34.841
Go, go, go, go, go.
Easy lay bud

00:08:34.996 --> 00:08:36.057
Yeah.

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:38.851
There we go. Jake's play wins.
All you. Hit it. Game winner.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:39.427
Oh, no.

00:08:39.458 --> 00:08:40.487
Yeah!

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.818
Way to dominate, Jakers.

00:08:41.843 --> 00:08:43.456
Now, we're going to show Mark
around the rest of the house,

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.563
Now that we're all sweating.

00:08:44.588 --> 00:08:48.661
To find out if he thought it was worth
the steep $45 million price.

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:50.663
In case you're wondering,
we didn't go swimming.

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:52.465
It looks like I did go swimming.

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:54.732
- How much do they want for this house?
- 45.

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:57.436
- Not worth it?
- Because it's Brentwood.

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:58.771
That's probably half of it.

00:08:58.771 --> 00:08:59.959
Is Brentwood what that is?

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.008
No, the neighborhood.

00:09:02.659 --> 00:09:04.912
I also thought he was talking
about the wood in the house.

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:06.212
That's funny.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.847
This bathroom over here, it's nice.

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:09.815
Do you have a couch in your bathroom?

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.384
- Yes.
- Oh really?

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:11.918
Yeah.

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.066
Okay. We need to get on Mark's level.

00:09:13.091 --> 00:09:16.170
The number one rule is, you have to
have a heated seat.

00:09:16.195 --> 00:09:16.565
That's it?

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:19.058
- That feeling when you sit down...
- And it is not cold?

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:20.359
I agree.

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:22.061
You don't need to make billions
to be happy.

00:09:22.093 --> 00:09:24.996
You just need to be able to afford
a bidet and a heated toilet seat.

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:26.866
Cause that's where I spend
most of my time.

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:29.101
Well, even though I'm sure Mark
would love to spend more time

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:32.004
here on the toilets,
our time here is officially ran out.

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:34.507
And so I'll see you guys
at the next house.

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:37.276
Up next, we have a house
whose price point happens

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:38.744
to be my favorite number.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:42.248
And now we are at the $69 million
mansion.

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:44.201
That looks like a villain owns it.

00:09:44.232 --> 00:09:45.618
It does look villainous.

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:47.520
How's this compare to your house, Miranda?

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.388
It's a lot bigger than mine.

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:51.657
That can't be sure.
What's your address?

00:09:52.084 --> 00:09:54.694
The reason why this weird looking
house can still go on the market

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:57.897
for $69 million
is because it's filled to the brim

00:09:57.897 --> 00:10:01.667
with priceless art and sculptures
sourced from all around the world.

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:03.669
Throw up
how much these artworks are worth

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:06.105
and we're going to try to guess it.
How much do you think this is worth?

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:09.208
I'm going to say 100,000.

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:10.876
- What do you think, Miranda?
- I'm going to go with 80.

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:12.478
Oh, she has one of these in her house.

00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:13.846
Yeah. I have the same one.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.414
Only you know the actual price.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.283
Oh, actually,
this one will be a fun one.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.752
I'm going to go with $1,000,000
because it's like right down

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:21.137
the opening stairs, so...

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.310
$450,000

00:10:22.342 --> 00:10:24.224
- Very precise.
- Very specific.

00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:25.458
The $30 million house

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:27.693
had a waterpark, a hundred cars.

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:30.123
This place just has artwork.

00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:31.440
Big red sculpture.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.233
This room over here,
we promised them 30 times

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:35.310
we wouldn't touch what's in it.

00:10:35.342 --> 00:10:35.877
Come over here.

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:38.304
No touching anything, what is it?

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:42.808
This is a one of one
fully analog custom home sound system

00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:46.445
made by the creator of the Walkman,
which was one of the first devices

00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:48.447
that allowed you to listen to music
while walking.

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:50.349
That's an impressive thing
to have under your belt.

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:51.984
To have made the Walkman.

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.560
I don't think you could fit this
under your belt.

00:10:55.826 --> 00:10:57.089
Let's traverse across the skywalk.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.057
Oh, my God. I'm excited.

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.660
Another reason
this house is built so strange.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.030
For example, having to walk across
SkyBridge is to get anywhere

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.032
is because it's
been meticulously built

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:09.301
to be able to withstand
the force of a real tsunami.

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:11.568
I mean, you got to admit,
that's pretty cool.

00:11:11.929 --> 00:11:14.787
You can see the tsunamis before
they hit your house and you stop them.

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:18.611
What completes
the view is the neighbor's backyard.

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:19.845
You can see all of it.

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.056
What if the man who lives here
is secretly in love

00:11:22.088 --> 00:11:23.732
with the person that lives next door?

00:11:23.757 --> 00:11:25.124
That's his ex girlfriend.

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:26.360
It's a Romeo and Juliet.

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:28.854
And after checking out
the last two rooms inside,

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:30.790
I had a surprise
waiting for us outside.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.564
Look over there.

00:11:32.013 --> 00:11:32.654
What?

00:11:32.678 --> 00:11:34.169
Deez nuts.

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:35.828
Did you guys even notice
the planes drawing that?

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:36.962
No.

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:38.356
How on earth did they do that?

00:11:38.381 --> 00:11:41.000
I paid these planes
and also about a thousand billboards

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.668
all across America
to let everyone know

00:11:42.693 --> 00:11:45.162
that Feastables is the best
tasting chocolate you can buy.

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:48.841
Stop eating Hershey's and other boomer
brand's, Feastables is modern chocolate.

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:51.077
Also, because halloween is coming up
in all these retailers

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:52.078
you see here, we're now

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:54.413
selling these bags
of these smaller pieces bars

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:56.082
so you can give them out during trick
or treating.

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:57.750
If you don't want to be lame
on Halloween,

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.752
make sure you give away
Feastables to trick-or-treaters.

00:11:59.922 --> 00:12:01.887
Luckily,
our candy is pretty affordable,

00:12:01.996 --> 00:12:03.698
but you know what's not so affordable?

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.484
The final house,
or should I say

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:10.409
the $139 million

00:12:10.433 --> 00:12:13.966
arguably most luxurious house on the
planet Mega-Mansion

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:16.502
This massive

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:21.307
36,000 square foot mansion has things
you never see in any other house,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.412
from a nightclub to a T-Rex
to an entire robotic car elevator.

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:30.322
This place is going to blow your mind
and to make this house tour

00:12:30.347 --> 00:12:32.585
extra special,
we brought Justin Timberlake.

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:33.586
How you guys doing?

00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:36.580
And this is Justin's house
and he's going to show us around.

00:12:36.828 --> 00:12:37.609
No.

00:12:38.016 --> 00:12:39.067
Holy crap!

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:41.060
Have you ever seen a view
better than this in your life?

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.796
- This is gorgeous.
- Yeah, man, you guys really...

00:12:43.821 --> 00:12:46.071
The CGI is perfect, it looks real.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.034
He's like, "Yeah, maybe it's top 10."

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:50.402
I'll put it top five.

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:54.039
It's hard to describe
just how big this mansion really is.

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:58.878
It has 12 bedrooms and 17 bathrooms
split across three massive

00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:02.348
stories, all with a perfect view
of the Los Angeles skyline.

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:05.751
I always judge a house
by the kitchen, minimalist kitchen.

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:07.578
You judge these things.
How are you feeling?

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.121
Well, let's keep going.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:11.357
At the end of the tour,
we'll get his opinion on

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:12.858
if he would pay $100 million.

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:15.027
He has it on standby if he likes it.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.362
Straight cash, homie.

00:13:16.362 --> 00:13:20.032
Everything in this house is built
out of the most expensive materials

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:20.633
on the planet.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:24.570
For example, the walls in this room
are constructed entirely out of rare

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.672
marble, imported straight from Italy.

00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:28.607
You guys got to get an estimate
or something

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:31.010
on how much marble
is actually in this house.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.337
I mean, that's a
that's like custom done.

00:13:33.416 --> 00:13:35.915
Yeah, there's not a single thing
of drywall in this entire house.

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.079
Drywall?

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.093
This is a pretty sick chandelier.

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:41.387
This chandelier is over $1,000,000.

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:43.556
And the ceiling
literally started dipping

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.324
because it weighs
so many thousands of pounds.

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:46.559
It really keeps going.

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.994
You didn't tell me it was a million.
I was playing with it earlier.

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:53.666
There is literally $6 million
of just chandeliers in this house

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:56.164
and the rooms on the bottom floor
get even better.

00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:57.899
There's a whole other house
down here.

00:13:57.924 --> 00:13:59.213
If you come over here...

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:00.940
Dude, this is literally an ice room.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.842
- This is where you lock me in?
- No.

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:03.793
Please don't.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.524
So, what do you do in here?

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:11.250
They ran out of room ideas.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.819
Probably a 50%
chance we're locked in here

00:14:13.844 --> 00:14:14.995
because that doesn't have a handle.

00:14:15.002 --> 00:14:15.805
Oh, no. We're good.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.142
That would have been funny if we were

00:14:17.173 --> 00:14:18.235
His face.

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:22.094
Is that a real dinosaur?

00:14:22.094 --> 00:14:25.673
Now that you know the house has a
dinosaur, are you more apt to buy it?

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:27.719
I'm still on the fence.

00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:30.015
What?

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.079
Is this a locker room?

00:14:31.118 --> 00:14:32.972
No one currently owns this house,

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:35.040
so they put nametags
of the few people

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.914
on the planet
that can actually afford it.

00:14:36.946 --> 00:14:40.079
Warren Buffett's worth like 80 billion,
Ellison's worth, like 50 billion.

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.513
Bezos Like 100 billion.

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:43.382
Chandler, why is your name not up here?

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:46.919
All right, let's check out the whips.

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:49.588
- Nolan, are you just posing?
- I'll just be sitting here.

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:51.323
You really match the house.

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:51.790
Thank you.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.539
I was going for that, I was going for that.

00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:54.402
Job well done.

00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:56.711
Nolan's going to go in the editing room
and clip that.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.671
This $2.5 million car elevator

00:15:00.696 --> 00:15:03.636
is one of the most insane
features in the whole house.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:06.372
You select which car
you want to drive on the tablet,

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:09.842
and it literally sends it up
two floors right into the garage.

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:10.743
I know what you're thinking.

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.678
The main problem with
this is it only stores

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:14.321
- Six Lamborghinis and...
- Yeah...

00:15:14.454 --> 00:15:16.454
You needed like a ten car storage.

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:17.182
Right.

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:19.218
This house also had the by far

00:15:19.243 --> 00:15:22.424
biggest home theater
I've ever seen in my life.

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:24.323
This almost looks
like a real movie theater.

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:26.759
This is the best movie
theater so far.

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:28.694
And they're actually reclining
chairs.

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:30.641
It only costs
100 mil for that.

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:32.852
Check it out, Jimmy.
Wait, press my massage button.

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:33.633
I got you.

00:15:38.454 --> 00:15:40.118
Hey! I don't need this

00:15:42.211 --> 00:15:44.616
Bro, where's my button?
My chair's not even doing that.

00:15:44.649 --> 00:15:45.511
Here, switch. Let me see.

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:47.555
Yeah, Chandler test the massage feature.

00:15:49.352 --> 00:15:51.383
Oh, my god, it works.

00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:53.752
No way this is just the only one here.

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:55.629
Man. This is great.

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:57.185
Bro, what is wrong with them?

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.892
All right, lead the way upstairs.

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:02.185
This is a primary bedroom over here.

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:05.130
Oh, and then over here.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:05.864
The bathrooms.

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:07.866
In case you've ever
wanted to shower with ten people.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.268
Now you can.

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:10.569
That's my thing, man.

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:12.271
You can take a bath with no one.

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:14.540
And basically all yourself
but showering.

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.041
You can fit an army in there.

00:16:16.066 --> 00:16:18.185
- If that's what you're into.
- He is.

00:16:19.453 --> 00:16:21.555
And now the best part of the house
over at the pool.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.787
The real reason this house cost
so much.

00:16:23.812 --> 00:16:24.596
I'm pressing it.

00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:27.771
Is this a screen?

00:16:27.811 --> 00:16:30.388
It is absurdly large.

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:35.327
And slow.

00:16:35.352 --> 00:16:37.445
- It gives drama, though.
- It is. Exactly.

00:16:37.522 --> 00:16:39.553
It gives a dramatic effect.

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:47.439
I mean...

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:49.441
It's a little bit of a flex.

00:16:49.441 --> 00:16:51.131
What a gorgeous view of L.A.

00:16:51.917 --> 00:16:53.919
Yeah. Imagine
this screensaver was L.A.

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.180
I think it is.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.815
There's downtown L.A.

00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:58.617
and there's downtown L.A.

00:16:58.617 --> 00:17:00.819
For reference, Karl is
like six foot five.

00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:02.083
Yeah, something like that.
Give or take

00:17:02.108 --> 00:17:04.289
And look
how tall the TV is compared to him.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.092
All right, Justin,
you've seen the whole house.

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.127
We need to know.

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:11.536
Obviously, you have $100 million
in cash sitting outside.

00:17:11.677 --> 00:17:12.240
Right.

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:13.465
Are you going to buy the house?

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:15.300
- Nolan's shirt comes with it.
- You don't like my shirt?

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.735
- Your shirt comes with it?
- Yeah.

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:20.176
I'm in. Does the bear that
ripped up the shirt come with it?

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:25.611
Oh, no!

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:26.245
Let's go!

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.676
- Wait, wait.
- Why?

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:29.281
I hope you guys enjoyed it

00:17:29.306 --> 00:17:30.312
I'll see you around.
