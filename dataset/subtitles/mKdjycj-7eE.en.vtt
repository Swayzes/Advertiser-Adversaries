00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.801
- Sitting on these train tracks

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.870
is a quarter million dollar Lamborghini.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.372
And barreling down at it

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.474
right now is a massive train.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.410
But before the impact, I'm
giving this Lamborghini to Blake.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.244
- Thank you.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:12.379
- And on top of sending the train,

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.647
I'm also gonna have these eight soldiers

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:17.384
shoot 10,000 bullets at your Lamborghini.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:18.818
- That's the scariest
thing I've ever seen.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.053
- Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:23.256
- And you have exactly 24 hours
to build whatever you want

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.325
to protect your Lambo from the bullets.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:26.426
The timer starts now.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.927
- Okay, first line of defense,

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.530
I'm thinking a wall of
cinder blocks, after that

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.632
some shipping containers
filled with refrigerators

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:34.868
and then basically just a wall of cars

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.302
to block those bullets.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.737
- Do you think
all of this is enough

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:39.305
to stop 10,000 bullets?

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.507
- I think it is, Jimmy.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.409
- Okay, but so
far nothing's there.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.243
You should get to building.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.844
- So Blake immediately
drove to three stores

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.613
where I gave him my credit card

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:49.549
and he literally spent
$78,000 on supplies.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.018
And since I don't wanna bore
you with all that, let's skip

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:53.553
to the part where
everything was delivered.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.722
This first round of supplies
are starting to show up.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.624
- Oh my God, I can't believe
I bought all this stuff.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:58.925
And this isn't even everything, man.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.093
- He's got a water truck.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.795
Some of his junk cars came in.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.696
He's got a CONEX crate over here.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.432
How did he get this much
stuff? This is crazy.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.101
Don't worry about the guys
with the machine guns.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.302
Just pretend they're not there.

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:11.037
Yeah, I don't even know what

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.072
they're doing there, honestly.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.174
- We're five hours in and
this storage container

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.675
is about to be the first line of defense

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:16.743
against 10,000 bullets.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.446
- Alright, that's probably
good. That's probably good.

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.714
Do you think that shipping container's

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:22.549
gonna stop any bullets?

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.383
- Absolutely not.

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:26.119
- So as of now, he's screwed.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.387
- Yeah, it's not looking good for him.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.221
- Oh gosh.

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.423
It's been about six hours. Are
you happy with your progress?

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.558
- I'm very happy.
- You sure?

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.493
- It wasn't until this thing got down,

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.228
but now that it's down,
dude, I feel really good.

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.263
- I asked him if this
would stop the bullets

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:38.798
and they said no.

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:41.568
And once Blake realized
he had to go all out,

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:43.336
he works not only through the night

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:45.105
This way, Mr. Railroad ties.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.773
- Nice, nice. Yes.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.007
- Really nice. Really nice.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.776
- But even into the next morning,

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.111
upgrading his defense-

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.346
- Dude, he's stuffing the
storage container with a van

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:54.380
and a giant tube!

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.982
- And once I saw it put together,

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:57.650
I was honestly pretty impressed.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.985
Run me through what you built.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.854
- So I built a whole
bunch of concrete in the front

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:02.856
and the tallest part of the
wall is right in the center

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.491
to block the crow's nest machine guns

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:05.892
'cause those things are big and scary.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.560
- I got all my cars in storage containers

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.495
and a bunch of water.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.363
- And if you come right over here,

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.700
you'll see his Lamborghini
tucked away amongst everything.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.301
- There it is. Nice and cozy.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.904
- Do you think all of
this will stop the bullets?

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.339
- Yeah, I do.

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.674
I think you have a 50% chance of survival.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.176
- That's the best odds I've had yet.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.245
- And before I have
them shoot 10,000 rounds,

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:26.846
come with me to the Lamborghini.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.548
Not only are you competing
for this Lamborghini,

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:30.316
but for a hundred grand as well.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.851
- What?
- Yes sir.

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.286
- Yeah, that's pretty cool, huh?

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.822
- This will be enough to cover
the insurance.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.457
24 hours is up!

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:40.727
Eight scary men, 10,000 bullets-

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:42.662
- Versus everything
that Blake has built...

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:43.530
- Are you ready?

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.199
- Just get it over with. I'm freaking out.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.768
- We're locked and loaded.
Ready to fire on you, Jimmy.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:52.005
- Sir, fire at will.
- Roger that.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.039
- Standby!

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:54.174
Fire!

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.277
- Oh!
- Oh my god!

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.347
- They are unloading on his fortress.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.716
- Oh my God! This is crazy!

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.252
- They're actually ripping through

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.253
the cinder blocks now.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.091
- Oh man. Oh god.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:15.061
- Oh, Blake's walls
are crumbling right now!

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.700
And what we haven't told
Blake is these guns are only

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.236
the first of four phases we've designed

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:24.704
to destroy this Lamborghini,

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.740
or should I say whatever
remains after this?

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:30.710
- They just brought up the LMG.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.584
- Oh, whoa!

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:41.354
- Oh, it's melting!

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:43.957
- No!

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.427
Cinder blocks are falling!

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:48.261
- Ah!

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:50.697
- All it takes is
one bullet to penetrate

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:52.265
and it's going in his Lambo.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.101
- Oh my God!

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.174
- These are the last bullets.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.278
- Ten thousand!

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:07.680
- All clear? Let's go.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.549
Please be safe. Please be safe.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.418
How is it?!

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.820
- She's clean, baby!

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:18.992
- Whoo! 10,000 rounds and
not one connection baby.

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.294
- There's no bullet holes
in your Lamborghini.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.329
And if you don't already
know who Blake is,

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:25.632
he's actually a contestant
from our previous two videos.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:27.600
But today he's back for a third

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.336
and final attempt to win the grand prize.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.304
- Are you ready for phase two?

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.138
- Yes.

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:33.740
- See that giant crane coming?

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.675
- That big yellow oil rig looking thing?

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:37.043
- That is phase two.

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:39.646
That crane is going to lift
your car up a hundred feet

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.414
and then in 24 hours drop it.

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:44.117
And you have to catch it
without it being destroyed.

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:45.918
- Seriously?

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.920
- Yeah. Alright, bring it over here!

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.423
And while we prepared the
world's first 100 foot

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.557
Lamborghini free fall...

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:53.226
- There goes your Lamborghini, Blake!

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:56.195
Blake began to strategize on
how he was going to catch it.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:57.163
- I have no idea what I'm gonna do.

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:58.064
- Chandler, come over here.

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:58.898
- Yes, I'm here.

00:04:58.898 --> 00:04:59.866
- How would you break its fall?

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.501
- So you get all the pillows in the city.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:04.604
Step two, get all the
mattresses, next, get a blanket.

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:06.272
- Chandler, you're just
making a giant bed.

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:07.573
- Then a warm glass of milk...

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:08.841
- All right, stop. You're not helping.

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.176
Blake, work your magic.

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:11.110
- I'm screwed.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.279
- Alright guys, I got some
good news and bad news.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.847
We passed day one with flying colors.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:17.283
The bad news is the
Lamborghini is airborne.

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.652
Okay? So anyone got any ideas?

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.055
I mean, yeah, hit me,
like what do we think?

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.023
- The bouncy castles.
- Bouncy castles.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.425
That that's actually not that bad.

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:28.227
Just because...that's
not bad at all really.

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:29.429
- And after being inspired

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.064
by the construction worker's wisdom,

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:33.066
Blake had decided on his master plan.

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.802
- I would like to move the
CONEXes in like a square,

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.437
right here with the X in the middle.

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:39.439
And that way I can just fill
the square up with a bunch

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.941
of air mattresses, pillows, bubble wrap,

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:44.043
and on top it all off with
a bunch of bouncy castles.

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:47.046
Just the biggest problem right
now is I have no material.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:50.450
Everything that I bought
is hard, concrete or metal.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.819
And nothing that I bought
I can use for day two.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:54.153
So, I have absolutely nothing.

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:56.389
- And so Blake sent his
crew to buy every pillow

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.623
and air mattress in the city.

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.826
And even though he was
incredibly sleep deprived,

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:00.660
he got to work.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.595
- I'm already at the stage
where it's like, "Wait,

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:03.896
why am I doing this again?"

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.199
Oh yeah, that's right. I'm in
a challenge for a Lamborghini

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.734
that's floating in the sky right now.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:09.602
- By the time his
materials had arrived,

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.804
Blake had been awake for over 24 hours

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.606
and was in desperate need of sleep.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:14.574
- I'm gonna try to get some sleep

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.709
'cause I'm exhausted and
it's four in the morning.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.444
- And with how exhausted Blake was,

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:21.147
he ended up sleeping for
way longer than he planned.

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:23.583
Blake!

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.184
Is he serious?

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:26.119
- What is this?

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.321
He got mattresses, pillows, and blankets.

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:30.022
But he's missing the warm milk.

00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:31.624
- Yeah, that's the key to everything.

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:32.725
- Where is Blake?

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:33.993
- He's asleep. I heard.

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.027
- No, he is not.

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:36.629
- By the time Blake got on site,

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.664
it was already super late in the day.

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:39.832
- That's Blake's truck pulling up.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:41.968
Alright, we need to get to work. Come on!

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.503
- Alright, let's just
see what this looks like.

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:46.539
Oh, that bouncy house works as a big box.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.208
So I'm thinking maybe we put
that thing in the middle now

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.877
and then we start blowing it up.

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:52.779
- Only four and a half hours remain

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.213
and it's not looking good for Blake.

00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:56.282
I don't think he has
more than a 10% chance

00:06:56.282 --> 00:06:57.350
of catching a Lamborghini.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.385
- And even if he does,
there's no shot he's stopping

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:00.319
that train later on.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.289
- Start filling up the side so
that way it's high over here,

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:04.757
takes away this wall.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:06.826
- So with only a
couple of hours remaining,

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:09.629
Blake did all that he could
by filling the rest of his pit

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:11.464
with cardboard boxes and bubble wrap.

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:12.932
- It's coming down to the wire.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.168
Chandler, how much time is left?

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:16.736
- One hour.

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:17.470
- Blake is screwed.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.704
- I have a little bit of bubble wrap left.

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.339
I think I'm just gonna
get raised on this thing

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.108
and just wrap my baby
up in this bubble wrap

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:22.942
and I'm good to go.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.210
- That's definitely gonna help.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.212
- Blake spent what little
time he had remaining

00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:28.881
on this crane, failing at
trying to bubble wrap his car.

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.416
- It's just not gonna work.

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:31.651
- You know what time it is?

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:32.485
- What?

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:35.154
- Time to drop the car.
Let's drop this by boy.

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:39.258
The failed bubble wrap
makes it look majestic.

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:41.727
Blake, do you think your
Lamborghini will survive?

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:42.762
- I'm positive, Jimmy.

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.330
- He is more certain than me.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.231
- I'm positive about this one.

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:47.033
I bought every air mattress at Walmart.

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.801
If this won't catch it,
I don't know what will.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.036
I did everything I can.

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:51.871
- Here's a Feastables bar, Blake.

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:52.839
- Ah, thank you Mr.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:53.673
- That way even if you lose the car,

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:55.541
at least you have some good chocolate.

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:57.777
It's available at Walmart. Be
sure to go try our new bar.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:59.011
I'm so curious what you think.

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:03.483
But anyway, you have three
bouncy castles, 150 mattresses,

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:04.450
how many pillows?
- 150.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.654
- 150 pillows and 2,000 cardboard boxes!

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:10.823
Will it break the Lamborghini's fall?

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:12.325
- Yes. Yes.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.559
- That's two yeses.
- Okay.

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:17.430
- 24 hours of work, down
to this, no pun intended.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.968
- 3, 2, 1. Drop the Lamborghini!

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:35.882
Here we go! Outta my way!

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.016
- That did not sound good.

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:39.085
- Please be okay.
Please be okay. Please be okay.

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:39.919
Please be okay.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.320
- Alright. He's moving the
CONEX crate out the way.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.456
- There's no way you caught that Lambo.

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.624
- Get these boxes outta the way!

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:46.225
- Whoa!
- What?

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:48.294
- We're about to find out
how damaged this car is.

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:49.128
- The lights work.

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:50.663
- Ooh, the lights work.

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:52.198
- Yeah. This princess castle might have

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.766
saved this entire car.

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:54.834
- Moment of truth.

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:56.936
You might've been the
first person in history

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:58.371
to catch a Lamborghini-

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.672
- If it turns on.

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:02.909
- Alright, here we go. Here we
go. Here we go.

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:05.411
Whoa, it works!

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:08.014
I can't believe it! Yay!

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:10.950
That's what I'm talking
about! She's alive!

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.120
- Everything looks good, minus
a little crack in the bumper,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.355
which we found out via official appraiser.

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:18.291
This was only going to reduce the price

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.659
of Blake's Lamborghini by...

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.160
- Probably 10 grand.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:21.994
- Thank you so much.
Thanks for the good news.

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:25.565
- Right now's the perfect time
to mention that Phase three

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:27.867
is flaming cars.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.335
- For Blake's next challenge

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:31.404
we're bringing back his biggest nightmare.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.839
We have recreated the
flaming cars challenge

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.175
that costed Blake everything last time.

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:38.144
- Wow, that's a low blow.

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:40.012
- But seeing that
he's done this before,

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:42.248
we're gonna up the
stakes by dropping twice

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.250
as many cars as last time.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.452
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I got a lot to prove.

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:47.520
Redemption day!

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.855
- Blake spent the rest
of the night disassembling his

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:51.290
defense for phase two.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.292
And after a good night
of sleep, he was ready

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:55.261
to begin his defense for phase three.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.228
- It's eight in the morning.

00:09:56.228 --> 00:09:58.631
Just woke up. We got a
lot of work to do today.

00:09:58.631 --> 00:09:59.732
So let's get started.

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:01.167
- Here's the day three plan.

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.469
I'm gonna cut the bottom
out of a shipping container.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:05.438
I'm gonna drop it right on the car.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.139
Next I'm gonna take two more containers

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:09.075
and I'm gonna lead them up coming

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.776
to a point right above the car.

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:13.446
- And most importantly,
nothing flammable this time.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.880
- Do you think that will deflect a car?

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.715
- Yes sir.

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:17.316
- Oh, I thought you were
gonna say no.

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:19.952
Blake then asked his crew to
remove every piece of wood

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.153
that was in the container

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:23.823
because that's what ended
his challenge last time.

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.125
He then had them cut out
the bottom of the container

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.660
that would surround the Lamborghini.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.196
- The storage container
could put a lot of damage.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.430
- Completely crush it?
- Yeah.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.264
- It can?

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:34.734
- I mean, yeah, that
thing weighs a whole lot.

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:37.436
- And with that
being done, Blake just needs

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:39.905
to lower the container
carefully over the Lamborghini

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:41.340
without damaging it.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.643
- One scratch can
cost some thousands of dollars.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:44.710
You're good just like that?

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.712
- It is so close
to scraping the car.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.115
- Watch your fingers.
We're coming down!

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:52.251
- Yes! Yes!

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:53.886
- I cannot believe that!

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:55.621
- Next we're gonna
bring these containers together

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:56.422
to form a "V".

00:10:56.422 --> 00:10:58.257
- What if the car gets caught in there?

00:10:58.257 --> 00:10:59.392
- Yeah, that's, that can't happen, dude.

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:01.761
That's why we're putting
this pointy thing at the top.

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:04.697
- Do you think that will
actually deflect our car?

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:05.698
- A hundred percent.

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:08.434
- 20 minutes remain and then
we see if that Lamborghini

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:11.070
perishes just like his 500 grand.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.774
And as usual, Blake
utilized every last second.

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:17.109
3, 2, 1.

00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:19.745
Not quite sure what
that dirt accomplished.

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:21.614
Time is up.
- No!

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:25.384
- Let's see if unlike last
time, you survive phase three.

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:26.686
- Redemption!

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:29.188
- Blake,

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.991
you lost $500,000 from
this exact challenge.

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:33.059
How are you feeling?

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:34.060
- I feel pretty confident.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.062
- I think the viewers
wanna know one thing:

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:38.731
Did you put wood inside
of there like last time?

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:39.565
- A little bit.

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:41.033
No, I'm just kidding.
There's no wood in there.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:42.401
It was one of the biggest mistakes

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:43.803
I've ever made in my life.

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:46.372
- Moment of truth. Come on in.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:47.540
Three shipping containers.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.842
A bunch of dirt, concrete,

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:52.378
a weird like, pointed roof thing.

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:54.513
Versus 10 flaming cars!

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:55.648
Are you ready?

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:56.582
- Let's go dude.

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:58.384
- Light it on fire!

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.620
- Will Blake be
one step closer to going home

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.322
with the new Lamborghini filled

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:07.359
with a hundred thousand
dollars or be eliminated

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:09.562
and go home with nothing?

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.263
- We're about to find out.

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:14.633
3, 2, 1.

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:15.534
Drop it!

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:17.570
- Oh!

00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:20.606
- Oh, oh!

00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:21.941
- Oh. You did not want that.

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:25.044
- I feel like that's exactly
what he didn't want to happen.

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:27.046
Oh no.

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.314
Still feeling good?

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:29.148
- Not as good.

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:31.250
- Yeah, this is giving me some flashbacks.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.485
- It's giving you some flashbacks.

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:34.053
- Alright, ready for the next one?

00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:35.821
- Let's do it. Let's do it.

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:36.655
- Drop it.

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:41.660
- Oh my God, the roof looks
like it's already buckling.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.363
- And just in case Blake
loses the flaming cars

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:46.298
like last time, I'm gonna take this moment

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:48.134
and tell you about this amazing new phone.

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:49.769
What you're currently watching on is

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.438
the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:55.141
This phone can record slow-mo in 4K.

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:56.942
The camera on this is crazy.

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:59.111
We're like 200 feet
away and it's nighttime.

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.313
And look at that; crystal clear.

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:04.583
- Ho ho ho ho!
- And go ahead and drop it.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.553
- Oh!

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:08.654
- Oh, that hurt to watch.

00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:10.322
It also has a ton of new features

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:12.424
with Galaxy AI, like Photo Assist.

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.929
- Remember the last
challenge when the bumper

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:17.763
got cracked on the Lambo?

00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:19.098
You can just circle it like this

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:21.033
and then all you do is you
hit that eraser button.

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:23.569
And just like that, the bumper is fixed.

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:24.637
- Now I have a new car.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:25.838
- For the picture you do

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:28.474
- Whenever you're ready.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.780
This phone also has
circle to search Google,

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.216
which makes finding
information incredibly easy.

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.819
It would've helped Blake
a lot in the last video

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.655
to learn about the flammability
of wooden railroad ties.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:45.124
All he needed to do was
long press the home button,

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:49.628
highlight the railroad ties and
ask, "Is this flammable?"

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:52.531
- As you can see, railroad
ties are flammable.

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:54.466
- You would've learned
the answer instantly.

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:55.701
Could have just told you.

00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.371
I was genuinely impressed

00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:01.607
by this phone and I think you will be too.

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:04.043
So go to samsung.com, click
the link in the description

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:06.145
or scan this QR code to
check it out right now

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:07.546
and let's drop the next car.

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:13.085
- We dropped car after car,

00:14:13.085 --> 00:14:14.753
and with each one we could tell Blake

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:17.690
was getting more nervous,
but we also noticed that all

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.991
of the impacts were starting

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:20.659
to damage the crate itself.

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:23.162
- Your crate on the bottom is bowing.

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:25.197
- At this point,
the container protecting

00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:27.466
the Lambo was being crushed by the weight

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:28.801
and heat of the cars.

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:30.769
- I thought about this every day since

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:31.971
the last time I saw this.

00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:34.206
- And now it's
time for the final car!

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:37.443
- Yes!

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:38.878
- Oh no!

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.881
- Bro, it's gotta be
a thousand degrees in there!

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.149
This car's probably melting right now.

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:45.451
- We got the fire extinguisher.

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:48.487
- Somehow he's running so
fast. Be careful, Blake.

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:51.156
- I'm coming.

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:51.991
- How is it?

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:54.960
- It's okay. It's okay!

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:58.264
Yes! You like that?

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:01.166
- If one more car was dropped, this crate

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:02.101
would've collapsed.

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:04.336
You stopped 10,000 bullets.
- Easy.

00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:06.939
- You caught a car out of mid air.

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:09.575
You've now deflected ten flaming cars.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.744
- Now its time for phase four.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.112
- Bring on the train.

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:15.247
- The timer has officially started.

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:16.081
- I gotta go.

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:18.083
- Good luck on phase four.

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:19.018
- God speed.

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:20.419
- What is he even running at?

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.254
- Blake knew that the train was going

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:24.390
to be the most deadly attack yet,

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.059
so he wasted no time in getting started.

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:29.161
- I think the best way to
stop a train is to derail it.

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:30.396
That's what I've tried to build here.

00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:32.064
All these railroad ties are tucked snug,

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:34.700
and all of these are
gonna go under the train.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.135
The train's gonna hit 'em like that.

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:37.970
And if I do that a hundred more times,

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.439
I don't see the train just
blowing past all that.

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:43.242
The railroad ties lost me
the challenge last video.

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:44.476
This time they'll save me.

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:46.745
I just need two inches
off the track and I win.

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:48.147
- Two inches is a lot though.

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:49.081
- My man.

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:50.582
And then once I have all this done,

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:52.184
I can just put concrete on top.

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:54.486
I think that's gonna work,
man. I think that's gonna work.

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:56.121
- Blake worked
with his crew throughout

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.891
the entire night and when I
showed up the next morning,

00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:02.027
it was obvious that this
challenge had taken a toll on him.

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:02.895
What's up, Jimbo?

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:04.163
- What happened to your voice?

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:05.764
- I'm like dying out here.

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:08.400
- As you guys know, he lost
$250,000 in this video.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.936
He lost half a million
dollars in this video.

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:13.105
I think Blake is sick and tired of losing.

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:14.940
He has an army going super hard.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.842
They're currently stacking the cars

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:19.678
that we dropped on phase
three on the train tracks.

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:21.814
But time was still ticking down.

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.883
And in order to stop this
train and take his Lambo home,

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:27.152
Blake began adding a lot more objects

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.955
to the tracks, like shipping
containers, mattresses

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.156
to cushion the impact...

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:33.492
- Blake's worked so hard.
I'm now on his team.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:34.426
- And water tanks.

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:35.828
- Blake really seems to
know what he's doing.

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:37.529
Too bad, there's only 11 minutes left.

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:39.665
At this point, Blake
did everything he could

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.767
to finish his build before time ran out,

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:43.902
and it was actually
starting to look impressive.

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:45.738
- This is it.
- Three...

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.039
- The final stretch,

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:49.508
- Two, one.
- Last line of defense.

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:51.310
- Time's up. Stop. Turn it off.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.011
Turn it off.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.046
Time is officially up!

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:55.047
- Oh my God.

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:57.616
- From phase one
shipping containers, phase two's

00:16:57.616 --> 00:17:00.452
mattresses, and even phase
three's burning cars.

00:17:00.452 --> 00:17:02.521
Blake, you somehow used all the resources

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:04.189
from the previous phases.

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:06.325
- Let's see if you're
driving home in a Lamborghini

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:08.394
or if I'm dropping you off at your house.

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:10.262
- Bring that train on, man. Bring it on.

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:13.232
- Before we ram everything,
we need to back the train up.

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:14.533
We're gonna go really far back.

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:17.169
That way the train can
pick up a lot of speed

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:19.338
before it hits everything.
Sounds like a good idea?

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:20.539
- No, that sounds awful.

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:21.840
- Be honest, Blake. Do you think

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.042
your Lamborghini will survive?

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.309
- God, I hope so, Jimmy.

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:26.311
- And of course we had to
put the Feastables logo

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:27.146
on the train.

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:28.480
It's the best chocolate on earth.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.783
Do yourself a favor and
try the new formula,

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:33.085
but for now, it's time
for the biggest moment

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:34.053
of Blake's life.

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.721
Let's see if he wins a Lamborghini.

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:36.989
Blake, any last words?

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.290
- Give it all you got.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.692
- Send the train.

00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:42.161
Here it comes.

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:43.896
- Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:44.730
- It's coming!

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.466
- It's gonna speed up
until it hits 35 miles an hour

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:48.967
right before impact.

00:17:48.967 --> 00:17:50.202
- Dude, it is going quick!

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:52.237
- It's just gonna
derail. It's just gonna derail.

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:53.172
- Here she comes!

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:56.008
Let's see if it was all worth it!

00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:12.925
- Oh, wait, wait, wait!

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.294
- Blake, it derailed!
- Wait, I think it stopped!

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:16.895
- Oh my God!

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:18.297
- Blake, I've never
seen someone this happy!

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:19.965
- Oh wow, you derailed it!

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:22.034
- Oh my God. Oh my God. I did it!

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:23.335
Oh!

00:18:26.638 --> 00:18:27.873
Oh my God!

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:29.675
- This is your new Lamborghini, Blake!

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:31.677
Not only did he win the Lamborghini,

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.345
but he also got all this money!

00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:34.213
- Yes!

00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:35.147
- Congrats.

00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:36.081
- I did it!

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:38.016
- You wanna know the best
way to end this video, Blake?

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:38.617
- What?

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:41.120
- By them going to Walmart and
buying Feastables right now.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.088
It's the best tasty
chocolate on the planet.

00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:44.957
Third time's the charm.
See you guys later!

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.391
- Yes!
