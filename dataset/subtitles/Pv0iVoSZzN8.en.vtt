00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.969
I just started this ten minute timer and
when it hit zero

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.238
that room all the way over there,
full of money will explode.

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:09.408
And the only man that can stop it
is this man in this straight jacket.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.043
This video is completely real time.

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:13.279
You'll notice it's exactly 10 minutes long.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:15.147
There are no cuts.
You see everything.

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:17.016
And if Darcy does not escape
his jacket

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:20.052
and get through all five floors of
this tower and press that button

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.655
before the timer hits
zero, his money explodes.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:23.756
All right, he's coming down.

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.691
Okay,
this is our first ever real-time shoot.

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.137
- I got to go quick.
- Get in here, let's go.

00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:28.708
Go, go. 
Hey, hurry, unhatch this.

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.801
Wait, how did he get out of that jacket 
so fast?

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.559
It doesn't matter. This next
floor is twice as hard to escape.

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:36.255
Slower, slower, slower.

00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:37.309
Holy.

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:38.680
You put fire in there?

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.940
Okay,
so to get out of that metal cage,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.442
you need to use the lock pick 
on the floor, hurry up.

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.498
- Faster! 
- Darcy! Come on.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:46.276
Come on.

00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:47.580
Oh my gosh, come on.

00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:50.474
Even with a tool,
picking a lock takes some fidgeting.

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:54.253
He has to perfectly align all three pins
inside the lock in order to break free.

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:57.200
By the way, in order to prove this video 
is 100% real-time.

00:00:57.225 --> 00:00:59.669
starting now, you're going to see 
an unbroken shot of Darcy

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:00.901
in the corner of the full video.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:04.372
And as of now, a minute has gone by
and he's still in the first room.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.998
And remember, he still needs to get through

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:08.997
all five floors of this tower
and press the button in time...

00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:10.089
The button's right here.

00:01:10.114 --> 00:01:12.364
...to keep his quarter
of a million dollars from exploding.

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:13.439
I'm getting so much anxiety.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.874
Please go faster

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.208
Wait, Mack, he's picking the lock.

00:01:16.232 --> 00:01:17.925
Is he making good time or not?

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.787
So now, yeah,

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:21.326
But he's about to go down
to an even more difficult room.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:22.214
Be careful.

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:23.426
Don't catch a fire.

00:01:23.862 --> 00:01:24.830
Darcy, go.

00:01:24.864 --> 00:01:26.194
- Go! Go!
- Come on, what are you doing, bro? go.

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:27.353
He's coming down the rope,

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.621
he's in the glue room now.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.551
Welcome to floor number four.

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:31.477
Come on.

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:32.625
He's already made it 
to floor four.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:33.778
This is floor number four.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:34.369
- Ok.
- What is it?

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:37.163
So this entire floor
is now covered in glue.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.595
He has to choose between monkey barring
or walking across the glue.

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:43.632
And I would very much advise
he does not walk across the glue.

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:44.904
So far so good on the monkey bars.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:45.671
Keep going, buddy.

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:46.571
Come on.

00:01:46.596 --> 00:01:47.979
- Come on, Darcy do it!
- Let's do it.

00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:49.470
Two minutes has gone by.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:50.923
Go on your head, man.

00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:51.790
Oh, no.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.250
Why are you spinning? 
Stop spinning.

00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:55.681
If he falls, that is not good,

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.259
because that is the stickiest
glue in the world.

00:01:58.292 --> 00:02:00.127
I'm not even joking,
he'll lose his shoes.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.774
Oh, yeah.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.032
It's already been 2 minutes.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.751
Dude, he's swinging. 
He didn't touch the ground once.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.664
The man is glueless.
He made it to the exit.

00:02:12.853 --> 00:02:13.499
Oh, yeah.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.800
He's about to lift up that lid.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.936
And now he's about to enter
the craziest room.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:17.937
Keep taking us down.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.665
Watch this. You're going to see him
jump down.

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:21.860
Oh my God, boys, I'm so tired.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:24.677
Oh, Darcy's struggling,

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.390
but he's making his way down 
the rope onto floor three,

00:02:27.415 --> 00:02:28.514
the boulder room.

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:30.349
This one should be pretty simple.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.235
All right, Darcy,
See that giant boulder?

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:33.995
Yes.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.023
Well, these two ropes are the only thing
preventing it from barreling down the ramp.

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:39.158
There's also a machete.

00:02:39.183 --> 00:02:41.452
and let's just say 
you'll need it to get out of this room.

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:42.328
You're losing time.

00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:43.618
what do you think you'd do with the knife?

00:02:43.673 --> 00:02:45.179
- I'm trying to cut these ropes.
- Cut that rope.

00:02:45.204 --> 00:02:46.548
You're running out of time.

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:51.343
Normally in our videos, when someone 
does something this slow,

00:02:51.368 --> 00:02:52.872
we cut it out, but this is life.

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.870
We literally can't cut it out.
I am freaking out.

00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:55.774
Seven minutes remain.

00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:57.409
He's almost through the first of two
ropes.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.545
This is like some James Bond stuff 
right here.

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:02.590
As he goes lower, the floors are
going to get harder and take longer.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.359
He's actually not making as good
pace as you would want him to make.

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:06.719
That rope is going to take him
the longest

00:03:06.744 --> 00:03:07.959
because of how thick it is.

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:08.582
Cut the rope.

00:03:08.607 --> 00:03:10.753
- He's wasting a lot of time on this.
- He's behind right now.

00:03:10.778 --> 00:03:11.934
This knife is so dull.

00:03:12.372 --> 00:03:13.259
You're going to have to hurry.

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.942
Under seven minutes remain 
before your $250,000 explodes.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.848
Bro is still cutting the rope.

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:22.632
Jimmy, what's going
to happen here?

00:03:22.657 --> 00:03:23.844
When he cuts that second rope?

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.337
Something crazy is going to happen.

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:28.153
And Darcy, what do you think 
is going to happen when you cut that rope?

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.542
All right, I guess Darcy's locked in.

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:34.370
Jimmy, what is going to happen
when he cuts the rope?

00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:36.982
This boulder is going to go, 
I guess, through the window.

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.598
- Tell me, please,
- All you need to do...

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.401
- Yes.
- Is hold onto that when he cuts the rope.

00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:41.187
Okay, That's. That's.

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:41.854
I can handle that.

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:46.100
There's no way I'm losing this 250
grand because of this stupid rope.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:49.526
Jimmy, why did you find the slowest
man possible at cutting a rope?

00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:50.663
Darcy, hurry up.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.799
Like I told
you at the start, this is real time.

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:54.867
You're seeing everything.

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:56.869
Obviously,
Darcy's pretty occupied right now,

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.771
but if you could talk to us,
he'd probably tell us about the fact

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:00.372
that he's a world
class escape artist,

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:02.274
but apparently is not the best
at cutting ropes.

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:04.252
Darcy, you spent a whole minute on this.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.002
Oh, my God.

00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:08.010
Cut faster, come on.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.142
Bro, you have got to cut 
the rope a lot faster.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.572
Oh my gosh.

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:14.987
Oh, he's about to finish the last
rope.

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:16.735
Darcy, push the boulder down the ramp.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.822
So, the boulders is going to...

00:04:17.846 --> 00:04:19.102
- You'll see in a bit.
- Okay.

00:04:19.127 --> 00:04:20.041
He's pushing the boulder now.

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:20.752
- Brace yourself.
- What the...

00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:21.549
Back up.

00:04:25.158 --> 00:04:26.065
- Keep going.
- What?

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.234
Darcy, quick, 
grab that rope from the ceiling

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:30.569
and attach it to the latch
on the front of your pants.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:33.239
Make 100% sure that it's connected.

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:34.206
What is he going to do?

00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:35.307
All right, now, jump down.

00:04:35.307 --> 00:04:37.018
Step out to the edge
and turn around.

00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:37.979
- All right.
- Watch this.

00:04:38.012 --> 00:04:38.658
Watch what?

00:04:38.683 --> 00:04:40.432
Am I going to have to jump, Jimmy?

00:04:40.457 --> 00:04:41.846
Oh my God, he's about to jump.

00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:43.095
Go to your right.
Go to your right.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.959
What is he going to do?

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:45.784
- What is he doing?
- He is about to jump.

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:47.786
All right, Darcy,
you're going to have to jump down.

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:49.822
Oh my God, how am I going to do this?

00:04:49.847 --> 00:04:52.074
- Let's go, Darcy.
- Darcy, jump.

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:56.705
What the... Okay.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.557
He has exactly 5 minutes left.

00:04:58.565 --> 00:04:59.341
Stop the crane.

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.213
Stop the crane, stop the crane,

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.571
stop the crane.

00:05:02.814 --> 00:05:04.588
All right, I don't know, 
the crane operator is drunk.

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:06.505
You got to make it through
the lasers.

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:08.907
This floor is by far
the hardest yet.

00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:11.407
Not only does
he get to make it through this laser maze,

00:05:11.432 --> 00:05:13.379
if he accidentally touches a laser,

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.681
his money will instantly explode.

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:17.969
How am I going to do this?
There's so many lasers.

00:05:17.994 --> 00:05:19.218
While he's doing this laser room.

00:05:19.243 --> 00:05:22.096
I'm going to tell you guys about
T-Mobile, my new wireless partner.

00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:23.098
In here?

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:23.956
- Mack.
- What?

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:26.091
You probably know T-Mobile
from this coverage map.

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:28.174
- Yes, I do. I do.
- But here's the thing.

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:28.595
Okay.

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:30.768
You know,
great coverage is to be expected.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.139
Okay.

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:33.618
But what T-Mobile has 
that other carriers don't...

00:05:33.643 --> 00:05:35.219
Jimmy, he's halfway
through the lasers now.

00:05:35.244 --> 00:05:37.870
Oh, he's on our side.
But what makes T-Mobile special

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.432
is they have something 
called Magenta Status.

00:05:39.457 --> 00:05:40.706
Okay. What is Magenta Status?

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:42.808
It's where they treat
you like a VIP.

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:46.879
Just by using T-Mobile, 
you can get a reduced cost

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:47.646
at hotel rooms,

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:50.243
you can get free in-flight Wi-Fi, 
access to VIP lounge.

00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:52.092
- Go, go, go.
- All right.

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.285
T-Mobile,

00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:56.163
I'm stressing out. Sorry if I'm forgetting 
lines and a bunch of other stuff.

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:57.990
- And the best part is, Mack...
- It's right there, Jimmy, yes.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.625
- Yes, let me finish the T-Mobile ad.
- Okay.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:02.328
And the best part is... 
He's jumping in the water.

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:04.463
It's all available. Day one,
when you switch to T-Mobile.

00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:06.830
So, if you're not currently using T-Mobile,
start using now.

00:06:06.855 --> 00:06:08.334
You can get all these perks 
literally today.

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:09.260
Let me just catch my breath here.

00:06:09.284 --> 00:06:11.502
See how at tmobile.com/status.

00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:12.984
Oh, he's in the water.

00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:14.039
Oh my God.

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.208
All right, this is it, 
the last level.

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:19.133
He now has to open the four valves
in each quarter of the room,

00:06:19.158 --> 00:06:20.946
allowing all the water to drain,

00:06:20.946 --> 00:06:22.648
Then he can escape out
the front door

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.750
and hit the button
to save his money from blowing up.

00:06:24.775 --> 00:06:26.137
You got to turn these.

00:06:26.237 --> 00:06:27.018
Turn these things?

00:06:27.073 --> 00:06:28.530
- Turn.
- Turn the knob.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:29.288
What's he doing?

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:30.682
Actually, don't help him.

00:06:30.707 --> 00:06:32.268
Let's see if he's smart enough 
to win the money.

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:36.095
Will he be able to hold his breath
long enough

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:39.315
to unscrew all four valves,
or will he run out of time?

00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:41.467
Did the water come out?

00:06:43.702 --> 00:06:44.636
Hey, he did it.

00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:46.438
While this guy is doing 
this intense challenge,

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:48.346
I want tell you about the greatest
tasting chocolate on the planet.

00:06:48.503 --> 00:06:49.134
Feastables.

00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:49.947
Mack.

00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:52.053
What do you think of Feastables?

00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:52.838
Oh, it's my favorite.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.116
Oh no, he's going for the one 
he just finished.

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:58.917
Hey, hey.
No, no.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.688
Do the other one, do the other one.

00:07:00.713 --> 00:07:02.549
- You got to keep going.
- There's four.

00:07:02.638 --> 00:07:03.836
How much time is left?

00:07:04.408 --> 00:07:05.257
Oh, three minutes.

00:07:06.424 --> 00:07:06.825
Yeah.

00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:08.657
He actually kind of
just wasted, like, 30 seconds.

00:07:08.682 --> 00:07:10.518
He could do this if you just hurries up.

00:07:11.861 --> 00:07:13.424
Come on, catch your breath, let's go.

00:07:13.744 --> 00:07:16.468
Mack, he's about to go under, 
go around this side, see if it opens.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.494
He didn't do it yet. He didn't do it yet.

00:07:21.596 --> 00:07:22.643
All right, keep turning.

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:27.401
- Oh, he did it.
- Other side, other side.

00:07:29.214 --> 00:07:30.947
- Oh my God.
- Two down, two to go, baby.

00:07:32.818 --> 00:07:34.829
All right. He's now making
his way to the other side.

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:36.688
- You got to go swim down.
- Oh my God

00:07:36.688 --> 00:07:38.821
This is coming down to the wire.

00:07:38.846 --> 00:07:43.662
I cannot imagine how absolutely
exhausted he is right now.

00:07:44.549 --> 00:07:45.612
Ok.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:49.535
All right, so he has two minutes 
and 10 seconds to, right over here,

00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:51.844
press that red button 
or his money will explode.

00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:52.901
It's coming down to the wire.

00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:54.463
You got it. You got it.

00:07:54.565 --> 00:07:55.383
I don't know what to do.

00:07:55.407 --> 00:07:58.477
Normally, we do cuts and edits,
but this is like real time.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.279
Everything I'm saying is making it.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:02.548
- Oh, he's got less than two minutes. Bro.
- There’s just two minutes.

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:04.338
- Hey, less than two minutes.
- Go faster.

00:08:04.378 --> 00:08:06.166
He's getting close, he's getting close.

00:08:07.783 --> 00:08:08.687
He got it.

00:08:08.687 --> 00:08:09.997
He just did it, he got all four.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.845
He did it.

00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:12.963
All right, the final door,
a minute, 50 seconds.

00:08:12.988 --> 00:08:13.725
All right, what now?

00:08:13.725 --> 00:08:15.794
Now he has to open this door, run
and press the button.

00:08:15.794 --> 00:08:17.529
- How much time does he have?
- Just under 2 minutes.

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:18.630
How is he going to pull this off?

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:19.541
I don't get it.

00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:24.751
You're going to get wet if you stand there,
you might want to back up.

00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:25.504
Why?

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:26.205
Open it.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:29.008
There is so much more water 
that still needs to drain.

00:08:31.743 --> 00:08:33.104
- All right, Mack, hey.
- Go faster.

00:08:33.128 --> 00:08:35.556
Mack, in case he fails, 
that bomb will blow up,

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:39.204
so I need you to just, hide behind 
the sandbags over there if he messes up,

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:40.204
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:40.979
Just trust me.

00:08:43.588 --> 00:08:44.672
What do I do?

00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:46.091
You have to unscrew all the latches.

00:08:46.572 --> 00:08:48.026
Get him out of there, come on.

00:08:48.103 --> 00:08:50.274
Almost a minute, come on, come on.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.296
Bro...

00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:52.798
I don't know if he's
going to make it at this point.

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.933
The door stuck because there's
too much water pressure.

00:08:55.033 --> 00:08:56.338
He needs to wait for it to drain
more.

00:08:57.227 --> 00:08:59.346
Wait, Jimmy, the water is starting
 to come out the front door.

00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:01.768
Turn it, turn it, turn it and pull it.

00:09:01.907 --> 00:09:02.783
Pull it.

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:05.290
You got to go, buddy. 
You've got to go.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.526
He's stuck in that one, 
he can't get it.

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:12.190
Something's wrong.

00:09:12.674 --> 00:09:14.399
Bro, this is it. 
He's going to fail.

00:09:14.424 --> 00:09:15.626
He can't figure out
how to open the door.

00:09:15.651 --> 00:09:18.369
He literally has 45 seconds 
to hit this button.

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:20.068
It stuck, come on.

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:22.327
Bro, he can't get these latches off 
to save his life.

00:09:22.352 --> 00:09:23.053
Bro...

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:24.940
What is he doing?

00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:29.463
Come on.

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.681
Come on. You got 30 seconds, 
come on, come on.

00:09:31.753 --> 00:09:32.714
Go!

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:34.502
You have to slide through the door 
and hit the button.

00:09:35.056 --> 00:09:36.291
Go faster. Go.

00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:37.190
Go!

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:38.526
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:39.977
Hurry, before the bomb blows up.

00:09:42.471 --> 00:09:44.338
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:45.884
And after he won

00:09:45.884 --> 00:09:48.915
with 19 seconds left, we cleared 
the money out of the way the bomb,

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.255
and asked him
what he was going to spend it on.

00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:51.639
I'm having a baby tomorrow.

00:09:51.663 --> 00:09:52.257
What?

00:09:52.257 --> 00:09:54.326
And then we blew the building up.

00:09:54.326 --> 00:09:55.460
Oh Gosh.

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:57.963
I hope you enjoy the explosion.

00:09:57.963 --> 00:09:59.965
We have to make this video 
exactly 10 minutes. Goodbye.
