00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
- So this here is my
Titanium iPhone 15 Pro

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.040
that I've been using
with no case for 88 days,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.360
or about three months now.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.130
I wanna do more longer term reviews.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.920
Not that three months is a
super long time to have a phone,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.430
but in the usual smartphone
review space, at least,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.010
for me, it's one to two weeks with a phone

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.680
before I'm summarizing
everything from my experience

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.730
and putting it into a review.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.020
And so the longer I use a phone,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.910
the more I'm able to
actually uncover about it,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.340
especially about the way I use it.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.160
So as someone who carries
two phones all the time

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.330
and the iPhone typically is
in my pocket for a long time,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.460
I have a lot more stuff for this iPhone.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.920
So first things first, I
haven't put my phone in a case

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.120
since the day I bought it.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.400
Sometimes I regret
this, sometimes I don't.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.290
It's pretty rare that I
actually drop my phone

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.840
and this one also hasn't yet been dropped,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.560
but it does show some pretty
normal signs of wear and tear.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.790
But it's nothing too concerning.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.790
Like, I always start to get
some bigger cuts, like this,

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.210
on my front display glass

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.150
because of my refusal to
put on a screen protector.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.160
And these here aren't any more

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.690
or less than usual despite, you know,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.950
the fancy ceramic shield.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.350
But I do really like
the switch to titanium

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.780
for the frame and the side
rails around this phone.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.420
It looks way better than
the stainless steel.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.410
It's also lighter

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.540
and I am also glad I went
with this lighter color

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.570
because this combo seems to
show the fewest fingerprints.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.590
It looks the cleanest.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.970
Overall, though I feel like I'm happy

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.830
with this spec that I went with.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.300
Now, long-term behavior,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.180
there are three really interesting
things about this phone.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.310
Two of them, I feel
like I'm using way less

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.230
than I thought I would and one of them,

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.530
I'm using basically exactly
as much as I thought I would.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.740
So first of all, in the
camera of the Pro iPhone,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.150
this was the first year Apple announced

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.820
this sort of neat multiple
focal lengths feature.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.850
So you can hit that 1x
button three different times

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.430
and get three different focal
lengths, 24 millimeters,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.140
then 28 millimeters,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.890
then 35 millimeter focal lengths,
all with the same quality.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.190
I pretty much never use this feature.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.023
I don't know if that means

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:01.980
I'm, like, not a true
smartphone photographer,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.430
but I always just frame things at 1x

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.930
and that seems to be the end of it for me.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.070
So I just don't use that feature,

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.900
even though our testing
does show that it works.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.750
But I still think the new
button they added to iOS 17,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.690
where if you zoom in on a
photo, a crop button appears

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.180
and that actually crops the photo.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.300
That's significantly more
useful of a feature for me

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.040
and I actually think for
a lot of other people.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.050
But then the action button is another one.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.150
So this is a pretty big headlining feature

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.680
on this year's Pro iPhones,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.470
this rare ability to
actually customize something

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.303
on your iPhone.

00:02:32.303 --> 00:02:34.140
So I definitely feel like the UI

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.360
that they built into the
settings is still one

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.840
of the weirdest most
un-Apple-like stapled in pieces

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.160
of UI I've ever seen them do.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.050
But hey, it works, it's great.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.010
You can map the button

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.080
to basically almost anything you want.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.550
But a lot of people
made a great observation

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.590
about the placement of this button

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.700
when the phone first launched,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.800
which is, like, the
reason that mute switch

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.390
that we used to have was so great,

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.950
is 'cause it was sort of
tucked up in the corner

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.783
and out of the way.

00:02:56.783 --> 00:02:58.740
So you could just never
even think about it.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.440
Just leave your phone on
mute forever and be fine.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.590
But Apple is very stubborn
about placing this action button

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.190
in the exact same spot where
the mute switch used to be,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.620
which does mean it's
kind of out of the way.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.690
It's a little bit, annoyingly,
not very reachable,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.580
especially when you use
the phone with one hand.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.340
So when I first got the phone,
I mean, I was going nuts

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.680
with all the possibilities
of the crazy things

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.450
that I could think of to do with it.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.790
First thing I did was map
it to Google Assistant,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.700
since I never use Siri,
but having a quick toggle

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.180
to the better assistant is
hilarious and more useful to me.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.190
Then I later briefly switched it

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.347
to toggle starting a new voice
conversation with ChatGPT.

00:03:36.347 --> 00:03:39.750
So the ChatGPT chatbot has its own voice

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.000
and you can have a voice
conversation with it

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.200
and it's really cool,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.600
but it isn't the most
useful thing in the world.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.840
Like, it's cool that it can
do complex math and reasoning

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.640
and generate new things for you,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.700
but then it can't see your
calendar or tell you the weather

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.140
or do anything current events related.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.850
So that didn't last long.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.790
So then I switched to
starting a new dialogue box

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.810
for a new task in my to-do
list app of choice, TickTick,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.920
and this one's pretty cool.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.170
You hit the button and it
literally opens a text box

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.910
and you just start typing a new task.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.410
Really, really nice if you just happen

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.330
to remember something somewhere.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.760
But I also totally still
have the muscle memory

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.180
to just go home and open
the app whenever I need it.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.920
I also have a lock screen task to do that.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.110
So it was a little bit redundant for me.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.700
So I've ended up with my action button

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.380
just being set to open the
camera and that's the fastest,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.630
most convenient way to
get to the camera for me.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.700
Yes, there is a lock screen shortcut also,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.610
but I just find that
if I am doing something

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.050
and I just need to quickly
get a picture of something

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.690
that's happening or
something's about to go away,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.523
I don't wanna miss it.

00:04:40.523 --> 00:04:42.390
Like, I just have this muscle memory now

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.760
to just hit that button
and just take the photo.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.650
You can actually have
it open to take a selfie

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.270
or take some other types
of photos or videos.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.250
I just have it open to
viewfinder and I'm good.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.410
So then, of course, USB Type-C

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.140
was the biggest headlining feature

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.260
of this newest generation of
iPhones, hilariously enough.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.080
Slow USB 2.0 speeds on the base iPhone 15,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.640
but then USB 3.2 speeds
on the 15 Pro and Pro Max,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.860
which makes a pretty big difference

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.140
when importing tons of ProRes footage,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.970
even if it isn't Thunderbolt speeds yet.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.660
First of all, thank you,
Europe, it's about damn time.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.300
Even as someone who is a pretty
heavy wireless charger user,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.800
I do have to say, it is much nicer.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.750
It's been great to just have one cable

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.660
to charge almost
everything from this iPhone

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.460
to any Android phone to
the iPad Pro to my laptop.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.890
But unfortunately, I have
not been able to get rid

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.680
of my lightning cable just yet

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.380
because there are still
other things in my ecosystem,

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.430
in Apple's ecosystem,

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.160
that haven't switched to USB-C quite yet.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.270
Mostly because AirPods Max is
my headphones for traveling

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.180
of choice and I still have
to carry the lightning cable

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.380
everywhere just to charge those.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.570
But there's also still the Magic keyboard

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.310
and the Apple Magic Trackpad.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.200
I really don't know how
long it's gonna take Apple

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.850
to go through and also update

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.430
all of these things to be USB Type-C,

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.710
but I guess my lightning
cables are sticking

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.700
around a little while longer

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.680
until they refresh all that stuff.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.230
The AirPods Max came
out at the end of 2020,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.090
so word on the street is they may be due

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.940
for a refresh sometime
soon, but we don't know.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.890
Definitely get subscribed to
see the review of the new ones

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.530
whenever they do come
out, but as of right now,

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.363
they're still lightning.

00:06:17.363 --> 00:06:19.290
So there have been
several software updates

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.360
to the iPhone 15 lineup since it came out.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.240
It launched on iOS 17, which
made all types of headlines,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.480
but then we've already
made it to iOS 17.2.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.370
The new Journal app is live now,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.800
which I have a few friends
that use, but I don't use it.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.630
There's, of course, been
a bunch of bug fixes

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.910
and optimizations since
we heard about, you know,

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.430
the Instagram app and
those random heat problems.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.920
Those seem to also be fixed and gone.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.950
And there's also a
curious new little button

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.120
in the camera app.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.060
So if you go to Settings and then Camera

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.490
and then under Formats,
there's a new toggle

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.720
to be able to record spatial
video for the Apple Vision Pro.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.420
So things seem to be
lining up interestingly

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.170
for the Vision Pro to actually
launch sometime in January

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.030
or February, which should be pretty cool.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.560
And if you remember watching that one demo

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.780
of spatial videos on the Vision Pro, yes,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.170
you can record them on the
headset, which looks hilarious,

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.170
but you can also record them on an iPhone,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.710
specifically only on an
iPhone 15 or 15 Pro so far

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.600
because of the horizontal alignment

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.670
of the main and ultra-wide cameras.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.110
So if you go into the camera app

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.510
with that new check toggled, in video,

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.190
there's a little headset icon,

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.050
and if I select that, I'm now shooting

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.440
that special spatial video,
which means a few things.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.900
First of all, you must
turn your iPhone sideways

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.760
to landscape because your
eyes are next to each other

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.230
and not on top of each other.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.780
And it also will limit you to 1080p 30fps

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.570
because it's actually
processing two streams

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.530
of video at once,

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.840
one from the primary
camera that you can see,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.760
but then the other one
from the ultra-wide camera

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.593
for your other eye.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.460
So you can go crazy
right now and just go out

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.190
and start shooting a bunch of
spatial videos on your iPhone.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.080
But if you go watch them on your phone,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.240
they will look just like normal videos

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.620
because it's only gonna play back

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.000
the video from the main camera.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.180
If you wanna see and
appreciate the spatialness

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.450
of the video, you will
need an Apple Vision Pro.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.910
Now, I've actually gotten to
experience the App Vision Pro

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.360
a few more times since
that initial preview video

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.570
that I did from Apple Park, flex, I know.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.010
But what I've actually gotten to do

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.020
with it is shoot a bunch
of my own spatial videos

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.840
and then watch them back on the headset.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.500
And the main thing I really
learned is they look okay.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.510
I think the dramatic part is, like,

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.410
when you get the subject
within two, three, four feet

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.120
of the camera, then it's,
like, really dramatic,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.170
kind of like a 3D movie.

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.700
Then you see things popping out at you.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.890
So Pro tip, if you're gonna take a bunch

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.230
of spatial videos now,
that's the sweet spot

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.520
for it to actually be worth it.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.960
Oh, and also, another Pro tip,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.250
it took me months to learn this,

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.810
but if you ever have anything happening

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.680
on the Dynamic Island, you
can swipe across it to hide it

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.900
or change the view style,
in case you're annoyed

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.300
by, like, a train ticket
or an Uber delivery

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.920
that's taken up space up there

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.690
or something you just don't
wanna see up there anymore.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.270
So go ahead and swipe, the more you know.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.150
So clearly, you don't have to
upgrade your phone every year

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.000
or every two years or very often at all.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.220
But the more I use this phone, the 15 Pro,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.520
the more I'm confident that
this is one of the good years

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.660
to upgrade, from the updated
cameras to the USB Type-C

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.280
to the titanium.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.190
Like, there's the concept
of an upgrade sweet spot,

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.110
and I feel like this phone hit it,

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.060
especially for people
with much older iPhones.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.950
So I'll leave you with this.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.410
In the original iPhone 15 Pro Review,

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.660
I compared this phone to the Porsche 911

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.490
in that the design doesn't
really change a whole lot

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.900
from generation to generation.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.930
They, instead, spend a
really long time refining

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.960
and honing in on a slightly better version

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.100
of the same thing.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.950
So I just turned 30 recently.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.210
Still weird saying that out loud,

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.950
but for my 30th birthday, I
decided to take that plunge too.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.480
Yes, it is matte black,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.720
but I can now say that once
you start living with a 911,

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.570
you actually appreciate that strategy

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.830
just a little bit more.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.300
It is not flashy, it's
not dramatic, it's boring,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.020
it's predictable, it's
familiar, confidence inspiring.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.620
Also, this entire video, every single shot

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.753
was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.360
Thanks for watching.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.613
Catch you guys on the next one, peace.

00:10:21.512 --> 00:10:24.679
(bright upbeat music)
