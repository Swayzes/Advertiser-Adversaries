00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.642
(bright music)

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.603
- All right, it's finally here.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:13.110
This is the Apple Vision Pro.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.110
This is the beginning of Apple's
spatial computing journey.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.150
Their first headset, AR,
VR, wearable face computer,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.860
whatever you want to call
it, and this is the unboxing.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.500
So everything that I show
you guys in this box,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.140
it's gonna be a representation
of what you would get

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.640
should you decide to spend the $3,500

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.620
that it takes to get one of these,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.350
or in this case actually $3,900

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.050
because this is the 1TB Vision Pro.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.400
You'll see the accessories.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.740
You'll see it booted
up for the first time.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.510
And this is very much the beginning

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.510
of our Apple Vision Pro
investigation and series of videos.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.500
So definitely get subscribed

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.260
to make sure you're among
the first to see that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.340
when the rest of those come out.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.750
So big box, but the headset
is relatively small.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.602
Shout out to JerryRigEverything
for the knife.

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:09.185
(tape tearing)

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.448
And inside.

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:16.031
(gentle music)

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.243
This is a really soft box. Whoa.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.353
And this here is a third little box.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.460
So this is an incredibly flimsy box,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.350
but I'll just take this one out.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.030
So the three things we have now

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.830
are the Vision Pro headset in this box,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.620
the Vision Pro Zeiss lenses.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.820
So these are optical inserts.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.450
So if you have a prescription,
then these come in the box

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.610
and they will magnetically
attach to the headsets,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.180
so if you wear glasses, you
can still use the headset.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.180
And this is the optional $200 extra

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.830
Vision Pro Travel Case.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.440
This thing, this is a whole aesthetic.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.280
I'll get to that in a second.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.443
I'm just gonna leave that right here.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.500
But this is the headset itself.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.220
It's gonna slide, yep, out of this.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.803
(gentle music)

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.630
So this is like the size of,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.310
I mean, it's bigger than a Mac box.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.930
This might be bigger
than the Mac Studio box,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.220
but there you go.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.720
And it's got all the pull tabs.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.290
I do expect pretty good packaging here.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.740
This is such a high pressure
first gen product for Apple,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.080
so I'm expecting pretty good packaging

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.900
for this introduction
to a first gen thing.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.248
Take the tabs off.

00:02:47.248 --> 00:02:49.831
(gentle music)

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.596
(gentle music continues)

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.730
And then it's like a shoebox.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.120
Okay, so there's the headset.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.920
So the headset comes with
this little cover on it,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.860
and it's dressed up
with one of these bands.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.450
This band right here

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.860
is the one that you see
in all the commercials.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.740
It's this really soft,
stretchy fabric material,

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.630
and it's in this sort of cardboard head.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.910
This is the Solo Knit Band.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.770
There's another band
though that I'm pretty sure

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.370
comes with this that is
called the Dual Loop Band.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.550
So I'm gonna put this
to the side real quick

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.410
and see what else comes in
this like shoebox-size box.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.670
So this pops off. This is quality.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.920
And then we're into the inside,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.210
which is a Design by Apple
in California pamphlet.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.010
Oh, I bet there's stickers in here.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.813
Oh, there's a microfiber too. Okay.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.670
Then there is the Light Seal Cushion.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.260
Oh, I think you get two of these.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.070
Yeah, there's one thin Light
Seal and one thick Light Seal.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.930
I'll get to that in a second.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.390
And at the top, there's a
lot of explaining to do,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.663
some more heavy Vision Pro paperwork.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.780
And this is the Dual Loop Band.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.700
So this is the second band

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.040
that goes both around
the back of your head

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.690
and over the top of your head.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.020
We'll try that out for comfort
over the Solo Knit Band.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.370
And then there's your power.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.940
So the battery that
comes with the Vision Pro

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.900
is this thing right here.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.890
It's all very white.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.710
Everything in this box is
either white or silver.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.673
It's pretty heavy.

00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:37.422
(covering ripping)

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.650
So this smells pretty new. (chuckles)

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.903
It's got this white braided cable,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.230
and I don't know if Apple's
even called this MagSafe,

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.910
but at the end of this cable

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.690
is one proprietary connector right there.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.130
And that connector is what plugs

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.570
into the side of the headset.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.340
And this is the battery,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.960
the two and a half to three hour battery,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.090
that comes with Vision Pro.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.743
It says on the back actually
3,166 milliamp hours.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.170
I know a lot of phones

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.730
that have 5,000 milliamp hour batteries

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.140
that feel much lighter than this,

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.230
so I'm curious why this feels so heavy,

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.270
but that's the battery.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.700
And then in order to get more
than two and a half hours,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.830
or to charge the battery,

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.150
you have the cable,
USB-C, and the wall brick.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.500
So let's see what the wall brick says.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.500
I hope it charges fast. 30 watts.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.520
So not super fast, but this
is a 30-watt brick USB type C,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.080
and then a C to C braided cable.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.710
Okay, that's it for
the inside of this box,

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.390
so now let's go over these accessories.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.860
So, okay, let's do the paperwork first

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.440
because this is probably
the most common stuff.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.940
Everyone's gonna get this.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.120
This is a little booklet
of what's in the box

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.470
and a sort of a first.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.600
And that is all the
pairing it to your iPhone,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.570
putting it on for the first
time, connecting the straps.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.160
I'll show you guys this.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.160
Oh, and even how to store
the cable around the battery.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.070
So apparently you do not
wanna wrap it vertically,

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.590
but you do wanna wrap it horizontally

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.940
with a little bit of slack.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.720
Okay, I bet there's stickers.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.550
So polishing cloth, and that
is a different polishing cloth

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.540
to the one that comes with their monitors.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.290
Oh, it's nice and thin.
That's a nice polishing cloth.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.740
People were comparing it to
the like $20 polishing cloth

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.900
for the Studio display
and the Pro display,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.460
this is a different polishing cloth.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.540
The front of it is glass.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.920
You're probably gonna want to use this

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.480
to wipe it down once in a while,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.340
so I feel like this is
a microfiber I'll keep.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.600
I know some people unboxing this

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.760
who are gonna be very disappointed

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.030
in the lack of Vision Pro themed stickers.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.760
All right, so when you
buy an Apple Vision Pro,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.250
everyone actually has to go through

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.320
a sort of a face scanning process.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.320
So you actually use the iPhone
with the Face ID sensors

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.280
to measure the depth

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.100
and scan around your eyes and your face,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.190
and you end up with a
custom-fitted Light Seal.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.610
The Light Seal Cushion
is either thin or thick.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.440
So maybe you have the optical inserts

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.850
and you want it a little
further from your face

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.500
or you just want a little extra cushion,

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.713
this would be the thicker
cushion that you would use.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.210
Okay, so there you go.
That's the thicker cushion.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.270
But the idea is the Light
Seal around Vision Pro

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.240
is shaped to roughly match your face.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.190
It's not like exactly custom molded.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.900
It's more that they have a preset number

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.540
of different sizes and shapes,
and when you do the scan,

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.310
it picks the one that matches you the best

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.900
to give you the best immersion.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.223
Let's take the plastic or the
cardboard off of Vision Pro,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.160
and, huh, sort of a standard head size,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.840
I guess, right there.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.640
And if we take this
protective off the first time,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.790
dang, there's your glass.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.110
A lot of lights in this room,

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.570
so it's gonna be pretty reflective,

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.890
but now you can probably imagine

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.030
why people are gonna carry
this Vision Pro cloth.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.990
Notice it says Vision
Pro on the microfiber.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.120
Hopefully you can see that.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.950
But yeah, so when you get the headset,

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.210
you're gonna notice two things.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.790
One, this is the thicker version,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.400
this thinner version pops off.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.250
And two, this Light Seal.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.100
This is the custom Light
Seal that pops off,

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.630
and then you're just left with this.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.070
This is the entire computer
for Apple Vision Pro.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.540
It's pretty small.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.030
It's not unlike a lot
of other VR headsets,

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.390
but it's got this aluminum
housing around the outside.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.020
You can see the tons of sensors and glass,

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.390
and it is very front weighted.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:59.390
This Light Seal is what's
ideally shaped to match your face

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.860
and block the light out.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.710
It attaches just like AirPods Max,

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.360
you've seen AirPods Max
headphone covers just like that.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.193
There you go.

00:09:10.193 --> 00:09:12.783
And I'm gonna go with the
thin Light Seal Cushion.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.220
And there's the normal look
to the Vision Pro headset.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.830
Now let's take the Dual Loop Band out

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.030
because this is the other one that I.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.560
There's been a lot of
talk about the weight

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.850
of the Vision Pro,

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.220
and this is the reason
why Apple has decided

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.180
to include two bands in the box.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.980
There are different band sizes as well.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.720
So when you measure your
head, you're either getting

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.200
a small, medium, or a
large size for your bands.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.000
So I've got mediums of both of these.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.750
For this Dual Loop, let's
take it out so you can see.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.400
So much cardboard.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.510
There's two loops.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.080
One over your head and
one behind your head.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.570
So there's a very specific process

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.570
to taking off and attaching
these bands with Vision Pro.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.770
So I'm gonna put this
on for the first time

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.770
without booting it up just so
you can see how this works.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.873
So this is the Solo Band right here.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.590
Kind of goes around the back of your head.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.990
And then if I'm in the right, yep,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.000
this spot right here,
this, you just crank this

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.193
and it tightens it up.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.510
Yeah, and the weight is
really, basically just now

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.250
pulling it onto the front of your face.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.320
All the weight is on the front,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.203
and it kind of lands on your
cheeks and on your forehead.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.570
This is how it looks
in all the commercials.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.950
It's the most simple looking band.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.740
You can pull the band up or down

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.323
to kind of adjust the
way it sits on your head,

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.700
but as you can probably already tell,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.040
that might get a little uncomfortable.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.760
So to take this band off
and switch to the other one,

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.760
all you got to do is you see
this orange pull tab in here?

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.040
This orange pull tab is
just to release the band

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.120
from the Vision Pro.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.780
So if I pull that, it unclicks the metal,

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.993
and I pull that other one,
and it just pops right off.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.510
And that's the headset without
the band attached to it.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.920
And you have these little
pods here over each ear,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.330
which are a bunch of speaker drivers

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.400
pointing down into your ear.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.670
These are some seriously small components.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.530
They're so dense though,

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.630
like this is heavy despite being small.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.040
So if you wanna put the other band on,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.773
it's basically exactly as you'd expect.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.320
Attaches like that and like that,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.950
and now you can change it with Velcro.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.670
You can make it taller in
the top, taller in the back.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.630
So let's try it.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.070
Let's try taller in the
top and taller in the back.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.470
Well, that's so much
more well distributed.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.970
And I happen to adjust it
pretty close to my head

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.483
pretty much perfectly.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.870
That is gonna be much
easier to wear for longer,

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.060
but of course now you have this thing

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.140
across the top of your head,

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.970
so not everybody's gonna like that,

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.310
but I think it's immediately a better fit.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.950
It's more comfortable. Wow, okay.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.110
I'm probably gonna be
using that more often.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.600
But let's get to this travel case.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.970
So this I guess isn't really a travel case

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:19.230
as much as it's just like
a protective outer layer

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.540
for the glass since this whole outside,

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.580
which has a ton of fingerprints already,

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.080
is just covered in glass.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.780
You might wanna just pop it in here,

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.620
and then theoretically you can
maybe put that in a backpack.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.096
I don't know if you would
want to, but. (laughs)

00:12:35.096 --> 00:12:38.910
This is the external extra
Vision Pro Travel Case.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.040
It's got this handle on the top,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.953
but when it extends out a
little bit, that's nice.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.880
That's well thought. Nice and tight.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.524
And then

00:12:49.524 --> 00:12:52.357
(zippers rasping)

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.830
it opens up, and it's got sort of molding

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.410
in the places that you'd put the headset.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.940
So this is where the battery will go.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.120
And it's even got this
molded spot for the cable,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.780
so I can slide that in
there, Velcro it down,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.750
and the cable should be
able to just wrap in here.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.403
Then the other side,

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.713
another case?

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.060
And then it says this is where
your, oh, accessory pouch.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.490
So this is where you put polishing cloth,

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.550
power brick, and USB-C charging cable.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:31.140
These things make sense.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.700
Keep them in there.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.283
Activated carbon deodorizer. Do not eat.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.890
Then you put the headset in here,

00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:42.063
put the accessories in
there, and close it up.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.160
That's actually pretty solid.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.540
I know people were making fun of the price

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.140
of the $200 Vision Pro accessory case.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.450
But the thing is I wouldn't
wanna travel with this

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.890
without the case,

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.350
and I do think people are
gonna wanna travel with this.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.610
The number one use case

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:01.610
I've been looking forward to
with Vision Pro is airplanes,

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.680
so I'm gonna need a pretty big backpack

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.210
to have extra room for all of this,

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.943
but I do think I'm gonna be trying that.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.370
Let's boot it up for the first time.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.540
Let's get it all set up.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.590
So this is what you'll have to do

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.840
when you get out Vision Pro, ready?

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.770
Open the case. Get your battery out first.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.010
The battery has a
special cable on the end.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.780
Get your headset out, maybe
take off your knit cap

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.950
or whatever this is called.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.790
Pick between your thick
or thin Light Seal cover.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:33.900
I'll go thin.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.900
Pick between your Dual Loop
or your Solo Knit Band.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.560
I'll go Solo Knit.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.700
And then if you wanna charge it up

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.800
or plug it straight into the wall,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.640
the battery doesn't appear
to have a removable cable.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.450
I'm sure some Apple Store has
some tool to remove this cable

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.250
whenever they need to replace it,

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.820
but what it does have is
a USB-C port on the side.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.530
So if I ever wanna just plug the headset

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.520
straight into the wall,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.890
I'm plugging the battery
straight into the wall.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.530
But assuming it's charged,
the last step here

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.690
is to go to the left side of the headset.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.180
And you see this little proprietary

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.160
circular thing right here?

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.730
All I'm gonna do is line
up the dot with the bottom

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.730
and then twist and it'll
start to glow just like that,

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.080
and that means it's starting
up for the first time.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.570
Takes about a minute to boot up.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.830
And then

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.050
I will go right into the setup process,

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.783
which I'm sure you'll
all wanna see on camera.

00:15:34.755 --> 00:15:35.588
Ah.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:42.718
(gentle startup music)

00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:44.468
And I see a checkbox.

00:15:46.001 --> 00:15:49.168
(Vision Pro bleeping)

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.640
How do I look? Ridiculous?

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.263
Do I look great or ridiculous?

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.000
Decent? Okay, I can see you guys.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.800
So there's a little hello script,

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.510
and it's booting up for the first time,

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.470
but I'm gonna save this,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.560
all of this setup and all
of this using Vision Pro.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.970
That's gonna be the next video.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.090
So last thing I'm gonna show
you is the Zeiss lenses.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.970
If you happen to wear glasses
or have a prescription,

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.250
you will be able to use this headset

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.500
as well with that prescription

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.830
with a $100 pair of Zeiss lenses.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.270
I think it's 100 bucks for readers

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.700
and 150 for prescription lenses.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.910
But either way, they're really quite small

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.260
and they're magnetic.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.480
And since Zeiss runs the world of glass,

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.530
this is kind of your only option
is these things right here.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.043
All you got to do though to
attach them is to this off.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.770
And you grab one of the
prescription lenses,

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.029
and you just

00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:49.890
(lenses snapping)

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.240
snap it in place like that.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.440
Hope you could see that.

00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:55.142
(lenses snapping)

00:16:55.142 --> 00:16:55.975
It's a pretty strong magnet.

00:16:55.975 --> 00:16:57.030
I do not have a prescription,

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.190
but what I've been told
is then you go ahead

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:04.190
and scan this code with the headset

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.150
so that it knows what your prescription is

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.460
and adjusts everything accordingly,

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.140
which I think is pretty well thought out.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.500
But I think that's where I
have to end it, so stay tuned.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.250
Definitely get subscribed
for the following videos

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.810
'cause you already know I
got to set this thing up.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.090
I got to show you guys
how to use Vision Pro.

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:22.380
Show you guys what I've been talking about

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.590
as far as weight distribution,
the games that you can play,

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:27.990
the experiences you can have,
the movies you can watch,

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.460
the apps that it has.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.640
There's a lot more, so get
subscribed to see that.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.890
And big shout out to the
sponsor of this video, Anker.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.690
So if you're even considering
getting a Vision Pro,

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.180
you probably already have an iPhone,

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.400
in which case it would be
good to at least know about

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.470
Anker's new MagGo lineup.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.180
So they've got some charging accessories.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.370
This one I think is pretty
sweet. This is a three-in-one.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.930
So it's called the
Wireless Charging Station.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.390
It unfolds, it's lightweight and compact,

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.460
and you can charge three things at once.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.530
Your iPhone up on the MagSafe charger,

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.970
then something like AirPods down here

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.410
at the Qi charger at the bottom,

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.020
and flip out an Apple Watch charger.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.540
And a 30 minute charge can
give your Apple Watch Series 9

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.950
almost 50% battery.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.720
But this one is actually
super convenient to me.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.310
This is the MagGo Power Bank.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.550
So again, MagSafe, slaps right
on the back of the phone,

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.260
but it's got the screen on it

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.670
so you can always charge on the go.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.440
And there's a built-in battery,

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.970
and we love good built-in battery,

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.650
but it's 10,000 milliamp hours,

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.430
so you can charge your iPhone
15 Pro almost two full times

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.750
without even plugging into the wall.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.280
And there's also a nice little stand,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.850
so you can have it in a,
what's that feature called,

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.740
standby mode, whenever you want

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.810
just by popping it up like that.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:34.643
So I like that too.

00:18:34.643 --> 00:18:36.090
So both of these things
can charge your devices

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.160
at up to 15 watts wirelessly.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.170
And they're good with Qi2 as well,

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.290
so they can charge your non
iPhones if you want that.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.400
So I think it's worth it.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.260
Check it out. Link in the description.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.250
And shout out to Anker again

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.630
for sponsoring this portion of the video.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.770
So that's been it.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.700
Thanks again for watching,

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.190
and I'm gonna go set up my Vision Pro now.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.024
Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.

00:18:56.024 --> 00:18:59.524
