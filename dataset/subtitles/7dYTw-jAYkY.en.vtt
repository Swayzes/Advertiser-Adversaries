00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.934
I'm going to spend the next

00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:04.771
seven days
buried alive under 20,000 pounds of dirt.

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:07.607
This is the scariest thing
I have ever done.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.643
All right, well, I guess
it's time, bury me alive.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.748
That was scary.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.349
This is going to be terrifying.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.752
This is pretty much most people's
worst fear.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.421
Oh, my God. That dirt is terrifying.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.323
Brace yourself. Ha ha ha.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.158
Drop the payload.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:25.759
Oh, God.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.560
I feel like
I need to hold the roof.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.531
My roof is shaking.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:36.069
I'm entrusting my life to this
coffin for the next seven days.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.405
Let's pray it doesn't
just randomly decide to break.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.040
And obviously,
this goes without saying.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.409
But yes, this is 100% real.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.243
And I'll be honest,

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:46.146
I severely underestimated
how hard this was going to be.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.382
And with that, the challenge
has officially started.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.619
I am now trapped in here
for the next seven days.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.489
It took the boys so long to bury me
alive that I already have to pee.

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:57.957
And the challenge just started.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:00.427
In case you're wondering
how I use the bathroom down here.

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.063
Well, yeah.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.264
This is so uncomfortable.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.499
All I have to survive
the next seven days...

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.567
My foot!

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.469
is the food in this briefcase,

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.005
which is basically
just some MREs and snacks.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:13.940
My foot went numb.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:15.775
Five gallon
drum of water over there.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.745
And whatever essentials
the boys put in this briefcase,

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.680
which probably means I'm
going to run out of food way

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.681
before the seven day
mark.

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:22.749
In all seriousness.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.951
This is extremely dangerous.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.319
And so I don't suffocate.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.755
I need to make sure
people are watching me at all times.

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:29.789
Jimmy, can you hear this?

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:34.060
Yeah, it sounds like Nolan's
mom is jumping on the surface.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.896
If we had 12 people,
maybe it would be that.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:38.631
It's almost 1 a.m.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.700
I have a feeling a lot of you
are going to start going to bed.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.503
I need someone to be near
a walkie at all times.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.272
So if I need something,
I actually need one of you to answer, okay?

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.543
And now that I have
nothing better to do

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:53.446
I'm going to head to bed,
and I'm either going to wake up

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:56.616
well rested
or crushed by 20,000 pounds of dirt.

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.551
Hopefully I wake up well-rested.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.087
Sleep is going to be key
to finishing this challenge,

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.255
because when I'm asleep,

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:05.358
I'm not thinking about the fact
that I'm trapped in this box.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.161
But that
only works most of the time.

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.197
Is there a fly in here?

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:14.167
The goal is to sleep as much
through this challenge as possible.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.035
For my own sanity.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.538
Oh, look at him.

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.373
He looks so cozy.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.042
Jimmy Jam!

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:26.045
No.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.714
Nolan drew all over your face.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.216
Nolan, how many hours
till your mom comes to set?

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.918
No, I know you're going to say something.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.120
Hopefully she doesn't
actually crush the coffin.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:35.989
Show him.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.893
My strategy during this video
was to sleep the entire time.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.161
I completely forgot, though.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.363
My friends are going to annoy me
and not let me sleep.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.697
This is going to be miserable.

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:48.134
I want to start today off by turning
these long pants into shorts.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.207
I just punched that box.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:56.876
Mission one complete.
Your boy has shorts.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.545
This is our food briefcase.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:00.079
Let's give this MRE a try.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.448
MRE stands for "Meal
Ready to Eat".

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:05.885
All you have to do is add hot water,
and it chemically cooks the food.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.720
The boys, on the other hand,
we're grilling up

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.490
steaks and literally
feasting on top of my grave.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:11.791
You know, Jimmy, just for you,

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.127
we're going to eat MREs
for the rest of the time we're out here.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.461
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:16.429
No.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:18.464
I literally heard Tareq
in the background saying no.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:22.135
Enjoy your hot water pasta in a bag.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:24.204
Meanwhile, this is my reality.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:25.371
Oh, it's crunchy.

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.073
Why is pasta crunchy?

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.809
This is...
This is great.

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:33.713
I was so bored, I actually ended up
punching my coffin for fun

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.481
until my knuckles started to hurt.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:38.384
So I put a sock on my hand
so I could keep punching the wall.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.420
I'm desperate for entertainment.

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.021
Oh, Jimmy.

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:43.723
Thank God I'm so bored.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:45.325
One second.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.928
What did you do?

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.564
Yo, that actually scared me.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:53.766
Can you at least semi
explain to me what you're doing?

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.335
Seeing how my life is on the line?

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:56.336
All right.

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:00.406
Unfortunately, the boys are
incapable of explaining anything.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.041
What they've done
is they've stuck a pipe

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:04.911
all the way down to my grave,
vacuumed the dirt out of it,

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:07.213
just to take this surgical wire camera

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:09.082
and feed it
down and look at me suffer.

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.251
Yeah, that's what happens.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:11.918
That's what happens.

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:12.952
It's time to go in.

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.488
This is so surgical.

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:16.522
What is that?

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:20.159
Oh, that fly on my leg freaked me out.

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.094
Get away from me.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.428
You want to hold this steady?

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:23.196
Just keep looking.

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:25.798
- Move your...
- We see him.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:26.833
Having fun?

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.635
Good night, Jimmy.

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.603
And when day two
was coming to a close,

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:33.072
the boys left me to go
spend time by their RV.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:35.408
And being the under stimulated man.
I was.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.411
I thought it'd be a good time
to crack into their essentials briefcase,

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.946
 and see what was inside.

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:44.984
Wait, he's opening the card.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.323
Is this Nolan's mom?

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:51.858
I found a photo of your mom.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.226
Bro...

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.130
- Did you do that?
- No, that was not me.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.564
Nolan, is this your mom?

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.734
Oh, my God. She's on his chest.

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:03.836
Oh, my God.

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:06.439
Besides, somehow
losing this picture, if I had to

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.708
guess what I think
would make me quit this challenge,

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.643
it would be not wanting to poop
underground.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:13.212
Back pain, back pain, back pain.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:14.747
And maybe some back pain.

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.015
And obviously, you can tell

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:17.950
this is already
getting pretty hard for me.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.220
But like usual, you better bet
it's going to get a whole lot worse.

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:22.655
It's raining really heavy right now.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:25.558
I just woke up to the sound
of thunder. Nolan, wake up.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:28.227
We got to check on Jimmy,
make sure he's, like, not crushed.

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:29.462
I'm actually kind of concerned.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.265
This looks way more funeral-esque.

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:33.499
You think that dirt's heavier now?

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:34.967
Dirt plus rain is heavy.

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.070
Jimmy

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:41.074
I think I have an idea
of how to wake him up.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.491
Is someone drilling?

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:02.028
It's one of those days.

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:07.233
I don't even have
my pants on yet.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:09.235
And things are already getting
crazy.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.941
Jimmy, can you hear us?

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.075
What are you doing up there?

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:19.379
There are currently 15
speakers on top of your grave.

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:22.582
So if I had to guess,
Kris is about to play stupid music.

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.517
Jimmy, it's a party up here.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.585
Oh, my...

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:26.853
Whoa!

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:29.088
Yo, my coffin's actually shaking.

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:31.157
Jimmy, there's an earthquake, oh my God.

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:32.158
Wait, what is that?

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:34.527
I just noticed there's
an unscrewed bolt

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:35.695
on the side of my coffin.

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:37.397
His screw's came loose in the coffin.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.164
From the base?

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.565
- Are you kidding?
- Literally from the base.

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:42.235
Should I be concerned
this wasn't screwed all the way in.

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:43.703
Max it out.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.106
What the
heck are you doing right now?

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.274
I'm vibrating.

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:50.810
These vibrations
are kind of hurting my head.

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:53.246
Why is there flowers in my hair?
I'm freaking out.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.681
Okay, let's go dig a tunnel.

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.216
We're going to start the tunnel
right here

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:59.252
and dig all the way into Jimmy's
coffin.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:02.422
We have the speakers blaring noise
so that he doesn't hear us digging.

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:03.556
I've got an idea.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:06.726
We'll play construction
noises over the speakers.

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:09.028
So that way
he doesn't hear the excavator.

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:12.031
There's a loud noise, and no one's
answering over the walkie.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.566
So either I'm about to die.

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:14.934
It's like playing a video game.

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.335
Or they're about to do something dumb.

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.538
Except for you could accidentally
kill somebody.

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:23.943
I've officially crossed the 50 hour
mark.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.246
I have now been buried longer than
I was last time I did this challenge.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.581
I promised my doctor

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:31.284
that I would move every day
so I don't get blood clots

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:34.454
cause apparently lay down
for seven days straight can kill you.

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:35.788
I'm digging a hole.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.223
We got to loosen up the dirt for Kris.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:40.626
I asked the boys to pack dumbbells
and they gave me 3 pound dumbbells.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.896
I smell so bad.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.435
Yeah, I'm going to do
my best not to think about the fact

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:50.403
that I could die

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:51.971
when I stand up and a couple of days.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.507
Kris, go a few feet deeper.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.776
I'm not certified to do this at all.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:08:02.315
I am bored in a coffin.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.921
We definitely stayed up all night

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:11.791
and dug this tunnel
and didn't pay that guy to do it.

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:13.726
Is this safe?

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.328
- I'm going second.
- What's that?

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:16.796
And then you bring up the rear Tareq.

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:17.530
What is that?

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.798
You guys come right behind me.

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:20.733
One of the weird parts
about this challenge

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:24.470
is there's so many cameras
always reporting at all times.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.606
We should dig a couple more inches
and then we're to the coffin.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.407
It didn't really bother me
the first few days,

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:30.309
but I just have this weird feeling

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:32.778
someone's always staring at me
and it's starting to, like, kind of...

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:33.713
irritate me.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.715
Oh, there he is, there he is.

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.784
- We almost got him.
- What is that sound I hear?

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:39.652
Hi, Jimmy.

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:40.820
What?

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.989
- Hi Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.423
Hey, Jimmy,
do you see us?

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:46.158
I see Nolan's forehead.

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:47.393
Yeah, it's hard to miss.

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.262
How long did it take to dig
that tunnel?

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:50.630
Literally all night, Jimmy.

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:52.865
This is not what I
was expecting to happen today.

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:55.268
Hey Nolan one second.
What do you think of that photo?

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:58.004
What do I have to do to get
rid of that picture of my mom?

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.839
This is the only thing
keeping me sane.

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:02.675
- How do I get it back?
- I'm framing this and keeping it forever.

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:03.276
I'm sorry.

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.011
You've been in this coffin for so long

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.113
that you forgot about
what happened to the channel.

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:07.947
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.282
We're almost at 200 million.

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:12.051
You're going to hit 200 million
subscribers in that coffin.

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:14.053
Wish I could see it live.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.855
Me too my friend.

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:19.659
Nolan has a surprise
for you as well.

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.894
We're going to tape this Feastables
bar to Jimmy.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:22.995
Oh, my God, it's hot down here.

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:24.463
Is that the new Feastables bar?

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:27.433
Hey, this is actually pretty good
marketing by my friends

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.969
now in every time-lapse,
Feastables will be there.

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:33.773
I hope tomorrow's easier.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.911
It's a weird feeling, I am very tired,
but for some reason I can't sleep.

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:41.314
I don't know.
I've never had this happen before.

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:42.181
Why am I crying?

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.549
I don't know.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:46.852
Okay.

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:48.554
It's officially day five.

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:50.723
Only two more days
in this nightmare.

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:53.793
I don't think humans are meant
to lay down for five days straight.

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:55.962
I'll try to act like
I'm not depressed.

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:57.163
Almost there!

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:02.735
Jimmy, we got paintball guns, and
we're going to shoot your tombstone.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.236
That sounds fun.
Can I join?

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.611
I don't even know what to say
to them.

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:13.245
Jimmy, what have you been doing for fun?

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:15.481
Nothing.
I'm in mental agony.

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:16.482
Have you pooped yet?

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:18.985
I have to poop really badly,
but I'm going to see

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:20.820
if I can hold it in
for the next two days.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.056
I don't know why, but I have, like,
no motivation to do anything.

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:27.126
I've been laying here for five days
and I don't even have enough energy

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:28.127
to prepare a meal

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:30.496
because going to the bathroom down
here is so difficult.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:34.367
Don't ask me how, but I accidentally
got some pee on my shorts.

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:37.770
I'm cutting off the part
of my shorts that are infected.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.772
Sorry for how short they are now.

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:41.607
That was disgusting.

00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:43.109
Jimmy, we're here to celebrate.

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:45.211
We're almost at 200 million subs.

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.580
Well, what's the estimate of
when we hit it? How long?

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.881
I'm not a rocket scientist.

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:49.982
What does he want from us?

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.817
I've been feeling pretty terrible
all day

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:54.787
for the fact that we're about to hit
200 million subscribers.

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.389
Actually makes me kind of happy.

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:59.525
You know, since we're about to hit
200 million subscribers,

00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:01.460
this would be a super convenient
time to talk

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.795
about Verizon home Internet.

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.196
That's a good point.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.966
Verizon 5G home Internet is exactly
what it sounds like.

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:09.235
It's wireless Internet for your home
that runs off

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:12.972
Verizon's extremely fast 5G
ultra wideband network.

00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:15.074
And don’t ask me how,
but the gang hacked it

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:17.076
to make sure it worked
while I’m underground.

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:18.911
We're turning it on now.

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:20.379
Nice.

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:21.347
Okay, I'm connected.

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.315
And now you're going to watch us
hit 200 million.

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:24.984
And just by plugging
in this little box,

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:27.186
thanks to Verizon,
I now have reliable

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:28.320
5G home Internet.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.455
And because of our hack.

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:31.924
It actually works. Even though I'm
ten feet underground.

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:33.926
I can see my real time
subscriber count.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:37.229
Karl, did you know that if the people
watching this video are over 18,

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.899
while supplies last when they order
Verizon home internet

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:43.002
Verizon will give you an Xbox
series S on them.

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:44.336
They must hate money.

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:45.471
I mean honestly. Yeah.

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:48.040
And you can get it for as low
as $35 a month.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.409
So if you want a fast 
and reliable internet,

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:52.978
just go to mrbeastverizon.com
and put in your address

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:54.980
and it'll tell you
if it's available in your area.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.184
And now let's focus on the 200
million subscriber goal.

00:11:58.284 --> 00:11:59.618
We are so close.

00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:02.555
Before this I was just some
random dude in Nebraska and...

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:04.623
Now he's just some random dude
to North Carolina.

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:07.660
I used to be
just a random guy in Nebraska.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.296
Karl, this is a heartfelt moment.
Don't copy Nolan.

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:12.932
It's crazy that we used to like
talk about this

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:16.769
sitting at a lunch table and now
we're at 200 million subscribers.

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:17.703
That's insane.

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:20.139
I just want to say it's
been an honor working with everyone.

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:21.440
Let's crush some more goals.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.342
And finally,
Chandler, close this off.

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:25.177
I first started working
here, it was like seven of us,

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:26.045
and I was the janitor,

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:28.914
and now we're at 200 million subs
and I'm very grateful.

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:30.549
I started making videos
when I was 11.

00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:33.085
I'm 25 now
and I never in a million years

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:34.520
thought the channel
would get this big.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.622
I mean, as we're about to hit
200 million subscribers,

00:12:36.622 --> 00:12:38.591
I just want all of you to know
that I appreciate

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.559
every single one of you
to watch my videos.

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:42.695
I still remember the days
when I would make videos

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:45.464
and literally get zero views.
Thank you so much.

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:47.333
We're going to see all these numbers
move.

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:51.704
- Oh, my God!
- We did it.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:52.838
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:53.672
We did it!

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:58.277
Oh, I think it's unfortunately
time that we unplug, you know

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.078
Wait, hold on.

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:01.213
I haven't even got a chance
to call my girlfriend yet.

00:13:01.213 --> 00:13:02.648
Yeah, we got you.
We got you for sure.

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:04.183
All right bro, we're
going to be right here.

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:05.384
Okay?
You just finish that call.

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:06.952
Oh, come on, plug it back in.

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:09.188
I just want to say, like,
just 2 minutes.

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:10.756
So my girlfriend knows I'm alive.

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:13.859
- Let's go eat.
- All right.

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:21.734
I don't know.

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:23.903
I'm doing this thing where I'm crying

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:26.038
and I'm not 100% sure
why I'm crying.

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:28.274
Hitting
200 million with the boys was fun,

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:32.745
but now I'm just alone
and trapped in here again.

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:35.114
It's been five days.

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:38.017
Five days alone in this coffin.

00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:41.187
I honestly have no idea
how I'm going to survive

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:42.688
two more days of this.

00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:44.723
I'm going downhill quickly.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.725
Yo, Jimmy, how you doing?

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:49.028
Oh, no response.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:49.962
I don't know if he's alive.

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:53.399
Nolan I appreciate you
checking in on me and caring, but...

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.567
Are you actually hanging in there?

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:55.568
I know...

00:13:56.802 --> 00:13:58.637
Jimmy went from being terrified

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:01.607
to an absolute yapster,
and now he's a sad boy.

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:04.577
I'm doing my best
to talk to you guys for content, but

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.847
to be honest,
I have, like, zero desire to speak.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.849
I just want to get out of here.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.183
Yeah, he's losing his mind.

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:12.952
I think we need to find a way
to cheer him up.

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:14.220
So I'm going to make
some phone calls.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.588
I don't know
if I've told you guys this,

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.423
but I've already used up all my pee

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:19.391
bottles, and so basically,
whenever I have to pee,

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:22.361
I eat one of these meals,
and then I just pee in this bag

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:23.362
and zip it up.

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:25.497
I know
that might be too much information.

00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:27.533
This challenge is disgusting
and I want to leave.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:30.502
I was so down bad
that there was only one thing

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:33.172
in this world
that could possibly cheer me up

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:34.673
Jimmy, I brought somebody.

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:36.242
Who'd you bring?

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:37.710
My parents.

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:41.347
How's it going?

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:46.986
Well, have you talked about Nolan's
mom at all since you've been down there?

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.522
No, not whatsoever.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.291
And the picture?

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:54.293
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.930
More importantly, do you guys
have something super embarrassing

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.031
you could tell us about Nolan?

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.000
Jimmy, there's so many.

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:03.135
That will instantly
make this challenge so much better.

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:06.171
He told us he was going to prom,
but he actually just

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:08.774
went to the neighbors next door
for a little bit.

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:12.111
We like to see him
bring a girl home for Christmas.

00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:13.679
That's all.
I needed to cheer me up

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:16.382
because I know the comment section
is going to go crazy.

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:18.684
I hate Jimmy.

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:20.686
My mom has one more question.

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:21.687
Hit me.

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:24.757
All right, now you walk away.
That's how it works.

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:27.393
Did he throw the walkie again?

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:33.399
I know all of you like to sleep in
and you don't like getting up early.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:34.366
I don't care.

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:37.703
In exactly 12 hours,
I need you all to start digging.

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:38.504
Okay?

00:15:38.704 --> 00:15:39.672
That's kind of early, right?

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:40.639
What time is it?

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:43.242
As long as we wake up for
our alarms, we'll be good.

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:45.077
What would you do
if when I stand up,

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:47.112
I get blood clots
and just die on the spot?

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:48.347
I'd know where to put you.

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.684
See you in 12 hours.

00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:52.584
It's a date.

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:53.719
I'm about to go to bed,

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:54.920
and hopefully when I open

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.991
these eyes in the morning, someone
is digging me out of this coffin.

00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:01.260
So I don't know why I'm tearing up.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.762
I don't think I've ever been
more excited for anything

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:05.130
in my entire life.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.866
I can't wait to see the sunlight
tomorrow.

00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:09.501
I'll see you guys in the morning

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:10.936
This is going to be awesome.

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:12.571
Laying down for my final night.

00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:14.273
All I can think about
is whether or not

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:16.141
I'd be able to stand
when this is over.

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:19.378
It's not normal to be laying down
and not moving this long.

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:23.015
Boys.

00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:25.117
It is officially been seven days.

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:26.251
Yeah,

00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:29.989
I know you guys don't like doing
manual labor, but can you dig me up?

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.457
We're getting you out, Jimmy.

00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:33.659
This is the worst
part of the challenge.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:37.096
Because I'm just waiting
for my stupid friends to dig me up.

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.664
And of course, there's
the added tension

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:41.300
of whether or not
I'm going to die when I stand up.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.434
So, yeah.

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:44.103
Bring in the excavator.

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:47.006
I bet you when I get out, the first thing
they're going to say is how bad I smell.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.043
this Santa Claus looking guy
is going to bring you out now.

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:52.678
Karl,
I don't care what he looks like.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:54.446
Just get me out of this coffin.

00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:57.649
Dig, dig, dig, dig.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:00.886
Any second now this dirt above me
will turn into sunlight.

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:02.021
I can't wait.

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:06.792
Oh, that's the excavator.

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:07.793
Oh, that's scary.

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.099
I can see sunlight.

00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:15.267
Jimmy.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.935
Hey.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.904
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:20.773
How's it going?

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:24.076
It's hard to describe
what the sun looks like after

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:26.045
not seeing it for seven days
straight.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.212
Oh, my gosh.

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:28.914
I started crying once again.

00:17:28.914 --> 00:17:31.383
I'm not sure why.
I just couldn't help it.

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:32.551
We did it.

00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:33.786
We did it.

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:35.054
The only question that remains

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:39.058
now is when I stand up,
am I going to die of blood clots?

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.526
We'll find out in
just a minute.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.627
Jimmy, you ready?

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:43.929
Don't drop it on me.

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:45.831
I bet it stinks in there.

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:47.032
You guys are predictable.

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:48.734
I said that's what you would say.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:49.768
Well, let's not celebrate

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:51.537
until I stand up
and don't die of blood clots.

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:52.805
At least sit up for a second.

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:53.839
But wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:55.240
Wait for a medic to come down.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.209
Do you feel nauseous at all?
dizzy?

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:58.377
Oh, I don't know.

00:17:58.377 --> 00:17:59.978
That's good enough for me,
come on up, Jimmy.

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:01.880
This is my first time
standing in a week.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.382
Oh, my God. My legs are weak.

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.217
- Oh, I didn't die.
- Yeah! Time to go.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:05.818
All good!

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:07.920
I do feel like a rush of blood to
my head though.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.956
It's is actually a crazy feeling,
but the real surprise

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.891
was waiting for me
just above ground.

00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:14.693
Oh, wow there's so many people.

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:16.028
After seven days.

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:21.266
I was finally able to celebrate 200
million subscribers, the right way.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.368
We have to celebrate 200 million, bro.

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:27.106
Now that you all saw my underwear,
I'm going to end the video.

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:30.342
And as always, let's end with an explosion.
