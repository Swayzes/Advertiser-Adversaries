00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.136
I just
bought this entire grocery store,

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:07.273
which includes enough food
to literally feed an entire city.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.443
And then I decided to trap
this random guy inside.

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:15.081
And every day you live here, I will
give you $10,000 in a grocery cart.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.983
That's wild, dude. Let's go.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.785
- Well I'll give it to you in 24 hours.
- Okay.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:22.188
This challenge could literally
make Alex a multimillionaire,

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.958
which in theory means
he could be in here for years.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.559
And it starts right now.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.627
All right, Jimmy's gone.

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:30.063
Why would I ever leave?
I could be here for years.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.798
Time to go grocery
shopping, baby.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.633
Now, if Alex crosses this red line,

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.903
that we painted around the entire
perimeter of the grocery store.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:39.372
The challenge is over, and he walks
away with his current winnings.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.141
And to make sure
he stays inside.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.777
It's worth noting here
that we have countless cameras

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.012
covering every square
inch of the grocery store.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:48.748
For my first meal on night one,
I guess I'll cook this steak.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:50.417
I think this is
just going to be home base.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.986
This little
corner of the grocery store.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.189
If I have meals like this every night,
I'll easily be here for years.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.691
Day one, complete. See you in the morning.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.594
It is officially been 24 hours,
and I got the first 10 grand.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.029
- Alex.
- Hey.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.331
Can you feel this and confirm it's $10,000?

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.234
It is.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:08.835
I believe you.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.171
Now, we introduced the twist
of the challenge.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.706
Basically,
to receive the daily $10,000

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:16.709
you need to give me $10,000
in product from the store.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.913
And so you have to strategize
 what order to get rid of these items

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.781
to stay here as long as possible.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:23.416
Okay.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.418
Conveniently,
there's a lot of electronics over there

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.619
that are pretty
expensive for day one.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.821
That's probably a good idea.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.590
I can't really eat a TV,
so it's no use to me.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.159
You're $0.22 over.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.727
All right, let me check out.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.296
- Do you have an MVP card?
- No.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.297
- Would you like one?
- No.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:38.832
- Do you want to sign up for it?
- No.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:39.732
Here's your cash.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:40.900
Kris, take it away.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.605
I will see you tomorrow
with another $10,000 in cash.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.407
You should start strategizing
what you're going to sell me.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:48.441
This changes everything.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.410
I got to start strategizing for the future.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.580
I have to figure out all of
the stuff that I need to get rid of.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.248
Pet food, pet items.

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:58.318
Jimmy cannot pay me
to eat this stuff, I swear.

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.087
I got $10,000
worth of dog food right here.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.156
I think I'm just going to get some rest,
wake up early...

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.525
because I'm going to have to prep
more items tomorrow.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.293
I got a lot of work ahead of me.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.266
- Alex.
- What's up Jimmy?

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.601
Is that what you're selling to me
today?

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.369
Today it's dog food.

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.638
Oh, my gosh.
It's going to take us forever to move.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.073
Wait, can we do like a...

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.308
I let him clap.
Transition, go for it.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:25.245
There we go.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.947
It's all over here at the register.
Isn't that a cool effect?

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.015
I love Beast magic.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.684
We're at $9,991.80,

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:36.456
And for the final item,
we are now at $10,045.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:37.590
And something you should know.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.425
Every single item Alex sells to me,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:40.927
we're literally going to donate
to charity.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.695
So don't worry, none of
this is going to go to waste.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.864
The next few days
were kind of a breeze for Alex.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:47.867
On day five,
he sold me $10,000 worth of produce.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.837
All this produce here,
they're going to go bad very fast.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.839
On day six, he sold me a bunch of diapers.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.541
And on days seven, eight and nine,

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:57.644
he cleared out an additional
$30,000 worth of products.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.779
He even discovered
the backroom of the store,

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.814
and since he hasn't showered in 10 days,

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.850
he built his very own makeshift shower...

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.119
and laundry system.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.656
- Hey, how's it going?
- What's up, Jimmy?

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.724
All right,
as of now, give me an honest answer.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.259
How far do you think
you're going to go?

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.828
Oh, I mean,
I feel like 100 days for sure.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:16.462
Oh, boy.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:18.064
Depending on how long Alex lasts,

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.967
this may just become
my most expensive video ever,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.835
but I'm prepared for that.

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.972
Holy crap, dude.

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.907
I don't care if you go a year,
I got the money.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.143
Who put all this in here,
is what I want to know?

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:30.877
The bank.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.880
You will get this once
I get my $10,000 in items.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.916
All right,
today I have more TVs.

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.586
Who goes to a grocery store
to buy a TV?

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:40.687
Why are these here?

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:41.988
Now, Alex, be honest with me.

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:43.723
Did you empty out
any of these TV boxes,

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.124
fill them with rocks and keep the TV?

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.561
Dogs.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:50.863
All right. I trust him.

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:52.665
Even though
that was not what I was asking.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.971
Approaching day 11,

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.907
Alex began to get pretty efficient
at picking which items to sell.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.676
$10,001.89.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:07.614
And since I had to leave to go film a video
where I stranded myself on an island...

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.915
This is not comfortable.

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:11.751
But let's pray we get like
30 minutes of sleep tonight.

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.087
We had someone else
drop off the money for Alex.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.521
We call him "The Money Man".

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.790
It's "The Money Man".

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:19.759
Thank you, sir.

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.294
$100,000.

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:23.162
I can definitely reach a million.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.864
And what he did
with the rest of his time

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:27.533
to keep himself
entertained was interesting.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:29.769
I am building a cheeseball wall.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:31.804
It's done.

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:34.107
The great wall of cheese balls.

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:37.810
Oh, yeah baby.
Here we go.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.479
Three, two, one...

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.084
It was worth it.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.686
It was so worth it.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.088
On day 13,

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.658
Alex decided to upgrade
his shower because...

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:53.226
It's a piece of crap.

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:55.161
What I'm going to do,

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:59.165
is use four of these shelves
to reinforce the shower.

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:00.366
Okay, here we go.

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:12.745
I am going to use plastic liner,
drape it across here.

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:15.148
The walls are waterproof now.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.516
All right,
You got to give it to him.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:19.719
This man is literally constructing
a functioning shower

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.821
out of just raw store parts.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.690
And there it is.
Shower's done.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.024
Time to test it.

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:31.664
Okay.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.132
It's been a few days in here.

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.167
I'm going to build a wall.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.435
Now, I never thought I'd see this,

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:37.970
but Alex literally used
all the water bottles

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.672
in the entire store to build walls

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.174
for his makeshift shelter.

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:43.743
He even created a bed
using all of the toilet paper

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.511
and it looked kind of comfortable.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:47.480
This is pretty cozy.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.148
I could fall asleep right here.

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:56.656
I got to get to scan in,

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.625
kind of had my eyes
on these bad boys for a while.

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:02.261
Gift cards.
These things are freaking expensive.

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:05.398
It is actually surprising
how expensive birthday cards are.

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:09.802
Because Alex was able to hit his
$10,000 mark only using the cards.

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:11.804
And after I got back
from filming at the island...

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.506
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey, it's been a while.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.909
Alex wanted to see if we could help him
use the forklift in the back of the store.

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:19.479
You know, if you could get it in
the store, that'd be super helpful.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.447
You're sure you're going
to let Kris drive this?

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:21.848
Yeah.

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.349
Three, two...

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:26.652
Alright.

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:27.920
Not the bakery.

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.789
I think maybe one more.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.793
Yeah.

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:36.863
Hey, it's in.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.231
Yes!

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:40.133
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:41.067
Enjoy your forklift.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.268
We'll see you tomorrow.

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:44.871
Even though it's only been a day
since he last saw me,

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:47.440
it seemed like Alex
really started to miss me.

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:50.443
At least that's the only explanation
I have for what he's about to do.

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:52.512
I saw this
cut out of Jimmy over here.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.580
We're going to be hanging out a lot,
you and I.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.083
He's just going to watch,
make sure I don't lose count.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.520
Just scanning away for another 10k.

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:03.423
$10,000.33

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:04.524
Over the next few days,

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:06.592
Alex's efficiency was through
the roof,

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:07.760
thanks to his new forklift.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.929
So he even had enough time
to upgrade his bed.

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:11.531
and it was quite the improvement.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.699
It's is so much better.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:17.069
And even though Alex's original goal
was to get a million dollars...

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.871
I think we're going
for a mil on this one.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:21.641
I hope not. He started documenting
what he'd spend the money on

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:25.144
and came to realize maybe he didn't
need to stay as long as he thought.

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:28.080
A million dollars is nice in theory.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.283
I'm still missing out
time with my boys.

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:33.186
Both their birthdays are coming up
in the next two months.

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:34.454
I've never missed a birthday yet.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.089
So after thinking about
what I want to put the money toward,

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:40.893
I realized that I need to
at least make $500,000.

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:43.362
But right now, I only have $200,000.

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.131
So in total, I got 50 days,

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.166
I got to be in here
almost halfway there.

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:51.304
On day 22,
Alex decided to absolutely decimate

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.738
all the goldfish in the grocery
store.

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:53.873
Oh, my God.

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:58.377
Okay, so this is $10,000
worth of goldfish.

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.913
I could feed an army of toddlers.

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.048
All right.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:02.915
Thank you, sir.

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:05.384
You're living a regular life
now. Almost.

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:07.954
You're getting paid
ten grand a day to miss your family.

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.121
Yeah.

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.990
And you can just do this
however long you want.

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:11.858
Yeah.

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:13.793
And you can just do this
however long you want.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.261
However long you want.

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:17.063
However long you want.

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:22.902
As you can see, the days
started blending together for Alex.

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:26.372
But eventually, the day came
where he decided to sell the water

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:28.407
that he originally used for his shelter.

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.511
But since he couldn't
sell the empty shelves in the store,

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:33.880
he realized
they make pretty good walls.

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:37.483
I'm going to reinforce
the house with metal shelves.

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:43.890
This is the way.

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:52.431
As you can see, Alex is feeling
pretty at home now.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:55.434
But what he doesn't know is
when I bought this grocery store,

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:57.303
I stopped
paying the electricity bill.

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.639
So at any point now,
all the power's going to cut off

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:02.341
and his freezers won't work,
the lights won't work, and so much more.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.377
The challenge is going to get way harder.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:07.179
But to give them some motivation
before things get pretty crazy.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.948
We thought Alex deserved a reward.

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:10.783
- Are you excited to see your dad?
- Yes.

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:12.285
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah.

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.387
I think he might literally cry.
This is gonna be crazy.

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:17.723
Alex, we have a surprise for you.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.891
Hello.

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:21.193
- Oh, my babies!
- We brought some special guests

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.428
Hi buddy!

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:25.197
Yesterday, you were telling me about
how much you miss your family.

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:26.065
I felt kind of bad.

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.433
So to celebrate 30 days,

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:28.701
we're gonna
to let you spend the day with them.

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.104
What are you doing? You crazy boy.

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:34.273
Daddy, I need to go pee.

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.710
What's happening
with all the boxes on the floor?

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:39.078
I made a race car track.

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:40.746
- Is that the car?
- Yeah

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.148
Wait, can he ride that?

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.117
What do you think, dude?

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.020
There they are.

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:50.756
I can't believe that you guys are here.

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:51.857
I know.

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:54.160
- Dada.
- Come here.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.861
Today, I got to see Sarah and the boys.

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:57.163
It was freaking amazing.

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:59.098
And Sarah was as beautiful as ever.

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.300
- I love you.
- I love you.

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:03.302
- Bye.
- Bye buddy, I love you.

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:07.673
Heart break.

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:10.977
When I saw my kids,
I mean, they looked different to me,

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.011
you know at that age,

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:14.080
they grow weekly.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.516
I just look forward to going back
home, spending time with my family.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:22.421
What's up? I better get up
and start scanning stuff now.

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:24.023
We're gonna...

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:26.459
What the heck? Why are the lights off?

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:28.461
What are these shenanigans?

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.629
There's a flashlight.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.497
It's just some kind of joke?

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:33.532
Houston, we have a problem.

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:36.268
Did you do this, sir?

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:38.871
Knock, knock.

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:41.207
This is so much creepier.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.541
My power's out, Jimmy.

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:46.112
Yes, so when I bought this grocery store,
they gave me a form to put,

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:48.614
like, the utilities in my name,
and I just never filled it out.

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:52.451
The cameras and cash registers
are hooked up to a generator

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:55.087
because we need those.
So what am I looking at over here?

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:58.891
Okay, so I had originally $60,000
ready to go.

00:10:58.891 --> 00:10:59.659
Oh, my gosh.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.260
But I assumed
now that the power went out,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.962
You're going to sell the frozen
stuff...

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.263
Yeah. Things have changed.

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:05.464
We need to get to scan it.

00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:06.499
Let's get rid
of these hot meats.

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:07.299
Assembly line.

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:08.834
All right, I'll hold the cart.

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:09.602
Assembly line.

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:10.569
I'm the door holder.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:12.271
And while they're clearing out
the freezers,

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:13.973
I want to tell you guys
about Shopify.

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:15.841
Shopify
help pay for this grocery store.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.343
And in exchange,
wanted me to promote

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.612
one of the millions of businesses
they support in power.

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:22.548
If only we had a bag that we could
put these things in to keep it cold.

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:24.450
And together we picked Kanga Coolers.

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:27.453
Chandler, what if I told you,
there's a 12 pack of soda inside of it?

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.923
And it can keep what's inside cold
for up to seven hours.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:33.559
That's a long time.

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:35.961
You got multi wieners.
You got single wieners.

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:37.229
- Cheesy.
- Cheesy wieners.

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:39.432
Kanga Coolers are
lightweight and insulated,

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:40.900
so you can take them wherever.

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:42.501
Hey, meet us at the front.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.869
Chandler, have you ever been
a cashier before?

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:46.072
- Yeah.
- Wait, did you double scan that? Hold up.

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:47.106
You can have the Kanga Cooler.

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:48.474
You can fit a
human head in here.

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:50.643
Anyways, click the link in the description,
download the shop app right now.

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:51.844
You can buy a Kanga Cooler.

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:53.512
I'm going to go help them
scan some meat.

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:55.414
All right, here's our meat receipt.

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:57.950
Here's your 10 grand.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.618
Also, here's a Kanga Cooler.

00:11:59.618 --> 00:12:00.319
Oh, nice.

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:02.555
Oh by the way Alex,
I’m going to Africa for a week

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:06.025
At this point, I once again had to
leave to go film a video in Africa

00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:07.493
where I built a hundred wells.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.562
Well number one is a success.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.097
Alex spend the rest of his day

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:13.933
rushing to get all the frozen
food sold so it can be donated.

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:16.902
Guess I'll just be scanning stuff
in the dark from now on.

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:19.438
I really hope Jimmy turns the power on.

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:20.473
It's going to suck.

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:21.373
I'm not going to lie.

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:25.077
Being left without power affected
Alex way more than I thought it would.

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:28.080
I guess the food wasn't
the only thing getting checked out.

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.321
I wonder if you can tip over a forklift?

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:40.359
Careful on aisle seven.

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:52.271
This store is turning into a wasteland.

00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:54.106
So I'm going to the back.

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:58.711
 I'm going to open up this dock door
and let some daylight hit my face,

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:02.615
breathe in some fresh air
because this is not going to do it.

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:06.619
It's so nice.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:10.523
This right here
will give me through the dark days.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.826
It is day 36.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:17.797
I got $360,000.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.098
Why stop now?

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:22.501
Got to keep loading these carts up.
Got a lot of food to get through.

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:25.404
Just carts and pools of money.

00:13:25.437 --> 00:13:26.539
And waiting,

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:28.274
waiting for the days to go by.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:33.345
The most exciting part of my day
is being this close to the red line.

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:39.151
I'm just a sad,
old miserable boy back here.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:43.956
Nothing's ever been sadder in my life,

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:47.393
except living in a grocery store.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.529
Coffee, food, and a lot of money.

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:52.464
I'm like way ahead on checkouts still.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:55.367
I don't want to do anything,
there's nothing to do.

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:59.171
All that stands between me,
my wife, my kids,

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.606
is this line right here.

00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:01.674
The lights being off,

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:05.611
being this close to the red line,
realizing I can go see my family.

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:07.780
It's super tempting every day now

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:12.251
I know there's
a bunch of pallets back there still

00:14:12.284 --> 00:14:13.786
that I haven't even dug into.

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:15.054
Some glasses.

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:16.622
Ice packs.

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:17.957
What the...

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:19.291
Look what I just found.

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:22.094
InstaStart QuickPack lantern.

00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:23.062
Nice.

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.296
I got five of them.

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:25.798
I just lit them all up.

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:27.566
They're on full blast right now.

00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:30.736
It definitely lights up
the entire space really well.

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:32.771
I feel like I can actually
hang out in here again.

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:36.642
Alex, are you here?

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:38.644
- Another 10k?
- Yeah

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:39.578
Let's go, dude.

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:41.280
It's crazy I have all this money.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.316
But there's nothing I can do
with this money while I'm in here.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.484
Except just look at it.

00:14:45.517 --> 00:14:47.786
Well, you can't look at it.
It's so dark in here.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.322
- So I'm going to bring some lights in.
- Are you serious?

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:51.390
For filming purposes.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.224
Alright.

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:53.859
What are you going to do for
the rest of the time you're in here?

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:56.028
Something I definitely want to do
is go ahead and just run

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:58.163
through all these shells
with the forklift.

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:05.504
You ask for this!

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:08.674
What is going on?

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:09.541
All right.

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:12.811
Time for me to not be here anymore.
We'll see you tomorrow.

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.480
Here's your broom.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.214
Thanks, guys.

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:16.382
Enjoy cleaning.

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:19.418
After spending an entire day
cleaning up Kris's mess,

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:22.421
Alex took advantage of the newly
opened space to set up a pool

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:23.255
he found in the back.

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:24.290
Off we go.

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:29.762
I'm going to drag the hose out here,
stick it in this pool,

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:33.799
and sometime tomorrow
we'll have a grocery swimming pool.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.634
It's been over a week, and Chandler

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:37.436
won't tell me what happened
while I was gone.

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.004
This place looks
completely different.

00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:40.973
Oh God, open the doors.
I got to see this.

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:43.242
Where did everything go?

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:45.644
We did a little remodeling
while you were gone.

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:48.580
This looks like someone gave Kris
a forklift. Everything makes sense now.

00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:50.849
- Can you show me the pool?
- Yeah, you want to get in?

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:52.551
Flip.

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:53.619
Do you wear socks?

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:54.186
Yeah.

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:55.487
That's crazy.

00:15:58.157 --> 00:15:59.124
It's freezing.

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:00.159
Cannonball.

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:02.928
What you typically do
in the pool?

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:06.098
I just kind of float around.

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:08.834
This was fun and all,
but I think we should check out.

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:11.036
Thanks for the groceries.
Enjoy your pool.

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:13.973
All right, I'm just going
to grab everything from the back

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:16.141
and just put it up
here, organize it.

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:17.743
And who knows?
Maybe there's some fun in there.

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:20.312
It's no secret at this point,
Alex was pretty tired,

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:22.982
and while he was making
his rounds in the forklift,

00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:24.883
something unexpected happened.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.318
Oh, crap.

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:28.620
No!

00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:30.522
No!

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:32.591
Oh God!

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:37.529
Dude!

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:40.299
No!

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:43.402
Oh my God.

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:46.405
I was trying to turn one way, and
it just went the opposite direction.

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:48.707
Oh, my God.

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:50.709
My freaking money is soaked.

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:52.444
There's a bunch of products ruined.

00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:54.880
It's, like, so deep right here.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.315
It's in my space.

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:58.050
It's all over the grocery store.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.085
Dude, I'm done, man.

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:01.487
I just want to leave.

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:03.956
We're going in.

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:05.758
- Alex!
- Buddy.

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:06.859
Why is it so wet in here?

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:07.860
Yeah.

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:09.862
Oh, Alex.

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.797
Your golden chariot awaits you.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.499
Look at you in bed.

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.234
- You good dog?
- I'm all right, man.

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:17.403
You look like a defeated man.

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:18.504
Yeah, I busted the pool.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:19.571
How does one bust a pool?

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:23.208
So I was driving by to drop off
some pallets, and I tried to turn,

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:26.245
and it just turned the complete
opposite way. I was like.

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:27.212
No!

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:28.080
So all this got wet?

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:29.448
How many more weeks
do you have left?

00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:30.649
Weeks?

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:32.751
I'm just taking it
day by day right now.

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.353
Depends how much longer I can go.

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:34.987
So if you just see

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:37.222
like a spider in your bed
tomorrow, you're leaving?

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.424
Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah.

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:40.492
I don't think he has many days left.

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:41.593
This is ending soon.

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:43.295
You guys want to come hang out
for a little bit?

00:17:43.495 --> 00:17:44.730
- Heck no.
- You're depressing.

00:17:44.763 --> 00:17:47.800
This is what the store looked like
when Alex started the challenge.

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:50.536
And this is what it looks like now.

00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:56.742
So day 44.

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:01.947
It's almost dark outside.

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:03.849
Jimmy hasn't come by today.

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:05.918
I have stuff I need to sell.

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:07.986
I'm just going to move
this stuff to the back.

00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:11.256
Hopefully somebody brings me
the $10,000 today.

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:13.392
Maybe they just forgot or something.

00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:17.463
It's really lonely in here.

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:20.199
I'm just going to

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:22.835
go sit in my chair
till they bring me some money.

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:32.010
Yo, what?

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:33.779
Are you serious?

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:38.550
Are you there, Jimmy?

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:43.455
It's the first interaction
I get all day, and it's...

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:45.724
the freaking robot.

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:48.894
Thanks for the money.

00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:58.871
Not even Jimmy
wants to come here for a minute.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.039
That's how depressing this place is now.

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:03.041
Can't say I blame him,
honestly.

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.711
This sucks, man.

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:30.736
God, I'm freaking miss my family
so bad.

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:32.404
It's day 45.

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:33.972
And Chandler,
how would you say he's doing?

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:36.842
That is complete boredom.
He's just tapping the bat on the ground.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:41.380
I would feel bad for him,
except he's won $450,000,

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.683
and he can leave whenever he wants,
so he'll be fine.

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:46.919
- Alex.
- Hey.

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:48.287
We were watching you on the cameras.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.588
You looked very sad.

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:51.690
Yeah, I'm pretty bored.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:52.925
Well, here's $10,000.

00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:55.127
- So are you less bored?
- Helps a little.

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:56.628
How many weeks left you got?

00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:58.497
Well, I don't even know
if I got an hour left, Jimmy.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.266
Really? Here, let's go look
at your sea of money over here.

00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:02.968
This is all the money
you've made so far.

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.203
450 grand.

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.771
Are you saying
you're content with it?

00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:08.040
Give me one second.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.375
I've got a surprise
that might help you decide.

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.711
What? Are you serious?

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:15.981
Hey babe.

00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:17.149
What the heck?

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:18.483
Don't cry.

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.053
I can't help it.

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:23.622
Okay.

00:20:23.655 --> 00:20:25.057
Why aren't you wearing your shoes?

00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:26.758
And your shirt?

00:20:26.758 --> 00:20:29.294
To be clear,
I didn't take his shoes.

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:30.862
I don't know why he's not wearing
shoes.

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:33.465
These are all the things that
this money's going to go toward.

00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:35.500
- Isn't this crazy?
- I can't even wrap my head around it.

00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:38.370
I feel like I could do another
five days.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.705
Do you think it's worth it?

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.307
What's the verdict?

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:44.243
- We've weighed the options.
- Make tons of money.

00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:45.844
Keep tons of money already made.

00:20:45.844 --> 00:20:48.747
Honestly, it's not worth staying
and I’m leaving.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.416
Okay, well,
then let's push the money out.

00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:59.391
All right, Alex, the second
you step on the red, it's over.

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:01.460
I can move all the money back.
We can keep going.

00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:02.694
It's your decision.

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:05.030
All right, bring it back in.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.265
Okay, bring it back in.

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:07.466
Just kidding.

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:10.569
Let's go!

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:15.374
Alex spent 45 days in the store
and walked away with $450,000.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.844
Can't believe this happened.
This is freaking sick.

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:20.512
Congratulations, Alex.

00:21:20.512 --> 00:21:22.414
Shout out to Albertsons for helping us
fill the shelves.

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:24.716
You guys are amazing.
 I'm going to go find him a shirt.

00:21:24.716 --> 00:21:26.418
Also, if you're wondering
how we filmed this video

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:27.919
because we blew up
the earth earlier,

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.655
it was actually on the moon
the entire time.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.523
Watch the laser
maze video if that's confusing.
