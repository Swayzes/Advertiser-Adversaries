00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(groovy electronic music)
(camera whirring)

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:13.376
(electronic buzzing)

00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:14.209
(switch clicks)

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.860
- So, one of the best
gaming phones on the planet

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.990
is going mainstream.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.207
Like, look at all the previous ROG Phones:

00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:24.900
ROG Phone 1, ROG Phone 2, ROG Phone 3...

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.490
Skipped 4 because 4 is bad luck.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.940
ROG Phone 5 ROG, Phone 6, and ROG Phone 7.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.150
Now, this one is the ROG Phone 8 Pro.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.330
This one is noticeably more regular.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.910
So ASUS still makes other regular phones,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.810
the Zenfone, and ROG still
stands for Republic of Gamers.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.120
This is very much still a gaming phone.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.270
But the thing that makes
gaming phones so good at gaming

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.030
also makes them really good at media

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.270
and just being all-around
really good daily drivers.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.197
So ASUS has finally said, "You know what?

00:00:56.197 --> 00:00:59.287
"What if we just package
our great gaming phone

00:00:59.287 --> 00:01:00.600
"for the masses?"

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.280
And I think this is the first one

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.920
where they've really
committed to that idea.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.920
Now, don't get me wrong, they
still pack in the gamer stuff.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.050
There's still a hidden display
on the back of the phone

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.710
and all kinds of crazy specs,
but the pivot is real here.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.590
So, given the fact that
it's still a gaming phone,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.260
we are not surprised that
it still turns up the specs

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.940
all the way to the bleeding edge

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.440
with this 6.78-inch 165
Hz AMOLED display up front

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.770
that gets to a crazy bright 2,500 nits.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.650
It's got a 3.3 gigahertz
Snapdragon 8 gen 3

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.300
with up to 24 gigs of LPDDR5X RAM

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.660
and a terabyte of UFS 4.0 fast storage.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.120
It smokes Geekbench.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.050
It just crushes 3DMark.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.630
It can play "Genshin Impact" at 60 FPS.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.760
Like, this phone is ridiculously fast.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.920
Also, opening and moving through apps

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.590
and just using it like
a normal phone is crazy.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.320
It's one of the snappiest
phones I've ever used.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.450
Taking photos is extremely quick

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.940
from the millisecond your finger
touches the shutter button.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.150
Even this optical fingerprint
reader underneath the glass

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.440
is surprisingly fast.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.300
It's just overall the fastest,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.820
like, the most reactive
phone I've ever used.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.520
So all that is great, and
we know it can handle games,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.110
but if you're ASUS,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.820
how do you now package this
as a great daily driver?

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.980
'Cause let's be honest,
the previous gaming phones

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.530
were just so gamery.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.700
So okay, first things first:

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.530
It's gotta be more one-handable.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.630
Like, yes, you still want
a huge display for gaming,

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.910
and gamers will spend a lot of
time with the phone sideways

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.430
and in two hands, but
regular phone stuff happens

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.200
vertically with one hand all the time.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.270
So they've shrunken the bezels

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.950
all the way around all the sides,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.230
and it's pretty noticeable
at the top and the bottom,

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.670
which is now looking on par

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.590
with other full-screen
flagships out there.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.400
And that does also mean it's
the first time in an ROG Phone

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.500
that they've ever had a hole punch camera.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.880
But it's also a pretty small hole punch,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.380
so it looks totally normal.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.600
And this also comes at the
expense of a little bit

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.610
of that front-facing speaker space.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.650
The speakers are still quite loud

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.260
and full-sounding stereo
front-facing speakers,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.680
but yeah, the fact is
they're slightly less insane

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.060
than last year.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.070
And then, they also went
and made the phone thinner.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.290
So they flattened out
the frame on the sides,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.820
again, similar to some other phones,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.980
so the whole thing is slightly more trim,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.950
cutting it under nine
millimeters for the first time.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.200
And it's still, honestly,
pretty well-balanced,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.430
even with this camera bump

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.750
that we'll talk about in a minute.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.900
But, of course, thinner
also means, you guessed it,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.270
slightly smaller battery,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.340
again, for the first time in an ROG Phone.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.050
It goes from 6,000 milliamp
hours to 5,500 milliamp hours.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.670
To be honest, in using this phone,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.230
I haven't really noticed the difference

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.790
because it's still such a battery champ

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.380
with all the optimizations

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.190
ASUS has pulled with the
software, with this display,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.110
but they did technically
make the battery smaller.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.000
So the result of all that
trimming and sculpting

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.610
is a phone that it's definitely still big,

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.850
but it's much closer to
a normal-sized phone.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.250
It's basically the same
size as my Pixel 8 Pro

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.500
that I've been dailying,
but it still has room

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.110
for the gamery, media-friendly features.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.050
Like, there's still a second
USB-C port on the side,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.900
so you can keep charging
while gaming in landscape.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.390
Still got the remappable shoulder triggers

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.830
and the rare headphone jack.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.880
And side note, I've been testing

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.440
a couple in-ear monitors lately

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.510
and just enjoying using
them in all kinds of places,

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.560
and this is one of the rare phones

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.900
that I can actually plug
it in and use it with.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.880
And ASUS throws in a surprising amount

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.290
of audio adjustment features

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.900
and a bunch of different
profiles and EQ settings

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.790
that you can play with
and make a big difference.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.500
And then, hey, if you're
gonna use this daily,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.440
people are gonna want the
confidence of water resistance.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.510
Like, real water resistance.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.477
Previous gaming phones don't
really focus on that too much.

00:04:36.477 --> 00:04:40.080
ROG Phone 7 was IP54, and that's nice,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.470
but this is the first ROG Phone
that stepped up to full IP68

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.670
water and dust resistance,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.200
which is sort of the gold standard

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.490
of not just getting rained on

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.100
but, like, you can spill
a drink on your phone

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.610
or drop it in the toilet and
actually be totally fine.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.063
Now, do we still think this
looks like a gaming phone?

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.570
Honestly, I think they've done a good job.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.500
It's a nice balance.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.420
Like, they've done a slow ramp

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.610
of toning it down a
little bit over the years

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.570
and less RGB and jagged
lines and screens on the back

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.500
and all that sort of stuff.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.640
Now, with this one,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.440
I think the camera bump
is the weirdest part,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.480
but aside from that, it's pretty subtle.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.950
Like, this one, it's a satin black,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.660
so it doesn't show any fingerprints.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.210
It's got a single diagonal glossy strip,

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.230
which definitely screams
or maybe whispers, "Gamer,"

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.970
but I don't mind it.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.920
And then I could probably
do without all the text:

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.570
The "Republic of Gamers" text

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.390
or the "Good luck, have fun"
text next to the USB-C port.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.040
But honestly, this is fine.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.390
It's super toned down.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.140
But what if I told you
there is still a display

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.553
on the back of this phone?

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.980
'Cause there is. They
couldn't help themselves.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.600
Like, you literally cannot tell

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.400
when the screen is off where it is.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.810
But if you go into the Armoury Crate

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.270
and turn on AniMe Vision...

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.340
I don't why it's called that.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.440
But the display then lights
up, it comes to life.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.350
It's this all-white LED dot matrix display

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.210
that can show all kinds of things,

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.210
from logos to charging status
to incoming call notifications

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.470
and notification counters, et cetera.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.720
Even when you're taking a picture,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.010
if there's a countdown timer,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.980
it'll do the countdown
on the outside screen.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.150
Or even when you're gaming,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.270
it'll just tell the world
that you're playing a game.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.810
It is definitely certifiably gimmicky,

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.850
but I like it anyway for a couple reasons:

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.460
One, it's still pretty minimal

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.293
on the back of the phone here.

00:06:27.293 --> 00:06:29.100
But two, it's actually functional.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.230
It's giving you real useful information

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.063
on the back of the phone.

00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:33.420
I would say even more
than the Nothing Phone.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.070
It's customizable, you can go through

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.530
and make special ones just
for whatever use case.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.410
And then when the screen is
off, you just can't even see it,

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.820
can't even tell it's there.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.670
And on top of all of
that, they even made room

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.330
for the first-ever wireless
charging in an ROG Phone.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.000
So these gaming phones have
always had so much chaos

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.650
going around on the back of the phone,

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.880
with these screens and lights,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.130
that they never had room
for wireless charging,

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.330
and that was totally fine

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.070
because gamers just weren't interested.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.640
But this time, they've
actually made the space for it.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.660
One thing I'll say though,

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.260
the coil is a little
higher up here than normal.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.060
It's above that little display.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.970
And so I think it's a little
higher than most other phones

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:12.803
'cause if I put the phone

00:07:12.803 --> 00:07:14.640
on a vertical wireless charger like this,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.160
it actually doesn't line
up, and it doesn't charge.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.940
But I discovered that if I turn
it sideways, it does charge.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.500
So you may have to play
with that a little bit.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.060
And, you know, lots of people
don't use wireless charging,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.040
and that's fine, but just
feels like this is something

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.410
you have to offer to be considered

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.710
one of the high-end versatile flagships.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.670
Even if you never use that,

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.400
there's still 65-watt wired charging

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.880
with the brick that is,
yes, included in the box.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.637
Now, in previous reviews,
I would literally say,

00:07:42.637 --> 00:07:46.747
"The camera, it's pretty
bad, but it's a gaming phone.

00:07:46.747 --> 00:07:47.887
"That's not one of the reasons

00:07:47.887 --> 00:07:49.530
"that you're buying this phone,"

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.030
and then, so it would just be fine.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.250
But in a phone that you want to package

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.190
and sell as a mainstream phone,

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.570
that goes from an afterthought

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.600
to literally one of the most
important pieces of this phone.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.280
So how did they do?

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.920
Well, this is an all-new camera
system for the ROG Phone.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.230
It's a 50-megapixel primary camera,

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.240
a 3x telephoto for the first time,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.130
and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.170
It's more hardware than before,

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.990
but I would say it somehow still feels

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.590
behind the Zenfone 10,
which is also made by ASUS.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.570
Like, are those branches of the company

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.100
even talking to each other? (laughs)

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.280
This primary camera sensor is an IMX890.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.310
It's the same camera sensor
that's in the OnePlus 11,

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.900
and the Nothing Phone 2,

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.050
and some other phones
in the $600-$700 range.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.130
And it produces pictures

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.350
that look kind of like those phones, too.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.240
They're decent sometimes in good light,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.520
but often a little too much motion blur

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.190
and a lot too much HDR.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.710
Seriously, sometimes, with
people as the subjects,

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.970
it looks like they're just trying

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.100
to blast the exposure on faces

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.360
and drag everything else down.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.460
It's just very aggressive processing.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.350
Like it's running
algorithms made for a sensor

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.030
from five years ago.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.350
Now, there are upsides,

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.450
like the super steady
video it's now capable of

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.200
thanks to the hybrid six-axis
gimbal, just like the Zenfone.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.750
It means you can shoot
slightly better handheld

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.480
in low light, but it's
really smooth video.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.700
And the front-facing
camera is wider angle,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.020
so you can fit more people in the frame,

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.210
even if it is still kind of HDR-ry.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.220
And the telephoto, that's something new

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.440
that the Zenfone also doesn't have,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.880
and that is genuinely useful.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.170
If you shoot a lot of zoom,

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.180
you know, 3x isn't the
most zoom in the world,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.360
but the stabilization
on it is so rock solid,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.040
so you can keep punching
it with digital zoom.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.080
All that's to say it's leveled up,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.971
but it's clearly still not
the focus of this phone.

00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:36.963
(chuckles) "Focus."

00:09:36.963 --> 00:09:39.150
But it's not the strength of this phone,

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.150
which might just be fine
in another $600-$700 phone.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.470
But as you may have picked up from my tone

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.360
and from the rest of
the specs in this video,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.793
this is not a $600-$700 phone.

00:09:49.793 --> 00:09:54.793
This is a very flagship phone
with a very flagship price.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.990
This ROG Phone starts at $1,100.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.870
And the spec that I'm reviewing,
with the 24 gigs of RAM

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.130
and the terabyte of storage,

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:10.130
this ROG Phone Pro is $1,500.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.360
Now, I also wanna point out

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.680
that you're gonna start
noticing AI features

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.950
with basically every phone
that comes out this year

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.390
with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.710
Like, this is one of the first ones.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:23.670
There's maybe one or two other

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.080
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 phones out.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.470
But Qualcomm has built
in new AI capabilities

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:32.280
into that chip, and oh,
boy, every manufacturer's

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.220
got some new AI stuff to
play with in their phone.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.540
So, for this gaming phone,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.920
they've built in some clever things

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.710
like pattern recognition inside of games

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.630
to fast forward through recognize scenes

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.100
in certain supported games

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.990
or even recognize what's on the screen

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.120
and prompt you to find a walkthrough

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.280
of the part of the game that you're in.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.990
Now, I found, you know, the smaller stuff

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.970
like the setting search more useful.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.530
It's got more semantic understanding.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.720
It can intelligently find the
setting you're looking for

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.710
based on what you write.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.710
So even if you type like "Two of one,"

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.187
it knows, "Oh, you're,
you're talking about

00:11:03.187 --> 00:11:04.417
"the Twin Apps feature

00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:06.307
"that lets you have multiple accounts open

00:11:06.307 --> 00:11:08.040
"for one app at the same time."

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.160
But in general, that's just
gonna be a theme of 2024

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.390
to look out for:

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.173
AI capabilities of phones with this chip.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.710
You can just trust me on this one.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.790
So the summary of the ROG
Phone (chuckles) is...

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.880
Look, this is still a
very capable, powerful,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.750
really fast Android
phone, like it always is,

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.880
and it's just a little more tame looking.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.150
Like, they've traded
some of their gamery edge

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.440
for mass appeal.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.510
And I think a lot of the
decisions were really smart.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.980
Like trading some of the basic
stuff like thinner bezels

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.370
and a little bit more of a
trim, like, overall form factor

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.080
and one or two millimeters of thickness

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.780
for a slightly smaller battery, fine.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.950
And I still think, you know,

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.770
getting the gamer stuff
with the display on the back

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.720
but still having wireless charging

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.000
and IP68 water resistance, that's great.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.430
But the one thing that they couldn't quite

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.150
get over that hump is the camera system.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.370
It's good, but it's not over that hump,

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.245
and that just happens to be one
of the most important things

00:12:11.245 --> 00:12:14.130
about a mainstream phone.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:19.130
And so this remains a
really good gamer phone.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.810
Thanks for watching.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.370
Catch you guys in the next one.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.203
Peace.
