00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:05.071
This is the most
insane laser obstacle ever created,

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.740
and this is just one of many

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.443
dangerous and extreme laser mazes
that we've built for this video.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.478
Whichever one of these

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:15.015
ten contestants
survives the longest wins 250 grand.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:16.249
Everyone, follow me.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.552
Welcome to room number one.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:20.920
You freaking kidding me?

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.923
Yo! How are we supposed
to get through this?

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:24.991
The rules are simple.

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.893
You need to go touch that
box of money.

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:30.463
But you touch a laser,
you lose $250,000.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:33.433
The billion dollar question
is, who's going first?

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.302
Oh, okay. We have our first go.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.571
What in the world, bros?

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.740
- I'm stressing out.
- Yeah.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.077
The craziest part is this is the
simplest of all the rooms we built.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.312
It gets so much harder after this.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.114
Okay.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.650
She's giving Number 1 no space
to work with over there.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.353
All right, y'all,
I got to get right there.

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:56.022
This might look like a game,
but it's very serious.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.992
This $250,000
cube of money is on the line.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.394
Okay, good, good, good, good, good.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.397
All right.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:08.768
It's coming towards you.

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:11.738
Oh my God.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.540
Oh my goodness.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.308
Hey...

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.277
No! Am I out?

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:18.945
Did I just...?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.815
Oh my God.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.583
Only nine remain.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:25.652
Oh, yes.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:26.920
You got it.
You got it.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.789
All right.
We got our first finisher.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.057
We got our second.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.226
I'm stuck.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:43.803
Where am I close? Where am I close?

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.107
- Let's go, baby.
- We in here!

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:49.876
That was surprisingly close.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.512
- Yeah.
- Let's go!

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.455
And by the way,
this video takes place in space

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.891
because in the last video,
we accidentally blow up

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:07.227
the entire planet.
And no, it's not CGI.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.461
This is 100% real.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.295
Stop asking me that.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.498
Turn on the lasers.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:15.401
A little overwhelming.

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:16.102
Very scared.

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:18.004
In order to complete this level,
each of you

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.807
will have to navigate this course
and then traverse this wall.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.343
All while the red laser walls
close in on you.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.644
Stay down the middle.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:27.580
And trust me when I say
this level is difficult, I mean it.

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:30.416
I tried it earlier and didn't
even get close to pass.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.218
Start level two.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.453
Okay, we're going.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.654
We're going.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.890
Oh, man, bro.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.558
Hey, move the wall faster.

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:41.294
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:44.030
What the hell is this?
This is super hard.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.867
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.403
Good job. Hurry.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.306
Go, go, go.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.213
That's cutting it close.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.481
I didn't even know we were starting.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.416
I thought he was just doing an intro
and everyone started moving.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:04.417
That was a little scary.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.219
I had to sprint through that,
it felt like...

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.121
Follow me to the next set.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.959
Now everyone here may look happy,
but I had something to tell them.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.627
Not all of you survived.

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.429
Someone actually hit the laser.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:17.530
I'll be back with the footage.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.698
Did anyone see it?

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.934
I don't think I touched the laser,
but I don't know.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.302
I just want to make it
to the next room.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.736
I was like the second one
to jump in the pit,

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.005
so I feel like I had enough space
and time.

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.006
I don't know. We'll see.

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.041
I didn't think I had it a laser.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.210
But if I'm the last person
and the walls are coming in

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.277
like it might be me.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.313
- My heart is just beating out my chest.
- Me too

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.080
I know.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.516
On this iPad,
we have who's been eliminated.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.350
I don't want to look.

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.718
All right, everyone,
huddle up, huddle up.

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:39.786
Oh gosh.

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:42.822
So here's culprit number one.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:43.389
It's me.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.025
It hit your shoulder,
then your back, then your butt.

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.328
It was actually impressive
how much you got hit by it.

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.697
If we all want to salute him as he leaves.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.131
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.600
It's been really an honor.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:57.270
Up next, if you look right here,
we zoom in on number eight.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.739
You'll notice he didn't get out.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.374
It was actually you.

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.176
Yeah.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.445
Oh my God.

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:07.380
I don't know why you all are sad.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.615
Five remain.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:10.783
And now we can be happy.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:14.854
But unfortunately, that happiness
isn't going to last very long.

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:17.957
Welcome to the next level.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.325
Isn't this insane?

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:21.394
What in the world is this?

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.230
I know it's a lot to process,
but this level is pretty simple.

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:27.967
When the timer starts, you have 10
minutes to get onto that moving platform,

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:31.738
walk across a balance beam,
then get on another moving platform,

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:35.108
and then jump to safety,
all while avoiding the lasers.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.276
Start the timer.

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.483
I got this. I got this.

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.052
I should have got on.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.721
Hey, this is insane.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.092
That beam is wobbling, dude.
I see it moving.

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:54.127
Let's go, Rain.

00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.499
7 minutes left.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:00.333
I'm good right here.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.901
- Are you going?
- Yeah.

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.572
Okay. So how are we doing this?

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:07.674
I don't know, I'm not going to lie.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.542
That's for you all to figure out.

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:10.777
We're stepping up.

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.412
All right, here I go.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.882
All right.
10 is on the other platform.

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:17.183
Two is on the balance beam?

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.318
Okay.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:20.420
This is it.

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:24.057
- Yes!
- Yeah.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:25.992
Girl power.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.794
Who run the world? Girls!

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:28.695
Time's running out.

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:29.762
Hurry up.

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:33.433
Maybe you all go at the same time.

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.568
Oh, she did it. Oh, there's two!

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:37.036
Nice and easy.

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:42.308
All right, let's see it.
You're the last one.

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:44.410
Only 4 minutes remain.
Hey, there's a laser behind you.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.546
- Turn around.
- We're good. We're good

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.315
- Yes!
- Yeah!

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:50.683
Girl Power!

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:51.751
Oh my God!

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:55.722
There's only three and a half minutes left.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:01.260
It's going to go back.

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:03.529
- Let's go!
- Oh my God!

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:05.164
- That was sick, dude!
- Oh my God!

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.233
Player eight is
the only one still competing.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:09.001
We got time, baby. We got time.

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.504
Yo, I don't know about this one, guys.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.612
You've only got a couple of lasers left.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.514
Oh, my God.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.254
- There he is!
- No way bro!

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:30.690
Yeah, that was the hardest one
so far, not gonna lie.

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.725
Congratulations on surviving.

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:35.628
Let's go to the next level
that has giant death beams.

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:37.029
Death beam.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.865
Yeah, that's right. Death beams.

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:41.467
I spent $42
trillion on this spaceship.

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:43.035
You don't think
I'm going to add a death beam?

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:45.204
Welcome to level four.

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.074
What are we looking at over there?

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:48.708
I can't tell.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:50.710
My heart is beating like crazy, bro.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.244
Boys.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.612
Fire the death beams.

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.749
Oh! What the…?

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:02.588
Yo! What?

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:05.958
So as you'll see before it fires,
you see a little flash of light.

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:07.026
Your goal is simple.

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:09.862
Reach the other side without touching
any of the red lasers

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:13.833
or getting absolutely cremated
by the giant blue death lasers.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.767
Have fun.

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:30.850
Underneath it.

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:57.009
Number six is safe.

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:00.613
Eight's safe.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.915
Let me take that.
Let's go, come on.

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:08.454
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:13.793
Okay.

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:14.861
Oh, man.

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:16.329
It's only number four.

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:34.080
I think he made it.

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:38.384
Give me the box.

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.353
Here, touch the box.

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:45.491
Dubs baby. Let's go.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.593
That one got the adrenaline pumping.

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:50.897
I'm glad four of you survive because,
like, levels six, seven, eight,

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:52.665
nine and ten,
we're all very expensive.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.634
So I hope you don't all lose soon.

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.602
But to be honest,
I'd be very surprised

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:58.738
if someone didn't lose
on this next one.

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.740
What the heck is this?

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.208
Come inside the prison.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.177
Close the laser door.

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:07.947
Oh, bro.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.650
You're now trapped
in a giant laser prison.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.687
And at some random point in the next
10 hours, these lasers will turn off

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.522
for exactly three and a half seconds,

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:18.624
and you'll have to run
and touch the money

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:21.661
before they turn back on, you know how
short three and a half seconds is?

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:24.330
- And how massive this room is?
- No way, bro.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.965
- No way.
- Have fun.

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:29.101
When do you ever get 10 hours
to prepare for

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:30.770
the biggest three
and a half seconds of your life?

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.705
How long can a person
go without sleeping?

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:34.674
I've gone like 48 hours for sure.

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:35.908
- No problem.
- Why?

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:38.077
I was, like, playing
video games one night or something.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.479
You think we're actually
going to get to the 10-hour mark?

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:41.647
I think we are.

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.720
It's pretty intimidating, not going to lie.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:48.821
Simon says touch the laser.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.858
I don't know what the
rules on tripping are but...

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.760
we might find out pretty soon.

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:57.296
Turn off the lasers. Please.

00:09:57.463 --> 00:09:58.364
I'm really hungry.

00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:00.499
- Yeah.
- Think they're going to bring in food?

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:01.801
We ain't getting no food.

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:04.236
And if they bring dinner in here,
we're here for 10 hours

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.072
and they bring some kind of food.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:07.340
Oh, sheesh!

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.608
How's it going?

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:09.742
Just wanted to make sure you're awake.

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.110
- We're awake.
- We are now.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.345
How many hours
do you think it's been?

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.412
I think we're going on three.

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:17.249
It's been six and a half hours and you're
probably hungry, so boys bring it in.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.953
We also brought you guys some Prime.

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.021
Thanks, KSI.

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.890
- This is your first time trying Prime?
- This is my first sip of Prime.

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:25.358
Let's see it.

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:27.426
- Your first ever sip of Prime.
- This is crazy.

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:30.229
- What do you think of it?
- It was just like the Popsicle.

00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:31.263
 I was surprised as well.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.298
It tastes pretty good.

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.000
- Enjoy your Prime and food.
- Thank you!

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:35.034
Thank you.

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:36.702
- 6 hours?
- I don't think so, bro.

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:38.037
It's not been 6 hours.

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:39.505
The minute these turn off, I'm out.

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:45.678
This is starting to get not fun.

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:48.447
I do not spend all this time in here

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:50.383
to not touch that box.

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:52.918
Do you know the
longer that we stand in here,

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.754
the slower you're
going to run across?

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:56.055
 You're going to be done for.

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:57.923
10 minutes to 10 hours,

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:00.026
Like what kind of range is that,
Jimmy?

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:01.927
What are you doing to us right now?

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:04.897
This is crazy.

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:08.768
I feel like an animal in a cage.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.173
It's five in the morning and
they have been in there for seven hours.

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:15.808
The stakes are high.

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:17.743
They're all staring at the money.

00:11:17.743 --> 00:11:19.011
It's getting primal.

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.480
But if we press this button,
the lasers will cut off

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:23.049
for three and a half seconds.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.688
You may press the button.

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:40.399
Will they make it? Will they make it?

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:48.507
They all got it.

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.245
That felt like the end of the world.

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:54.613
Oh, my gosh.

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:56.849
How are all of you that alert?

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.050
It is 5 a.m.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.685
That was 7 hours.

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:01.087
We're just that determined.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.455
Because nobody got out,

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:04.957
we're going to have to run it back
for another 10 hours.

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:08.661
- I'm kidding, that was a joke
- Okay. Okay.

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.730
It's been way too long of a day.
Follow me.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:11.731
We're like, "What?"

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:13.165
We're like, "Wait a minute."

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:16.502
But days are kind of irrelevant
when you're on a spaceship.

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:18.471
A giant spaceship.

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:19.405
Come on in.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.673
- What...
- Morning!

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.874
- ...in the world?
- Morning.

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:22.808
Come on in.

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:24.710
So welcome to Level seven.

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:27.279
Dude.
What in the world, bro?

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:29.248
You're probably wondering,

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.916
why am I holding so much prime?

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:37.490
It's because Prime Hydration is a zero
added sugar hydration drink.

00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:41.594
This bad boy is only 20 calories,
naturally flavored with 10%

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:42.595
coconut water

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:45.631
and enough vitamins and electrolytes
to keep these contestants

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:47.566
going throughout the entire video,

00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:50.836
all without
a single milligram of caffeine.

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:54.473
And because the company is founded
by my friends Logan, Paul and KSI,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.509
if you do this course
while holding prime,

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:57.877
I'll give you $10,000.

00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:59.879
- Holding a bottle or the whole tray?
- Just holding a bottle.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:00.813
Here you go.

00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:01.947
Catch.

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:05.785
Each contestant needs to hold
a bottle of Prime while jumping

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:08.821
from platform to platform
and avoiding the lasers on the floor.

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:12.792
The lasers will briefly disappear
every 30 seconds, so they're welcome

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.661
to try what seems to be the easy
way out and risk running.

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:17.630
Or they can make the jump.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.131
My heart is pounding.

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:20.566
- Can I go?
- Yeah, go ahead.

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:21.934
Yeah, you go first, if you want.

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.836
Dude, I wanna take my time.

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:25.704
Okay, I think I can make that.

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:27.206
Oh, he just jumped.

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:28.440
What the heck?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.977
The thing is, the further
you get, the further they get apart.

00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:34.914
I don't know if I can jump that.

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:41.887
Nice, Rain.

00:13:41.887 --> 00:13:43.389
Oh, this is scary.

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:47.493
Are you going to jump it
if I move?

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:48.761
Once she jumps, I'll jump.

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:49.795
All right, bet.

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:56.001
Just in case. Just in case.
I could use the floor that time.

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:57.136
You see, I knew it was coming.

00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:58.070
That was smart.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.574
Okay, now my adrenaline is pumping.

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.177
- Yes!
- Let's go. All right. She's alive.

00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:06.145
We're good.

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:11.817
That was good.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:12.818
You went so far.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.019
I don't know if I touched it, though.

00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:15.387
We got to look at the camera footage.

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:17.356
We're going to replay that,
instant replay.

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:18.824
Karl, what's the verdict?

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:27.800
Number 8 is eliminated.

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:29.668
You definitely hit it, I promise.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.804
We'll still give you
the $10,000 for the Prime.

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:32.738
It's official.

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:34.240
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:35.741
It hurts.

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:37.176
It hurts. But, you know...

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:38.444
Hey, grab that 10 grand briefcase
for the Prime.

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:41.380
Prime makes it taste a little bit
better, makes it go down some.

00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:42.481
See you, dude.

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:43.515
Thanks Jimmy.

00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:44.984
No problem, thanks for coming out.

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:47.119
- You have a great day.
- I'm sorry.

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:48.020
I'm sorry.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.588
Life is crazy right now.

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:51.023
And now three remain.

00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:57.329
Number 4 isn't ready,
but he's going after this one.

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.033
You're good, you're good.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.068
How does your heart feel?

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:03.702
Better.

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:05.738
I'm going this next time.

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:07.139
Don't play no games with me, okay?

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:11.911
She got it.

00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:13.312
I'm going to get out the way.

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:15.915
All right.

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.449
We have our first finisher.

00:15:17.883 --> 00:15:18.817
Thank you!

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.420
Oh, look at those feet.

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:25.491
Straight shot, baby.

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:29.762
He almost broke it.

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.497
Dude, I lost my first step.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.634
Don't kiss my money.

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:36.835
Why's he kissing my money?

00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:38.137
Last one remaining.

00:15:38.704 --> 00:15:39.972
That's a lot of pressure.

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:44.343
Okay.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:48.380
Okay!

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.982
We have three finishers.

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:51.016
Yeah.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.251
And these next three levels

00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:56.522
are going to determine
who walks away with $250,000.

00:15:56.555 --> 00:15:58.290
Welcome to Level seven.

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:00.359
You have two choices.

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:03.395
You can either eliminate yourself
and win a Tesla or

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:06.532
keep competing for a chance
to win $250,000.

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:07.399
What will it be?

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:08.934
There's like a billion lasers
over there.

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:09.902
You think
you got to get through that?

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:11.470
If you're a quiter,
go for the Tesla.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.507
You have a guaranteed
40 grand or a 33% chance of 250.

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.643
There's a way through these lasers,
though, right?

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:18.310
Of course.
Nolan.

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:20.446
- You're being annoying.
- This thing's just really comfortable.

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:22.748
That's the car I wanted.
I got to get the money.

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:23.749
Give me money!

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:25.718
- All right.
- Yeah.

00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:27.886
- Okay.
- Boys, boys.

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:29.888
Go get your cars, ladies.
I'm going to get this cash.

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:32.358
If all three of you go over here to get it,
that's crazy.

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:33.292
I'm going to send it.

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:34.526
I want to make it to Room 10.

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:36.295
This is actually
a big decision for you

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:38.697
because you know they're doing it
now. They can't come back.

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:40.299
- Yeah, I know.
- If you pick the Tesla...

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:41.633
you can drive it out today.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.603
There's a chance you walk over
with nothing over there.

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:45.971
- You don't want the money?
- Yeah.

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:46.939
Turning it down?

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:48.207
Look at this thing.

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:50.209
Five, four,

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:52.644
three, two.

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:53.979
You can walk out with this car.

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:54.780
One...

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.048
Just go get the car.

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:56.849
Take your pick.

00:16:56.915 --> 00:16:57.316
I know.

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:59.318
- I'm sorry. You'll probably hate me.
- Just pick!

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:01.587
Free car or a chance to win money.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.356
I'm going to go with...

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:05.324
The money.

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:07.092
- Let's do it.
- You never get this chance.

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:08.761
Head on down there.
Let's do this.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.396
I cannot believe nobody
went for the Teslas.

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:11.263
Go ahead, Rain.

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:12.531
You waited long enough.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:14.533
Dang!

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:17.503
I'm good. Look, I got to make sure
this booty don't hit nothing.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.371
Dude, that is so tight.

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:20.439
Yeah, that is tight.

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:22.608
There's two paths
and one is a dead end.

00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:23.942
I think she's going
to the dead end.

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:25.411
Oh, my gosh.

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.379
You are, like,
literally a millimeter away.

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:29.715
She's about to shimmy
her way to 250 grand.

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:31.750
Well, a chance at 250.

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.452
- You have one little choke-point left.
- You're almost done.

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:34.486
I'm coming, Karl.

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:37.456
I can see you right now and
there's no lasers between us.

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:38.590
Hit that.

00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:39.758
Yeah.

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:40.426
Touch that.

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:42.461
All right, we have our first finisher.

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:43.529
I did it. I did it.

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:44.396
You could do anything.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.899
Ten, if they both touch lasers, you win.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.801
- Six… it's not a race.
- Oh my God!

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:49.902
This isn't NASCAR.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.670
- I know, I just...
- Are you going for a world record?

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:54.640
I'm just scared if I don't go through this,
I'm going to start shaking.

00:17:58.777 --> 00:18:01.013
Let's go!

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.014
All right, one more.

00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:03.782
Everyone focus your attention on four.

00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:05.250
This is the hardest part right here.

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:06.652
It gets very, very narrow.

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:07.753
Oh, watch your foot.

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:08.921
Will his butt hit it?

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:11.590
I know it hasn't. I said, "will".
I'll speak more clearly.

00:18:11.623 --> 00:18:13.325
Oh, my God, I'm literally sweating.

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:15.194
That is so tight.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.464
I need to get out of here,
if I go right there and jump over.

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:19.565
Can I do that?

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:20.365
I approve.

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:22.000
You can jump over
the laser wall.

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:23.202
Yes, if he can clear this wall,

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:24.169
He might win this whole thing.

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:28.207
You think it'd be easier to jump over
this and walk along the edge

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:30.075
and jump back over
than to go through the base?

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:32.444
I mean, maybe not easier,
but I definitely have more confidence

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:34.513
doing that.
I want to see you jump over this.

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:36.081
Just to be clear,
I think this is awesome.

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:38.083
Now, who's the one
having to make a decision, Blake?

00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:40.586
I can clear that, I'm doing it.

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:50.929
He did it.

00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:52.498
That was crazy.

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:53.866
You two thought
he was going to hit it.

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:55.534
Look at their faces.
They're so mad.

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:56.635
What the heck?

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:58.770
- Now he's walking along the edge.
- Oh my God.

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:00.372
He's going to have to jump back now.

00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:02.407
Dude,
it is definitely taller over here.

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:04.409
We didn't build the set with this
in mind.

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:05.978
He's literally breaking the game.

00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:08.080
And our set, apparently.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.581
These walls aren't super strong

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:11.517
because we didn't
plan on people doing this.

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.852
If you fall, you're out.
Just, you know.

00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:15.454
This is insane.

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:19.858
No way he did it.

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:21.593
What the frick just happened?

00:19:21.593 --> 00:19:22.394
Let's just go to the other room.

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:23.662
Follow me to the in-between room.

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:25.631
That was the craziest thing
I've ever seen.

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:27.533
Starting out when
it was ten of us...

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:29.735
Did any of you all think
it would be us, last three?

00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:31.503
I saw both of you as a threat.

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:32.404
You all are like the same person.

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:34.373
If you were silhouettes,
it'd be like the same person.

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:36.909
As long as I keep going first,
that's going to be the way I win.

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.577
Honestly,
I can't follow behind anyone.

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:40.546
I have to trust in myself
and go for it.

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:41.413
I won't lose.

00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:44.283
Complete honesty,
I have no idea what happens next.

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:45.851
That's why
I want to get to the next door.

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:46.718
Let's go to the next room.

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:48.954
Now, making a bunch of
laser mazes is pretty tough,

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.123
so I had my friends
help me with this next one.

00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:53.458
- Welcome.
- Hi, guys.

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:54.893
- Hey.
- This is your money.

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:57.129
This level only has three lasers.

00:19:57.129 --> 00:20:00.766
I let each of the boys place a laser,
and those are the only three ones

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:01.500
on this level.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.068
Turn on Nolan's laser.

00:20:05.237 --> 00:20:06.705
I call this one the "up and down".

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:07.806
That's not that crazy.

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:08.907
I'd call it pathetic.

00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:10.509
Turn on Tareq's laser.

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:13.011
I call this one side to side.

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:14.112
Very creative.

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:15.414
What do you guys think of it so far?

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:17.115
- That's pretty crazy.
- It's pretty hard.

00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:18.984
Now turn on Karl's laser.

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:21.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.521
And there you go.

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:24.456
 Level 8 is these three lasers.

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:25.857
Not a fan of the green one.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.793
Hey, guys, you're supposed to run, not sit.

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:29.661
Hey, why don't you guys
go to the control room?

00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:31.663
- I see the path.
- I see the path too.

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:34.132
Oh, he's gone.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.404
What the heck?

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:40.606
Hey no pressure, guys.

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:42.007
He didn't even say he was going.

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:43.709
He just. He just went.

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:44.676
What just happened?

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:46.445
I blinked,
and he was already at the money.

00:20:46.445 --> 00:20:49.514
I know I wasn't saying much,
but I just had to zone in, block

00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:52.451
everything out
and see the path and take off.

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:54.853
We officially have
our first finisher.

00:20:54.853 --> 00:20:58.357
If they both get out,
you win $250,000.

00:20:58.423 --> 00:20:59.524
No pressure, fellas.

00:20:59.524 --> 00:21:00.659
Oh, she's going.

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:01.927
All right, our second go.

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:07.065
The green hit her.

00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:08.300
It's up to you, Yei!

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.404
The only thing standing between number four
and a quarter of a million dollars is you.

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:14.806
If you get out, he officially wins.

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:16.041
This is...

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:17.009
I don't know, dude.

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:18.844
You got to show me
how bad you want it, Yei.

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:20.812
I'm really scared.

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:21.713
What'll get you out?

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:22.814
- The Karl laser.
- Look at me.

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:24.650
The Nolan laser, the Tareq laser.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.052
Oh, she's gone.
She started a little bit...

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:30.188
Okay, the red one.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.628
She did it.

00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:38.063
She did it!

00:21:38.096 --> 00:21:39.598
- She made it!
- Yeah, it was incredible.

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:42.901
Well, I feel like she made that
30 trillion times harder than he did

00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:44.002
Did the laser touch me?

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:44.936
No, you did it.

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:45.937
Are you sure?

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:47.472
Didn't hit a laser.
You're good.

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:48.440
What?

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:50.275
You got to be kidding me.

00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:51.777
Oh, my gosh.

00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:53.779
It's time for us
to go to the ninth level.

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:56.982
Only one of you is going to survive
this final level.

00:21:57.449 --> 00:21:59.451
Basically, it's a level
where you go until one of you loses.

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:01.520
- Okay.
- I'll see you there.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.655
- Are we fighting? Laser tag?
- I don't know.

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.490
I'm going to launch a nuke
at the moon.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.892
I have no reason for doing it.

00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:07.793
I just wanted to.

00:22:07.793 --> 00:22:10.195
Let's see who wins $250,000.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:11.330
I'm nervous.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.566
Yeah, this is a mental challenge.
Trying to stay zoned in.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.068
Going on 5:00 AM right here.

00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:17.669
But I came this this far.

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:20.539
I'm in confident
this whole time. I promise I'm ready.

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:21.707
It's like, what, 5:00 AM?

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:22.774
Yes.

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:24.876
I don't even know.
I don't even know.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.011
I'm tired.

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:28.413
But I got to do every
one of these rounds,

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:31.216
and just like,
show people that I can do it.

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:32.351
I hope they both win.

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:34.986
- That's just not how it works.
- They both really deserve it.

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:36.254
Just add suspense.

00:22:36.254 --> 00:22:38.423
We made them wait a few hours.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.491
This sucks.

00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:40.992
I know.

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:43.061
I hate it so much.

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:44.930
Waiting's making me nervous.

00:22:44.963 --> 00:22:46.732
Oh, my God.

00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:49.201
I can't believe you both said no
to the Teslas.

00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:51.536
It's top three. You got it.
I mean, we're one room away.

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:52.571
Go big or go home.

00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:54.840
In your mind, what are the
odds you win the next level?

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.741
100%.

00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:56.808
Really?

00:22:56.808 --> 00:22:57.809
I feel confident.

00:22:57.843 --> 00:23:00.145
Well, he's pretty confident,
but I'm just like...

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:02.814
I hope I win,
I really, really hope I win.

00:23:02.814 --> 00:23:04.616
You guys have any last words?

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:07.285
Not really.
I'm kind of, I'm kind of zoned in.

00:23:07.285 --> 00:23:08.353
I'll shake your hand.

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:13.024
And now we're enemies.

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:24.770
Welcome to the final level.

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:28.140
For this last level,
we combined all the previous mazes

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.341
into one.

00:23:32.177 --> 00:23:34.179
Player number six come in.

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:38.150
My Lord.

00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:39.751
Hold there for one second.

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:42.654
Player number four, come on in.

00:23:42.654 --> 00:23:45.056
Holy smokes.

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:46.958
Okay.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:50.228
Since there's only two of you,
this one's a little different.

00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:52.164
You either touch the money first,

00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:53.498
instantly winning it,

00:23:53.865 --> 00:23:57.169
or your opponent touches a laser
before you,

00:23:57.302 --> 00:23:59.471
thus they're eliminated
and you instantly win.

00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:01.440
Number four, does that make sense?

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.008
I hear you out loud and clear.

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:04.876
Number six, does that make sense?

00:24:04.876 --> 00:24:05.744
Makes sense.

00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:09.648
I'm going to give you both 30 seconds
to weigh this massive strategic decision.

00:24:09.714 --> 00:24:11.416
This is for all the marbles.

00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:12.417
I want to win this.

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.186
Dude, my heart is...

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:17.122
Dude, he looks so nervous right now.

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:19.991
If you try to run this,
you're going to hit a laser.

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:22.093
I'm just standing there.
That is definitely the strat.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.463
I got to play offense.
I want to go as far as I can.

00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:25.831
Ten more seconds.

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:27.165
Yep, as fast as I can.

00:24:27.566 --> 00:24:28.567
Release the dogs.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.634
I'm going to send it.

00:24:29.835 --> 00:24:32.304
I'm not waiting for him to mess up.
I'm going to send it.

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:34.673
Say the word Jimmy.
Let me go. Let me go.

00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:36.141
I'm not waiting.

00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:37.242
Three.

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:38.510
Two.

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:39.578
One.

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:41.780
Begin.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.547
All right.

00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:44.716
Like I thought Blake is going for it.

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:46.284
He is way ahead.

00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:47.552
Okay.

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:50.255
All right, they're about tied.

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:52.090
Okay, so far no one's out.

00:24:55.093 --> 00:24:56.428
That was close.

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.029
Blake is way ahead.

00:24:58.363 --> 00:24:59.431
Okay.

00:25:00.465 --> 00:25:02.400
Her only hope is that he ends up
getting out here.

00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:14.112
He hit a laser.

00:25:15.213 --> 00:25:16.314
What?

00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:17.883
- He did, he hit it.
- What?

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:18.550
You're lying.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.385
No, hey cut the lasers off.

00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:21.186
It doesn't matter.

00:25:21.219 --> 00:25:23.221
- What?
- Turn them all off.

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:25.457
Don't headbutt it.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.425
Are you okay?
Stop hurting yourself.

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:30.228
What?
That's freaking crazy.

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:33.298
And obviously, Blake, we're going
to give you a second place prize

00:25:33.331 --> 00:25:34.933
of another $10,000.

00:25:34.966 --> 00:25:37.035
because he won $10,000
during the course of Prime.

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:38.837
I know it's not a quarter of a mil.

00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:41.239
- Here's another ten grand.
- Thanks, Mr. Jimmy.

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:43.808
Do you want me to deliver it
in a giant cube

00:25:43.842 --> 00:25:45.510
or would you prefer me
just wire you the money?

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.245
I want you to bring it to me
in a cube.

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:48.947
- What if they try to rob you?
- Oh, I don't know then.

00:25:48.947 --> 00:25:49.981
I'll wire you the money.

00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:52.183
I hope you guys enjoy it.
See you later.

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:53.118
You can stand in it.

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:55.186
Just, you're going to sink, so be careful.

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.657
- Yeah. You see what I mean?
- I sunk through.
