00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:02.869
We just got dropped off
in the middle of an abandoned city.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.938
And we're going to spend the next
seven days here.

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:06.406
And there goes our only way out.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:08.742
We're now stranded
for the next seven days.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.578
Why are we doing this?

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:12.779
For content.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:16.082
This once beautiful city
was bombed an abandoned

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:16.916
because of war,

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.886
which means the only people here
are us and our cameraman.

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:21.121
At least that we know of.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.289
So I guess we start off
by getting off the roof.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.159
We knew that our first objective
was to explore this city

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.529
and find a safe place to call home
for the next seven days,

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.664
which starts
with exploring this building

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.200
All right, let's see what's down
the bottom of this building.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.636
I assume under this wood is a floor.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.271
Only one way to find out.

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:40.440
All right, this is crazy.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.542
I feel like I'm
in a zombie apocalypse.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.476
This is wild.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:44.611
Oh, look at this.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.046
After a little more exploring,

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.648
we stumbled upon an area
that might work for our shelter.

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:49.749
Oh, my Gosh.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.718
I think this is where
we should set up camp.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.087
You can see the entire city
over here.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.356
Plus, we have a
roof to protect us from rain.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.259
And now that we
had our home base decided,

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.560
the next step was to open up

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.363
the supplies crate left
by the helicopter on the roof.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.231
Let's pop open this crate
so we can build camp.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.833
We need some gear.

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:10.670
This crate contains
all of the survival gear

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.105
we'll need for the next seven days.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.340
And so we don't have to carry stuff
all the way down the stairs.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:15.575
We're just going to drop it.

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:19.879
Chandler.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.549
We have a perfect assembly line.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.384
Kris, it's raining
sleeping bags.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.421
Chandler, there's our dinner plates.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.090
Wait, Chandler don't let it fall.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.357
Chandler.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.159
Yeah!

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.462
That was the coolest thing we've ever done.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.765
But jokes aside, it was time
to actually start surviving now.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:40.266
Who wants fire
duty?

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.568
- We'll get it.
- We're on bed duty.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.803
Kris got started on making a fire
with Mark.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.673
I'm personally a fan of the log
cabin when it comes to fires.

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:48.408
Eagle Scout.
Did I mention that yet?

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:52.545
While Chandler and I look
for something for us to sleep on.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.514
This is what mattresses
were like a hundred years ago?

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:55.982
Wait, you found a mattress?

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:56.850
- Yeah.
- Where?

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.218
On the second floor
in a corner.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.288
- That's all you.
- Thanks.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.590
You should wrap
that thing in a tarp

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.791
so you don't get destroyed by bugs.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.493
I'm going to wrap
that mattress like a burrito.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.329
And while Chandler took us chances
with a sketchy mattress,

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.298
The rest of us decided
to sleep on wooden doors.

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.901
There's no shot that you're
more comfortable than me right now.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:16.736
My back already hurts.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:19.539
There are so many buildings
we have yet to explore in the city.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:20.874
Tomorrow's going to be insane.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.208
We'll see you in the morning.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:25.345
Even though our first day in
the city went pretty smooth.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.481
Something eerie did happen to occur
later that night.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:29.749
While we were sleeping,

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.251
Mark and some of the camera guys

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.453
woke up to the sound
of breaking glass

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:34.754
not far from the camp.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:39.826
Which made us start to wonder

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.828
if we were really alone
inside the city.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:42.795
What was it?

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.297
We just heard glass shattering there.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.032
I thought I saw something.

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.800
But on top of the freaky noises,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.236
this first shelter was way
too windy to sleep.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.304
How'd you guys sleep?

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:52.438
Bad.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:55.275
So in pursuit of better sleep,
we got up, got breakfast

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.243
and prepare to find our new shelter.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.412
This is the first time
I've had chili for breakfast.

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:01.281
But I'm so hungry,
I kind of don't care.

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.282
Well, since the raft.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:04.517
When have I ever been
this excited over canned chili?

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.319
I think my brain tried
to forget about that. Thanks.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.222
So after a nutritious breakfast,
we took off our drone

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:11.724
to seek out a new shelter
in the unexplored buildings.

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.159
We haven't explored that building.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.794
We haven't explored those hotels.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:16.496
It is an actual city here.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.331
However, upon
scanning the buildings,

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:20.500
we did stumble upon
an unexpected guest.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.302
- There's a cat.
- There's a cat down there.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.370
I'm going to land the drone
right beside the cat.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:26.973
Look at that shot.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.509
Kris, Kris, look,
it's sniffing the camera.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.511
This cat has no survival instinct.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.113
I promise we are not paying
this cat to be an actor.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:36.983
As fun as playing with these cats
is, we need to focus on shelter

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.151
because it's
going to be freezing tonight.

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.352
And so we started our journey

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:41.321
to find a sufficient shelter
for the challenge.

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:43.289
Wait, what is this?

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:45.592
This is pretty.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:48.528
It just has this type of
like aesthetic to it,

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.630
that is like beautiful
even though it's ugly.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.065
Zombie apocalypse aesthetic.

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.399
Yeah. There you go.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:54.968
Wait, is that a pool?

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:56.869
What the heck?

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.404
This is so eerie.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:01.174
Back in the day,
this used to look something like this.

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:02.175
And after decades

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:05.511
of rotting from being abandoned,
this is what we're left with.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.146
Wait, there's a soccer field?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.915
The sports court.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:10.817
Is that a soccer ball?

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:12.885
I almost died.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:15.088
I bet this soccer ball
is older than me.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.257
Older than all of us, for sure.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.058
Well, besides, Mark,
he's old.

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:19.993
We have two options now.

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:22.462
We can keep exploring
down this cool looking tunnel

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:23.763
and go check
out the neighborhood.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.999
Or with the hour of light we have left,

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.301
we can prep for nighttime
and not freeze all night.

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.270
- Not freeze.
- That sounds like a good idea.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.737
I agree.

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.573
And after spending the entire day
looking for a new shelter,

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:36.342
I just can't get over
how massive the city is.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:39.212
We finally found a place
fortified enough to call home.

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:40.680
So we don't freeze tonight.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.216
We're thinking of setting up camp
in this room right here.

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:44.817
We'll have a fire pit right here.

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.487
We can tarp the wall right there.
It's going to be comfy.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:48.755
Yeah, Mark's
going to do all that.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:49.889
I said we.

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.491
The only hard part is,
come over here.

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.627
Our current camp and all our gear
is all the way over there.

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.229
I hope this place really works out

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.830
because it's going to be
a lot of effort to set up.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.400
With the sun getting low and
the temperature rapidly dropping.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.402
We made our way back
to the old camping spot

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.337
and packed up
to settle into the new base.

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:06.539
We're headed into the new campsite.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.441
The new camp, the new camp.

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.409
The new camp.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:12.512
Okay, we've got a lot of cleanup
to do to prep this for tonight.

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:15.448
This looks like a terrible place,
but whatever.

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:17.350
After finding
a more weatherproof base,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.586
we spent the next few hours dragging
in as many of our belongings

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:22.422
as we could before sundown.

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:27.560
Now, because it got dark so fast,

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:30.129
we couldn't bring all of
our resources to the new base.

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.798
So aside from one water bag,

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:35.168
cans of chili and a couple of old
mattresses, this is all we had.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.437
What does everyone
think of our new place?

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.105
I like that there's no wind.

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:40.573
And it's much warmer.

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:41.674
Chandler?

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:42.742
What?

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:45.812
It was now the third day
of seven doing this challenge.

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.647
And once we got up,
we continued exploring.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.081
Be careful.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.315
These stairs actually steep.

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:50.783
On this whole staircase,

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:52.785
three of the stairs are normal.

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:54.287
This beach is nice.

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.488
It actually smells like a beach.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.323
It's because it is a beach.

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:00.226
But not too far in,
something strange happened.

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:01.694
I think I see someone.

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:02.729
What?

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:05.164
Don't you see that reflecting thing
over there under the stairs?

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:05.965
Oh, I do.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:08.034
Jimmy, remember how we almost died

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:09.802
the first night from glass
bottle attack?

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:12.205
I wonder if that's
where the glass bottles came from.

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:14.173
It was at this moment
when we realized

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:17.377
we actually weren't alone
in this abandoned city after all.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.646
And once our cameraman spotted
this mysterious person on our drone,

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.348
we did what anyone would do.

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:23.216
Let's go check it out.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.951
Investigation.

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:26.119
That building is sick.

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:29.255
Why is this mansion beside
this giant motel?

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:32.992
Decades ago, this hotel stood
as a first class vacation resort.

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:36.129
But years of war
turn this once picturesque property

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.630
into a city of ruins.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.898
Let's head on in.

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:41.167
What did we just get ourselves into?

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:43.102
We totally don't
wait for the cameraman

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.670
to walk in the room before we go in.

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:46.139
Anyways.

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:47.640
It's getting dark.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.875
Everyone, stop.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:49.909
Stop.

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:50.943
Candy.

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:51.677
We should go in there.

00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:52.545
I'll go first.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:53.312
Go ahead.
Thank you.

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:54.847
You think it's a Feastables bar?

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.082
What the heck?

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.985
This is starting to get very eerie,
and I think Mark should go first.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:06:59.986
What?

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.321
Look at how deep this hallway is.

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.357
Also, if you fall over here,
you might die.

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:07.460
There's a very non-zero chance
somebody could be in here.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.861
and like attack us.

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:10.696
If someone attacked us.
What are we doing?

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:11.564
Every man for himself.

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.199
Yeah, whoever's the slowest just dies.

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:14.667
What's that light?

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:17.170
Hello.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.071
I'm creeped out now, guys.

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.374
We spent the rest of the day
searching for the lurk,

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:23.009
but once it started getting dark,

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.778
we can only hope that later
he wouldn't be looking for us.

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:27.146
And now that it's dark out,

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:28.948
here's what
we've actually been waiting for.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.049
Give me Big Bertha.

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:32.752
Thank you.

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:34.520
Big Bertha.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.422
Notice how you can't
see that building over there.

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:38.658
This is the world's
most powerful flashlight.

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:40.293
Now you can.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.662
Bro, I bet the fish
in the ocean are tripping.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:45.598
It stopped working.

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:47.200
How the mighty have fallen.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.736
The pluses of our actions
is we got to play with the world's

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:51.838
strongest flashlight at night.

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:54.640
The negatives of our actions is that
we got to walk back in the dark.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.142
That was bad timing.

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:58.411
It's way scarier going
through this place at night.

00:07:58.444 --> 00:07:59.712
Yeah, a thousand percent.

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.347
It really
feels like the world is ending

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:02.815
and we're just like surviving.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.051
So to avoid being murdered in cold blood,

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.486
we return back the camp.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.753
We're back at camp.

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:09.789
Yeah. I'll get a fire going.

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:10.523
I'm hungry.

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:12.325
There's literally only chili left.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:15.294
And so with the last of our supply
here, we're feasting.

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:17.463
Tomorrow, if we got
some tables and seven chairs.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.998
- And more food.
- That'd be awesome.

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:22.001
But when we woke up on the morning
of day four out of seven,

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:24.570
we realized that we were already
running low on supplies.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.739
Our bag of water is out of water.

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:27.573
Do we have more?

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:30.176
Point the camera at that roof,
all the way over there.

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:33.746
I wish I had more than a hundred
calories in my body to go get it.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:34.747
Nose goes.

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:36.415
What does nose goes mean?

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:37.550
It sounds like you're going.

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:39.318
He's going to need help.
He can't carry it on his own.

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:41.721
So Mark and Chandler
set out to go all the way back

00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:44.123
to ground Zero
to get more supplies from the crate.

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:46.559
Chandler and I,
we're on a side quest for water.

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:47.460
This is a main quest.

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:48.427
While they get the water,

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:49.529
we don't want to be useless.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.763
We? I'm fine.

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:52.665
I don't want us to be useless.

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.934
So we're going to go
try to find a table and some chairs.

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:57.703
But we didn't get very far before
Kris got distracted,

00:08:57.803 --> 00:08:59.906
Did we not know this was here?

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:01.107
Jimmy?

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:03.075
- Yeah?
- I found a bike.

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:04.744
That looks like a nice bike.

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:06.412
- Where'd you find that?
- In here.

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:08.414
This is the coolest abandoned city ever.

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:10.116
- Having fun?
- I am.

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:11.984
All right, I'm going to go
look for a table.

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:13.185
Okay, Let's go.

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:15.254
How are we going
to get the water out of this?

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:17.223
It's heavy.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.959
The thought process is that
this is a house.

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:21.527
And what do people have
in their house?

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:22.328
Tables and chairs.

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:23.229
Exactly.

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:24.397
Wait, hold up.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.731
Look at this.
Don't move.

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:26.799
Yes.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.135
Jimmy, Jimmy.

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:30.770
it's a chair.

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:33.940
Mark's strong.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.675
A little help here, Chan.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.643
This bag of water is over a hundred pounds.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.112
And so my buddy Mark,
being the science YouTuber that he is,

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:42.515
had an idea to get it down
from the roof more effectively.

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:43.549
But...

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:53.326
Our rope broke.

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.194
We need stronger rope.

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:56.462
What you're watching is real.

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:59.065
Mark literally deleted
half of our water.

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.200
We got some bad news.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.935
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:07.173
The rope broke and
all the water splattered on the ground.

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:09.775
This was actually
a very serious problem.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.410
Oh, no.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.345
Are you kidding me?

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.546
Mark!

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:14.747
Sorry!

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:17.249
Don't worry, dude,
we got one bag of water left.

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:18.751
Carry this one down, please.

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:21.487
And now that half of our water
is actually gone.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.657
The only possible way to complete
this seven day challenge would

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:26.792
unfortunately,
be to send two of us home.

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:29.128
So Kris and Chandler volunteered
to leave the city,

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:31.597
leaving Mark and I
with just enough resources

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.199
to make it the full seven days.

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.801
Genuinely,
I would be scared if we left Jimmy

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.036
with anybody other than you.

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:38.838
- I think you got it.
- Oh, you guys.

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:39.839
But before they left,

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.441
we wanted to have one final feast
with the whole gang.

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:44.543
Now that's a Feastables smores.

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.079
My hair.
Yummy.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:49.548
Great melting point on the chocolate,
Jimmy, if I may.

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:52.451
If you've tried Feastables before,
the ones that used to look like this,

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.819
you haven't tried Feastables.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.855
Our brand new formula tastes
so much better.

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:58.157
Genuinely go to Walmart, try Feastables

00:10:58.157 --> 00:10:59.091
and tell me what you think.

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:03.429
It's honestly way better than the old
formula, but don't take my word for it.

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:05.398
I just worked at NASA, so.

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:10.703
Well, I just had s'mores
so I can go to the boat now?

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.105
And so we launched a flare
to signal the boat,

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:14.874
which was actually pretty cool.

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:16.375
Bro, look how cool that looks.

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.744
Wait, it's lighting up the entire city.

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:22.348
But the not cool part is now
that Kris and Chandler are gone,

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:24.550
it's just Mark
and I surviving in the city.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.751
I feel so lonely.

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.987
It's our first day
without our friends.

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.822
But we're going to make
the best of the situation.

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:32.591
Our objective for today
is to renovate our shelter.

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.694
We're going to put up tarps
and windproof this room.

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:37.063
We're going to build
a fireplace in here and heat it up.

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:38.731
We're going to find shelves and tables.

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:40.499
We're going to make this place
looks like a home

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:44.336
With some of the ideas we have planned
I might stick around until day 14.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.271
He's lying.

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:47.406
And so we started exploring
some nearby buildings

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:48.974
to find furnishing for our shelter,

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:50.042
which is when we found this

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:53.045
awesome shelf,
this little table, a massive carpet,

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:55.781
and also this metal thing
that was found by our camera guy.

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:57.083
Look at this chair.

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:58.417
That works still, man.

00:11:58.417 --> 00:12:00.019
Bro. That's comf.

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:03.489
I found a fake TV.

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:05.391
We can make it
look like we have a TV now.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.292
It's a good find.

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:08.360
Wow, that's just so cool,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.062
this like courtyard with the arches.

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:13.265
Each building in this city
has its own personality.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:14.333
What can we do with these?

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:16.168
We could use, like, a vent system
like this.

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:18.304
Combined with these,
we can make a fireplace.

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:20.239
Like actual wallpaper.

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:21.373
We have wallpaper.

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:22.341
What do we use it for?

00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:24.176
To make the house a home,
Jimmy.

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.512
It's like we went grocery shopping,
but instead

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:28.280
we grabbed a bunch of 30-year-old garbage

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.116
Honey, we're home.

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:31.584
We found all this stuff.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.018
Now we're going to start decorating.

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:35.821
We're no longer surviving,
Jimmy. We're thriving.

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:36.422
I like that.

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:38.357
We literally spent the next 4 hours

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:40.126
moving all the rubble
out of our shelter,

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:41.360
which made us pretty thirsty.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.529
The water in these sacks
tastes like trash,

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:45.364
which is why we all
brought a Cirkul water bottle,

00:12:45.364 --> 00:12:47.032
because you can put a flavor
cartridge in it

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:48.200
and make water taste good.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.269
This is my first time
drinking a Cirkul bottle.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:51.704
Delightful experience.

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:53.139
You can determine the intensity.

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:56.609
So if you're feeling really audacious,
you can have level nine flavor.

00:12:56.642 --> 00:12:58.711
Or if you're just a wuss,
you can have a level one flavor.

00:12:58.744 --> 00:12:59.478
I’m trying six.

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:01.147
Six. I'll match your six.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.815
That tastes awesome.

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:04.216
Which flavor are you using?

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:06.452
I'm rocking fruit punch
because it's got energy.

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:08.053
And you know what we need right now,
Jimmy?

00:13:08.154 --> 00:13:08.888
Energy.

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:10.890
- That's right
- Good thing Cirkul has our back.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.291
And now that we had been hydrated,

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.560
it was time to start crushing
these renovations.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.961
When everything's said and done,

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:19.298
this room will be the greatest room in
an abandoned city you've ever seen.

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:20.432
This is our new shelf.

00:13:20.432 --> 00:13:21.834
All right, let's see how she looks.

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:23.035
See that?
See all that dust?

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:25.204
Oh, isn't that satisfying?

00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:27.740
And now that the shelf is clean,
we can use it to store food.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.242
For some reason, over half
the food we packed is chili.

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:31.911
And no one here likes chili.

00:13:31.944 --> 00:13:33.112
That's the non chili row.

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.146
That's the chili row.

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:36.215
This is the Feastables row right there.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:38.984
Now we have a table
to put our Cirkul water bottles.

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:41.754
Mark has a 22 ounce bottle.
This is the 32 ounce bottle.

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:43.889
And they have a metal double
insulated bottle

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:46.792
that you can get for free right now
if you buy ten flavor cartridges.

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:47.560
What a steal.

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:48.794
It's not a steal.
It's free.

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:52.031
All right.

00:13:52.064 --> 00:13:53.632
That's going to block a lot of wind.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:54.967
With our new door in place,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.836
we also hung up this huge tarp,

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.470
which will allow us
to keep all the heat

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.406
from the fireplace inside our shelter.

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:01.507
Oxygen comes in,

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.643
fire burns, sends heat in the room,
send smoke out.

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.946
This is redneck
engineering at its finest.

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:09.215
Finally,
after being cold for so long.

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:10.783
- All right.
- Look at that.

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:12.318
And we have a fire.

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:13.652
I can feel the heat coming out.

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:17.289
Wait, Jimmy rigged this up
in like ruins from an abandoned city.

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:19.592
Anyway, go to DrinkCirkul.com/MrBeast...

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:23.162
Or scan the QR code on his face,
if you want to order a Cirkul right now.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.865
This is the final room.
We have plenty in the corner.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.967
We have our beds
that are now smaller.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.335
Tell me this isn't genius.

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:32.004
This is Mark's iPad in the TV frame.

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:34.306
Obviously some nice lighting,
a furnace

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:37.142
that is heating up the room,
a real table with chairs

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:40.512
and a shelving unit
with the scraps of food we have left

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.314
and a dirty towel
we've been sharing.

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:43.949
This is survival.

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:47.353
But just as our night was going so
well for the fifth day in a row,

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:49.788
we heard a broken glass.

00:14:49.788 --> 00:14:51.523
- Mark.
- I'm right here, dog.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.491
What was that?

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:54.994
Man, we were having such a good day too.

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:56.462
I want to go see who's upstairs.

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:59.298
I'm carrying the knife as a threat,
but I'm not going to use it.

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:01.567
Hey, if you're up here,
just come out.

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:03.369
I want to be best friends with you.

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:05.170
Are you serious, you're not pranking me?

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:07.606
Bro, I swear to you it was not me.

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:09.141
Hello.

00:15:09.608 --> 00:15:11.210
What is this?

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:12.411
Bro!
Oh, my God.

00:15:12.444 --> 00:15:14.947
This is the most Mark Rober thing
I've ever seen.

00:15:16.782 --> 00:15:19.318
What the heck? You swore!

00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:21.453
Yeah, so turns out Mark was pranking us,

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:23.622
and he was the one dropping
these bottles the whole time.

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:25.991
I've got a remote control here.
But no one suspects it.

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:27.559
I can be in my sleeping bag

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:29.762
and I can start launching glass
bottles through the roof.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:30.763
Freak everyone out.

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.031
Oh, my gosh.

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.799
I thought I could trust you.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.270
Now that Mark's not pranking me,
we re-rigged his contraption.

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:39.438
Feastables me.

00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:41.807
There you go.

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:43.309
I'll take one.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:44.977
I got one as well.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.146
That's kind of cool.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.815
To be honest, it was pretty easy
to forgive Mark

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:52.685
because we only had one day left
in this challenge.

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:54.186
Good morning.

00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:57.189
Good morning abandoned city.

00:15:57.189 --> 00:16:00.359
Abandoned city, abandoned city.

00:16:00.392 --> 00:16:02.328
It's so much colder out here
than it is in there.

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.563
Let's go back.

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.098
It's now the morning of day six.

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:08.701
All the modifications
we did were phenomenal

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.502
and it was at least ten degrees
warmer.

00:16:10.502 --> 00:16:12.571
- That was amazing.
- Slept incredible.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.708
Mark, on our last real day,
I say we go have some fun.

00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:20.913
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:21.981
Jimmy, is that a kayak?

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:23.816
I know what we should do with it.

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.853
Now someone can kayak in this pool.

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:29.621
Me and Mark really did have a lot of fun.

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:31.657
Played baseball, played soccer.

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:34.460
Mark even taught me how to skip
rocks scientifically.

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:35.294
There it is.

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:38.097
And even screaming at each other
from different sides of the city.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.698
- Mark!
- What!

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:43.168
Let's throw things off the roof
at the same time!

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.837
Great idea!

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.339
To be honest,
doing all these kind of dumb things

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:50.709
really did take our minds off
of how lonely this city really was.

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:52.678
Yeah!

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:55.848
And by the time
the final day of this challenge arrived

00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:58.650
after cleaning up camp,
we only had one objective in mind.

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:02.488
Leaving this
place and never coming back.

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:04.990
I’m here!

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:06.792
- I’m here!
- Freedom!

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:09.428
Huge shout out to Mark. 
He didn't have to do this. 

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:11.196
He has his own channel is very busy.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.532
Here's the channel.
I appreciate you.

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:14.233
And let's get out of here.

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:15.134
Let's go.

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:17.703
By the way,
I'm giving away $10,000 a day

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:20.239
for the next 20 days to people who
buy Feastables.

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:22.141
Go buy the new formula, it tastes amazing.
