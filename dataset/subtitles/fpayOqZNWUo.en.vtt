00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism to work correctly so it was
 

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.189 align:start position:0%
mechanism to work correctly so it was
had<00:08:24.520><c> a</c><00:08:24.759><c> relay</c><00:08:25.599><c> so</c><00:08:26.039><c> could</c><00:08:26.199><c> make</c><00:08:26.319><c> it</c><00:08:26.440><c> so</c><00:08:26.639><c> the</c><00:08:26.840><c> head</c>

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
had a relay so could make it so the head
 

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.830 align:start position:0%
had a relay so could make it so the head
blew<00:08:27.560><c> up</c><00:08:28.199><c> oh</c><00:08:28.400><c> wow</c><00:08:28.879><c> kind</c><00:08:29.000><c> of</c><00:08:29.080><c> thing</c>

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
blew up oh wow kind of thing
 

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.230 align:start position:0%
blew up oh wow kind of thing
if<00:08:30.000><c> we</c><00:08:30.280><c> hadn't</c><00:08:30.680><c> tried</c><00:08:30.919><c> to</c><00:08:31.159><c> do</c><00:08:31.560><c> that</c><00:08:31.960><c> it</c>

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
if we hadn't tried to do that it
 

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.990 align:start position:0%
if we hadn't tried to do that it
probably<00:08:32.599><c> could</c><00:08:32.719><c> have</c><00:08:32.839><c> been</c><00:08:33.000><c> done</c><00:08:33.159><c> in</c><00:08:33.800><c> half</c>

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
probably could have been done in half
 

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.509 align:start position:0%
probably could have been done in half

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:36.519 align:start position:0%
the time what a cool build though really
 

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:38.670 align:start position:0%
the time what a cool build though really
cool<00:08:36.839><c> did</c><00:08:37.000><c> it</c><00:08:37.080><c> overheat</c><00:08:37.719><c> no</c><00:08:37.880><c> it's</c><00:08:38.120><c> got</c><00:08:38.240><c> an</c><00:08:38.360><c> AO</c>

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
cool did it overheat no it's got an AO
 

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.750 align:start position:0%
cool did it overheat no it's got an AO
for<00:08:38.839><c> fooling</c><00:08:39.560><c> and</c><00:08:39.640><c> it's</c><00:08:39.839><c> got</c><00:08:40.039><c> ample</c><00:08:40.479><c> it's</c><00:08:40.599><c> a</c>

for fooling and it's got ample it's a
 

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.790 align:start position:0%
for fooling and it's got ample it's a
little<00:08:40.959><c> bigger</c><00:08:41.240><c> than</c><00:08:41.360><c> the</c><00:08:41.479><c> bomb</c><00:08:41.839><c> airow</c><00:08:42.320><c> yeah</c>

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
little bigger than the bomb airow yeah
 

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.670 align:start position:0%

it's<00:08:42.919><c> a</c><00:08:43.080><c> little</c>

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
it's a little
 

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.030 align:start position:0%
it's a little

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
bigger that's a feature not a bug I
 

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.350 align:start position:0%
bigger that's a feature not a bug I
think<00:08:48.240><c> the</c><00:08:48.480><c> objective</c><00:08:49.200><c> was</c><00:08:49.480><c> that</c><00:08:49.760><c> if</c><00:08:49.880><c> you</c><00:08:50.080><c> died</c>

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
think the objective was that if you died
 

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.230 align:start position:0%
think the objective was that if you died
in<00:08:50.720><c> Minecraft</c><00:08:51.720><c> we</c><00:08:51.839><c> would</c><00:08:52.120><c> have</c><00:08:52.399><c> some</c><00:08:52.640><c> kind</c><00:08:52.800><c> of</c>

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
in Minecraft we would have some kind of
 

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.910 align:start position:0%
in Minecraft we would have some kind of
API<00:08:53.839><c> something</c><00:08:54.839><c> that</c><00:08:54.959><c> would</c><00:08:55.160><c> make</c><00:08:55.320><c> it</c><00:08:55.680><c> did</c><00:08:55.800><c> it</c>

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
API something that would make it did it
 

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.190 align:start position:0%
API something that would make it did it

had so much worse I'm right here what is
going<00:09:25.480><c> on</c><00:09:26.040><c> well</c><00:09:26.160><c> we</c><00:09:26.279><c> wanted</c><00:09:26.519><c> to</c><00:09:26.760><c> repurpose</c><00:09:27.320><c> a</c>

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
going on well we wanted to repurpose a
 

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.590 align:start position:0%
going on well we wanted to repurpose a
board<00:09:27.800><c> that</c><00:09:27.920><c> we</c><00:09:28.040><c> didn't</c><00:09:28.399><c> care</c><00:09:28.720><c> about</c>

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
board that we didn't care about
 

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.269 align:start position:0%
board that we didn't care about
so<00:09:30.800><c> we</c><00:09:30.959><c> grabbed</c><00:09:31.279><c> one</c><00:09:31.440><c> that</c><00:09:31.560><c> we</c><00:09:31.680><c> had</c><00:09:31.920><c> already</c>

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
so we grabbed one that we had already
 

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:35.030 align:start position:0%
so we grabbed one that we had already
used<00:09:32.600><c> for</c><00:09:32.839><c> subambient</c><00:09:33.440><c> cooling</c><00:09:34.440><c> I</c><00:09:34.600><c> did</c><00:09:34.800><c> not</c>

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
used for subambient cooling I did not
 

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.509 align:start position:0%

causes the water to be chilled below the

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%

00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
bottom gets pumped up to the CPU and
 

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:57.950 align:start position:0%
bottom gets pumped up to the CPU and
then<00:19:56.720><c> goes</c><00:19:56.919><c> back</c><00:19:57.080><c> up</c><00:19:57.200><c> to</c><00:19:57.320><c> the</c><00:19:57.440><c> top</c><00:19:57.600><c> to</c><00:19:57.720><c> fall</c>

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
then goes back up to the top to fall
 

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.110 align:start position:0%
then goes back up to the top to fall
down<00:19:58.240><c> so</c><00:19:58.360><c> you</c><00:19:58.480><c> can</c><00:19:58.679><c> actually</c><00:19:59.559><c> achieve</c>

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
down so you can actually achieve
 

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.830 align:start position:0%
down so you can actually achieve

you<00:20:05.039><c> just</c><00:20:05.120><c> don't</c><00:20:05.280><c> need</c><00:20:05.440><c> a</c><00:20:05.600><c> compressor</c><00:20:06.280><c> yeah</c>

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
you just don't need a compressor yeah
