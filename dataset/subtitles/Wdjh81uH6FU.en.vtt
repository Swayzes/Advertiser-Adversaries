00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:04.471
I am about to work this $10 million
job as a professional athlete.

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.673
And I'm going to show you
the difference between this

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.776
and getting paid $200,000
to be an astronaut.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.211
This is insane.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:14.814
Getting paid $100,000 to dig up
real dinosaur bones.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.116
Oh, my God.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.384
And so many other jobs,

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.853
starting with the lowest paying job
I could find.

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:23.023
Gold panning, that can make as little
as $1 a year.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.491
But we're going
to make millions.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.725
Statistically, not.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:29.462
Basically, gold panners put dirt
in this mechanism, and with enough

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:33.333
shaking and water, all of the gold
is filtered out to the bottom.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.567
But it's not very easy

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:38.238
because after 5 hours of searching,
I was definitely not rich.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.073
Oh, boys. I found gold.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.008
How much is that
little nugget worth?

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:43.777
That is $0.02.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:44.878
Exactly my point.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.447
You could do this for a whole year
and only make a dollar.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.415
But luckily for us,

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:52.419
we're going to be working jobs
that pay over $10 million per year.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.420
But first, let's see

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.489
what it looks like to work a job
that pays $100,000 per year.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.759
Digging up dinosaur bones
for a museum.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.929
And yes, these are fake
because they're all dead.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.531
So this is just one of our pits.

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.633
- Are these actually dinosaur bones?
- They are.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.201
I've been here
17 years.

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.002
This is easily

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.337
the largest bone that I've ever
worked on in my career.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.474
This is your thigh bone right here,
and it's over four feet tall.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.844
For comparison, here's
that dinosaur next to six Karls

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.245
stacked on top of each other.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.513
Keep in mind, I'm six five.

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.416
These
are mini jackhammers, essentially.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.752
You're doing it.
He has no idea what he's doing.

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:26.786
No idea.

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:30.356
Now, this may come as a surprise,
but we are God awful at this.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:32.158
Be careful.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:35.628
It took us 5 hours
to make any progress whatsoever.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.264
But even with us holding him
back with the help of the expert,

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:39.232
we were getting somewhere.

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:42.402
This is easily the largest bone that
I've ever worked on in my career.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.537
- And you let me and Karl touch that?
- Absolutely.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:45.872
What if we mess it up?

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.308
Josh, how much does this weigh?

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:49.642
Probably going to be 2-250.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:50.577
- Pounds?
- Yep.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.712
This is 1/10
the weight of Nolan's mom.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.347
God thatâ€™s wild!

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.182
Now, because this bone is
so ancient,

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.885
we have to cover it in a cast
before we pick it up.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:01.020
Or else it could
literally break in half.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:03.123
Let's hope it doesn't fall apart
when we lift it.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.458
One, two, three.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.094
Yes, highway baby.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.129
Good job.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.631
This is the first time any humans
have ever carried this bone.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.567
Just Youtubers carrying a dinosaur bone.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:16.803
Front of the table.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.472
One, two, lift.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:20.540
Watch your hand, Karl.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:23.877
And believe it or not,
this dinosaur bone did find

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.178
its way into a museum.

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:27.180
But because museums are boring.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.417
Let's head over to the $200,000 job,
astronaut training with NASA

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:32.652
and my first mission.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.088
Learn
to drive the official lunar rover.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.090
This is what will one day
be on the moon?

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.092
Yeah. This is how we're going to get
around the surface of the moon.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.727
Why are they letting me drive this?

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:42.061
Open the doors.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:44.898
How do I work this thing?

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.332
- Push forward on a stick.
- Right now?

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.967
Yeah, go for it.
Push forward.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:49.802
Jimmy, don't kill us.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:50.637
I'm scared.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:51.437
You good.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:52.672
Oh, this is amazing.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.407
- Go ahead and twist.
- To the right?

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.009
To the right or left, I don't care.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:57.110
Oh, my God. They're cars.

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:58.378
Is this street legal?

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.747
Street legal around here.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.048
Oh, this is amazing.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.249
Why are we driving sideways?

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.851
I haven't figured out
how to straight it yet.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.187
And even though I'm driving
like I'm actually drunk,

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.989
I still managed to get us to NASA's
lunar training yard,

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.591
where the real
test is going to be.

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:12.392
Oh, we're offroading.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:13.092
Oh, God.

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:14.527
Oh, it's getting bumpy.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.563
You're going to let me drive it
down this hill?

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.031
Is there seat belts in this thing?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.166
There's a seat belt
we don't use right there.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.602
They've got seat belts they don't use,
that's helpful

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:23.937
Oh, that's way too steep.

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:24.571
No way.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:25.605
Are we really going down?

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.307
Can I get that seat belt now?

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:28.741
Oh, my God.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.176
Wait, we're going down the hill sideways.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.344
Stop it, stop the car.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.879
Lift your hand
so they can see I'm driving.

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:34.981
He's actuallyâ€¦

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.482
I'll get up and let Nick-

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:37.483
No, sit there.

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:39.719
- Do I go sideways in the crater?
- Sure.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:41.321
Hold me, Karl.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:41.988
Hold me.

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:44.190
Lannan, I'm just going to say it,
you wouldn't survive on the moon.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.391
I reckon I could do it.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:46.259
Next in training,

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.429
NASA showed me around
their enormous space facility.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:50.430
Holy crap.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.799
This is the second
largest pool on Earth,

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.134
which, I'll be honest,
just felt like they were flexing on,

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.203
especially when they showed me
the space suit.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.238
As far as anybody is concerned,

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.939
once you try on a spacesuit,
you're an astronaut.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.341
But of course, there was a catch.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.243
When you go on a spacewalk,
do you have to wear a diaper?

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.078
You're in the suit for 12 hours.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:06.579
There you go.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.548
Like an actual real adult diaper, Okay.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.349
So be careful.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.650
This is a space artifact.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.685
It's flown on the space shuttle
several times.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.487
- So real astronauts have worn this.
- Yes.

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.022
Keep in mind
that astronaut peed in this.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.357
Have you peed in this suit?

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.524
I have not in the suit.

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:19.325
Okay.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.365
When's the next mission?

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:27.367
What are you doing a year from now?

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:29.569
- I can make time.
- Okay.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.672
And the final step of my training
was the craziest thing

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:33.573
I've ever done.

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:35.875
They were going to
let me touch the moon.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:36.476
No, no.

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:38.444
Lean back into it
because it weighs 9,000 pounds.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.712
This weighs 9,000 pounds.

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:42.215
Nice

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:43.950
This is the largest collection
of moon rocks

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.418
on display anywhere in the world.

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:47.086
I can't believe they letting us do this.

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.755
You realize, we're just a YouTube channel?

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:49.789
Yeah.

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:50.923
Oh, my God.

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.825
These are just straight up on the moon.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:55.161
What are the odds you'll
let me touch the Genesis Rock?

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:55.828
Zero.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.964
Yesterday,
we dug up a dinosaur fossils.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.966
I'm an expert in this kind of stuff.
Can I touch it?

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.167
- No.
- I tried.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.304
This material here
is actually lunar soil.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.672
No way bro.

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:07.206
So you're actually touching the moon
right now.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.408
Oh, that's wild.

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:10.677
So that tube has dirt from the moon

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:12.412
and has not been open since it came back.

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:14.681
And since you haven't checked,
in theory, there could be an alien.

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:15.348
Yes.

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.116
Well, it would be the first
from the moon.

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.851
- Wait, you guys heard that?
- From the moon? He said from the moon!

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:21.054
And after we
found out aliens are totally real,

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:23.222
we head into the stratosphere
for our next job

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:25.425
where Karl and Nolan
are going to fly a plane.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:27.927
- I've never flown a plane before.
- We have no idea what we're doing.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.829
Welcome to the first day of flight
training.

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:33.566
I'm not joking, for the boys
to somehow fly a real plane.

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.203
All they have to do is land
one time in this flight simulator

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:39.672
All right, here we have our throttle.
Pulling it back makes it go slower.

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:40.306
Just like that.

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:41.774
Oh. Oh, my God.

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.376
And after Nolan crashed.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:44.010
Oh, God.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.045
And crash. And crash.

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:48.047
You crashed the plane?!

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:50.917
He eventually did land successfully,
which, for whatever

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:53.920
reason, gave him the keys
to fly this real plane.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.221
Yo, I'm freaking out.

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:56.622
Hey, if you can't do this, Nolan, please

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.324
for love of God, let them know now.

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.260
Oh, my God. I'm
going to fly a plane.

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:02.295
Oh, my God.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.363
All right, you ready to go?

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.630
As ready as I'll ever be.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.933
- Full throttle.
- Approaching 60.

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:09.869
Kind of wobbly, but now,
just pull back a little bit.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.170
We're taking off.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.739
- There you go.
- Oh my God.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.374
Your life is in my hands.

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.609
He's literally controlling
this entire thing.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.177
Yes, he is, all by himself.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:20.146
Turbulence has never caused a crash, right?

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:22.515
Oh, well.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:24.016
Watch this, I'm going to turn right.

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:24.851
No.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.820
Turn right.
Oh my God, we're sideways.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.123
I can't believe that
I'm controlling this thing.

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:31.157
Look, no hands.

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:32.058
Stop.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:32.859
Oh, sweet Jesus.

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.161
You moron.
I'm going to murder you.

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:37.830
All right, we're going
to go over there in a minute,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.798
we're going
to go back and land.

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:39.999
Oh, my God.
I forgot.

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:42.535
That's the one thing,
it's always a challenge for people.

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:43.736
All right, I'm descending.

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.671
My mental health is descending also.

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:48.207
This is the part I crashed it
every time in the simulator.

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:49.409
Oh, God.

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:52.211
We're going to land right there
on top of that runway.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.513
Oh, my God.

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:55.715
Wait, we're too close, right?

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.850
Keep it pointed right down the middle.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.186
- Oh, my God.
- Easy.

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.655
Keep your hand on the throttle.

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.925
You're going to wait to pull back.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.326
Just breathe.

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:10.863
Here we go.

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.100
We touched ground.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.202
- You did it, man.
- I landed a plane.

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.270
Oh my God.

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.639
He said I couldn't do it,
but we're still here.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:20.773
You didn't kill me.

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:21.941
I was genuinely surprised

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:25.211
the job that pays
$1 million a year is hand modeling.

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:26.913
But only if you're
one of the highest paid

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.147
hand models in the world.

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:31.651
She makes five times the average
salary of a doctor by letting people

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:34.821
take photos of her hand
and her resume is stacked.

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:37.990
She's hand modeled for almost any
brand you've ever heard of.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.394
Her hands are even insured
for $1,000,000 per hand.

00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:42.962
I can't wait to see this in action.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.997
So to start us off,
she examined our hands.

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.934
I didn't know that today was going to be
the day that I'd find new insecurities.

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:50.436
Okay, so immediately
I can see the nails need work.

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:51.437
- Of course.
- I agreed.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.072
These
hands suck. Okay.

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:55.041
Look how much hair is here
compared to Karlâ€™s.

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.242
Can I get paid more for that?

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:58.744
The skin texture
might be better here with these two.

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.447
Can you change me?

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.815
I don't know if I can work miracles,

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.852
but I haven't seen your hands yet, Jimmy.

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.019
Your hands like glow.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:09.188
- That's crazy.
- Why are your hands so glossy?

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:11.357
I don't know.
Are my finger structures good?

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:13.493
Yeah, no they're
very good actually.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.162
But again, we've got cuticle issues,
skin issues here.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.196
But that can all be fixed.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.099
Our hands clearly needed work,
so we had to prepare them to shoot,

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:22.201
which was pretty easy
for me and Karl.

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:24.237
But for Lazar, not so much.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:24.904
Oh, God.

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:26.973
Bro, you can make
a rug out of all that hair.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.208
This hair has been with me my whole life,

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:31.477
but you got to do what you got to do
if you want to make a million dollars.

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:33.513
And now that my hands are no longer
disgusting,

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.515
we're going to model
for an actual magazine.

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:38.017
And these photos are literally going
to be shown on billboards

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.253
all across America
to promote these watches.

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:42.255
- That's petrifying.
- Yeah. No pressure.

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.123
Okay.

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:46.092
I mean, the watch looks good.

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:49.161
I honestly thought this was going
to be easy, but we were actually

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:50.263
horrible at this.

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:53.432
It looks like the watch is on a snake.

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:54.667
Bro, this is so hard.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:57.103
Can I see the difference with you
doing it?

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.572
- What?
- Unreal.

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:01.807
The product looks better because
your hand doesn't shake as much.

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:04.677
But being a hand model isn't
all about wearing nice watches.

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.879
Sometimes you have to model
weird things.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:07.613
Why are you squirming?

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:09.949
Because I see a man
holding a snake off camera.

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.518
Breathe, Karl. Breathe.

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:14.520
Put your other hand out here
and kind of support his head.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.354
Yeah, of course.

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:18.925
One final thing I need to throw in
the mix is Immortals of Aveum,

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:19.959
the sponsor of this video.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.360
Just hold that right there.
Okay, perfect.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.629
Now, he's modeling the watch, a snake

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:24.764
and this game.

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:26.666
Yo, look at that, that looks crazy.

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:29.402
Immortals of Aveum
is a first person magic shooter

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:32.572
where your player is a battle mage
named Jack trying to save the world, Karl.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:33.639
Can he save me?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.643
This time, I need you to model the Xbox
version of the game with a scorpion.

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:40.046
No way, bro.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.081
You want to grab between there and here.

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:43.382
Is this actually safe
for the animal?

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:44.550
Yes. Perfect. Perfect.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.219
Get it, get it. Go. Go. Talk,
talk and go and talk about the game.

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:49.422
You can sling 25 different types
of magic spells

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:50.990
and unlock 80 different talents

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.125
to customize your character
to suit your play style.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:55.595
Karl, you think Immortals of Aveum
is going to love that photo?

00:09:55.661 --> 00:09:57.196
Immortals of Aveum, I hope you love this.

00:09:57.196 --> 00:10:00.600
Karl, just hold the scary animals
and then, we get to go be NFL players.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:03.502
The people who created Immortals of Aveum
also helped make

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:07.440
the award-winning campaigns
of Halo, Call of Duty and Dead Space.

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:08.774
We love those campaigns.

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:10.943
Oh, it's moving.

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:13.613
And the cool thing is they put me in
the game as a boss.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.448
And if you kill me in the game,
you get more gold

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.083
than any other boss
the game gives you.

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:19.952
Nah, I got you. I got you.
Just don't look.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.188
Immortals of Aveum

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:25.257
is out now with a free trial on Xbox
as well as PS5.

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:27.526
And there's a free demo
available on Steam.

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:28.861
I feel it under me.

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:29.729
It's under my hands.

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:31.230
We were doing such a bad job

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.332
that we had the hand
model step in to ensure

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:34.967
the sponsor would
approve of the photos.

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:36.102
Click the link in the description.

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:38.337
If you want to play Immortals of Aveum
right now.

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:39.605
I'm retiring as a hand model,

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:41.240
and even though
our photos weren't great,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.509
we still got them on billboards
across the country.

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:45.444
And now it was finally time

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:48.614
for the job that pays
$10 million per year.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:49.248
That's right.

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:52.118
I'm about to literally join the NFL.

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:53.853
This is literally my dream.

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.421
And if you think this is all fake,

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:58.724
here I am signing a real contract
to become a literal player

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:01.627
for the Buccaneers
worth $10 million.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.362
It might say we're not going to pay it,

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:05.031
but it at least says that dollar amount.

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.265
No, no, focus on the dollar amount.

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:08.067
And now it's official.
Congratulations.

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:10.536
So for the next 48 hours,
I'm officially a player.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:11.671
You are officially a player.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.872
I promise I won't let you down.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.640
I promise he will let you down.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:15.841
By the end of my contract

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:16.842
I'm going to be running out

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:20.413
with the team on the field
in front of 60,000 fans.

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:22.048
First step is weight training.

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:23.315
It might be too light, let's go up.

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:24.250
Let's go up. Easy.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.185
I don't actually think
they're paying me the 10 million.

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:27.119
Easy! Easy!

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:29.522
Are you a winner or are you a Falcon?

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:30.990
Easy.

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:31.657
Yeah!

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.393
I notice they yell at you a lot
when you're an NFL player.

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:37.063
Can you set it to whatever the
strongest player in your team does?

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:38.798
I'm going to see if I can do one.

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.068
He can do 12 of these?

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:43.002
Holy crap.

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:44.236
He's not a normal human.

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:46.038
I would hate to be hit by him.

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.506
- One more!
- Yeah!

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.241
- Football!
- Easy!

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:50.309
Come on.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.878
Why is the NFL so hard?

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:56.048
How is this compared
to their typical workouts?

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:56.882
It's pretty pathetic.

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.417
Hopefully the lightheadedness goes
away.

00:11:58.451 --> 00:11:59.418
It will. You get used to it.

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:00.019
Okay.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:03.155
Up next was my first practice
at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:05.491
training facility.
So naturally I met my coach.

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:07.293
Hello MrBeast! I'm the coach.
How you doing?

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:07.760
Good!

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:09.295
And my new teammates.

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:10.129
Nice to meet you, man.

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:10.896
My name's Shaq.

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:11.731
My kids love you.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:12.898
I love your videos.

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.600
the candy bars, the Karl Gummies.

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:15.668
Oh really?

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:16.936
Yeah!

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.003
And my new teammates couldn't

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:20.139
believe that
I actually signed with the team,

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:22.007
so I showed them
my contract to prove it.

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:23.542
This is the same one
you guys signed?

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:26.145
You got more money than me though.
I ain't getting much

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:28.414
But if you read it says
"Unless it's canceled in 48 hours..."

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:29.415
We're still going to cancel. Yeah.
Look at the five.

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:31.117
Y'all look at the parentheses for sure.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.685
Hey, you're official.
Welcome to the team.

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.687
- Thank you. My new teammates over here.
- You got to work hard.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.122
These guys
make us look like children.

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:38.657
They're so big.
Look at the size comparison.

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:40.793
I'll be honest, I've never

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:43.763
played football before, so
they threw me on as kicker, which...

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:45.965
I was terrible at.

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:48.400
Mr. Beast, we need you out here!
We got to get ready for tomorrow.

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.935
You're right.
You're right. You're. I'll QB.

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:52.338
And since I've never played
quarterback before either.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:55.274
I just threw it up
as far as I could.

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:58.310
That's touchdown.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.212
In case you didn't know, the team
I just joined

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:02.848
is the same team
Tom Brady won the Super Bowl with,

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:04.817
so I thought it'd be funny
to surprise him.

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:06.352
Oh, we got him, Tom.

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:07.386
Oh, I almost got hit.

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:08.654
TB, what's up baby?

00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:09.955
- What's up, TB?
- What's up, bro?

00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:11.390
How my boys doing?

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:14.760
I have a friend here
who might literally die of happiness

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.694
if you say hi to him.

00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:17.730
You can't do this to me.
You can't do this to me.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:18.998
Lannan, I love you, bro.

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.132
I'm dead.

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.569
After that, our practice
just devolved into shenanigans.

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:25.738
Little man.

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.641
- Tareq.
- Too small, yeah.

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:29.842
You could go back to filming.

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:31.277
All right, guys. See y'all.

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:33.913
Some people still have some
questions about my two day contract.

00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:36.482
So afterwards the Bucs
set up a press conference for me.

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:37.650
We obviously have a big game.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.552
I'm expecting very serious questions only.

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:42.054
Is this just a publicity stunt?
Why are you really here?

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:43.522
To make the best video possible.

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:46.826
Yes, it's a publicity stunt
I clearly am not an NFL player.

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.694
Jimmy, how does it feel
being on a new team?

00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:50.029
It feels great, to be honest.

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:51.997
They've accepted me way more than
I thought.

00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:53.933
How much playing time are you expecting?

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:54.733
None.

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.702
And after
explaining over and over again

00:13:56.702 --> 00:13:58.771
that it's just a stunt,
I went to go get measured.

00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:00.472
Six foot four and a half.

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:01.507
Six, four and a half?

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.908
Karl, you're six five.

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:04.243
- I'm six five. Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:06.545
These measurements are key

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:09.481
so that my gear and my uniform
are all custom fitting.

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:12.051
- This actually looks so good.
- There we go.

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:15.254
And now that I'm suited up,
it's time for the official game day.

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:17.256
I still don't know why
they're letting me do this.

00:14:17.289 --> 00:14:18.390
But hey, thanks, Bucs.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.259
Are you surprised
they let me join the team?

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:21.193
Yes.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.928
That's my first football
I've ever signed.

00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:25.164
Jimmy's about to come out any second now.

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:27.132
They say if you get up by 100,
I can play a play.

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:29.101
Do me a favor and get up super hot.

00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:30.069
Sounds good.

00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:32.504
It's his first game and probably
his last.

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.206
Definitely his last.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.374
How is this happening?

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:36.709
Fire

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:38.577
the cannons!

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:39.511
That's great...

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:43.749
And since this is the only
NFL game I'll ever be a part of,

00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:45.985
the team, actually,
let me lead them out the tunnel.

00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:46.919
Let's go, boys.

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:51.523
Yeah!

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.559
- Jimmy!
- That's our friend.

00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:57.229
Let's not get run over by the players.

00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:58.931
Yeah!

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.200
Is it the best day of your life?

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.202
This is the best day of
my life, Jimmy. I love you.

00:15:03.202 --> 00:15:04.770
We're getting passed by the players.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.572
Jimmy's an NFL player.

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:09.008
- How's it going?
- Let's go, Bucks.

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:11.977
I won't let you guys down,
even though I probably won't get play time.

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:13.979
- I love America.
- That's a big plane!

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:15.180
America.

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:18.183
Let's play football. Yeah!

00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:21.987
Huge shout out to the Buccaneers
for making me an official NFL player.

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:23.923
It's honestly
a good thing that I didn't play

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.225
because if they hit me,
I probably would have died.

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:29.361
And I thought it was all over there
until the Falcons tweeted this.

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:32.298
So, in retaliation,
I'm nuking their stadium.
