00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
- All right, you have $1,300 to spend

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.223
on an Android slab phone in 2024.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.480
Why would you get any other phone?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.030
No, seriously, why would
you get any other phone?

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.490
This S 24 Ultra has taken the best things

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.500
from every other ultra high-end phone

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.600
and stuffed them into one place,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.570
so anything that you could possibly value,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.070
it has pushed to the max.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.860
And there's just multiple cherries on top,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.960
just sprinkled all over the place.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.032
This phone sets the tone for 2024.

00:00:30.032 --> 00:00:33.032
(soft upbeat music)

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:43.350
So the formula for Samsung's Ultra phones

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.300
has evolved a little bit over the years.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.580
At first, it was just the most numbers,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.640
the biggest megapixel count,
the most zoom and all that.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.050
Then it added the S Pen

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.350
and got a little more refined
and it replaced the Note.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.170
Now it's just everything.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.280
It's just everything in one place.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.690
It's all the best hardware,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.810
all the best software I can
think of all in one phone.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.120
So on the outside, like I
said in my early impressions,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.210
this phone looks almost the
same as last year's phone,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.860
but if you think this
phone is almost the same

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.740
as last year's phone, turns
out you're missing a lot.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.180
So the more you use this phone,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.890
the more you look for weaknesses,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.300
the more impressive it gets.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.133
So maybe what?

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.970
You're a screen snob, right?

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.170
You like to pixel peep,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.003
maybe you were thinking about

00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:26.190
getting one of the ultra
high-end Oppo or Xiaomi phones

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.010
just for an amazing screen.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.410
All right, well, look no further.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.090
Literally one of the best
screens than any phone.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.940
S24 Ultra has dropped in a class leading

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.420
6.8 inch quad HD AMOLED
display and it is awesome.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.320
These ultra phones have
had 120Hz LTPO for a while

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.600
and they've been this really sharp quad HD

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.620
for a while now too.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.420
But now on top of that, two new things,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.930
one is it's completely flat
and two is its much brighter.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.730
So there's been this whole new batch

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.219
of like 2,500 plus nit phones

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.170
in the past couple months that I've seen.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.920
This I think is the best looking
one that I've seen so far.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.130
So now it's up to a max 2,600 nits,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.440
which is awesome outdoors or anywhere.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.600
But it also gets extremely
dim at night too,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.770
without any of the weird banding

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.880
I've seen in some other phones.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.800
And they flattened the display completely

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.080
and brought the display
right up to the very corners

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.610
with some of the thinnest
bezels we've seen

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.443
all the way around.

00:02:18.443 --> 00:02:20.880
Plus there's also this new
anti-reflective coating

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.290
on this Gorilla Glass Armor

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.820
that makes a noticeable difference

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.460
with certain light hitting
it at off axis angles.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.790
And then there is a crazy fast
ultrasonic fingerprint reader

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.050
underneath to top it all off.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.580
And you know, maybe I
wish the touch target

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.740
was a little bit bigger,
but that's about it.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.450
Honestly, if you're a screen snob,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.610
it doesn't really get better
than this one right here.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.290
This is the phone you should get.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.230
Okay, so what if your primary
concern is battery life?

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.150
Well, you could always
get the Energizer phone

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.470
that we saw at CES at one time,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.830
but as far as reasonably
sized flagship slab phones go,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.540
it doesn't get much better than this.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.970
Again, they're keeping a 5,000mAh battery

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.980
in one of the best
performing battery phones

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.060
from the past two years,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.910
despite making it thinner
and keeping the S Pen.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.530
So you might as well get this one.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.630
Still got 45 watt wired charging,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.660
you still have 25 watt wireless charging

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.250
and just battery life-wise,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.860
I was able to have long
days with no problems,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.480
with six hours plus screen on time.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.080
I was able to baby it into
getting two full days,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.080
that's at 1440p, at 120Hz
and with high brightness use.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.060
So yeah, Why get anything else?

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.330
So okay, what if then
it's just performance

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.793
is the main thing that you care about.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.130
Okay, so we're seeing all these phones

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.350
with the Snapdragon 8 Gen
3 starting to come out

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.790
and they're looking really good.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.110
Great high-end performance,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.090
there's efficiency gains
all over the place,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.850
plus this phone pairs
it with 12 gigs of RAM

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.380
and it is a multitasking champ.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.510
And if it's a stylus
you're into, I already know

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.610
you aren't really
considering any other phone,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.760
the S Pen is basically
the only high-end stylus

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.590
still going in slab smartphones.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.740
It's really good for note-taking,
drawing, highlighting,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.573
all that stuff.

00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:58.290
But if you're like me and
you hardly ever use that,

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.180
there's still the gaming performance

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.530
and the everyday performance.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.330
There's the newly added rate tracing

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.600
plus a 90% larger vapor
chamber to cool the phone

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.680
for much longer stuff.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.150
Turns out it's an A plus.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.150
Now you could always get a gaming phone

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.780
and squeeze five to 10% more frames

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.060
out of a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.150
with some huge badass cooling
setup, and that's great,

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.030
but then you also have to
accept all of the sacrifices

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.840
that come with said
gaming phone over this.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.523
And do you really want
those extra frames that bad?

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.100
Depends on who you ask.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.350
Okay, cameras, there's a lot
of other phones out there

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.690
that you could buy if your 1,300 bucks

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.210
specifically has to go
to the best cameras.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.220
You know the Pixel just
won the blind camera test.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.960
Sony has the best manual mode,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.520
like there's other great camera systems.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.480
But here's a way to simplify it,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.430
I think in evaluating smartphone cameras,

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.550
there's basically two ways to review them.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.480
There's the utility, the
actual technical evaluation,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.480
and the aesthetics, the art
of it, the subjectivity part.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.150
And I think utility-wise,
like on paper, specs-wise,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.050
this camera's got it all.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.400
Like you've seen this camera array before,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.560
there's four cameras on
the back of this phone.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.360
Turns out, they're
basically the same cameras

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.850
as last year's S23 Ultra except for one.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.550
So there's a primary camera, an ultra wide

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.680
and a pair of two different
telephoto cameras.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.200
The primary camera is still the ridiculous

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.530
200 megapixel sensor with
all the same pros and cons.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.230
It's consistent and
versatile across the board.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.880
It has great dynamic range.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.950
It's a quick shooter with quick auto focus

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.470
and it's also always bending
down to 12 megapixels

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.600
and you should almost never switch it

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.400
to the 200 megapixel mode

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.170
unless you have incredible lighting.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.130
It has an ultra wide

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.690
with a bit of distortion near the edges,

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.430
but it's actually meaningfully wider

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.860
than the primary camera, so
it's really fun to shoot with.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.620
Even though the automatic
macro mode from it

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.080
looks like trash and you
should just turn it off

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.040
anytime it turns your pictures
from this to this, pro tip.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.740
And then it has a medium
range, 3X telephoto camera

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.710
that kicks in smoothly and
matches the colors and exposure

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.330
from the main camera really well.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.460
And so the one new thing
in hardware this year

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.240
is they've gone from a
10 megapixel, 10X camera

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.290
to a 50 megapixel 5X camera.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.470
So technically, shorter
optical zoom range,

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.150
but I would say with the extra resolution,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.460
it is actually more powerful.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.150
It means all the photos in
the gap between 5X and 10X

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.590
look sharper than last year.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.290
And then you can literally put
the 10X photos side by side

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.600
from the S23 Ultra and the S24 Ultra

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.230
and the new 5X cropped
in actually looks better.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.820
Plus you can still zoom all the way in

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.220
and shoot at a 100X if
you still wanna take

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.990
ultra stable pictures of far
away objects like the moon.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.450
But basically what I'm
saying is utility-wise,

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.060
this camera system
checks every single box.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.260
It has everything.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.490
So from there

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.230
you get into the more
subjective aesthetic differences

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.110
which you could always
lean one way or the other.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.910
I think, I mean, looking at these photos,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.730
they're still very much Samsung's

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.130
slightly extra process-looking,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.860
a little bit extra contrasty,
a little bit higher exposure,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.030
a little brighter colors,

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.590
that still happens with these photos.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.060
So you could still convince yourself

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.420
to lean Pixel or even iPhone,

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.110
but if you just wanna be able
to check every single box,

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.280
why look anywhere else?

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.960
Honestly, the changes that you notice more

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.670
aside from the actual camera quality

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.260
are just like features using it.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Like the S24 Ultra shoots
everything HDR by default now,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.020
it's actually in Google's
new ultra HDR format.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.090
So when you have specular highlights

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.580
or big dynamic range
differences in a photo,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.700
it will tastefully crank up that stuff

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.670
for a more dramatic looking
picture on the phone screen,

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.800
similar to what Pixel
and iPhone already do.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.160
And this passes through all the
way from capturing the photo

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
to viewing it in the gallery,
and then one more step,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.260
to actually publishing it on social media.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.740
So Samsung has worked with
Instagram and Snapchat

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.860
for native quality photo and
video uploading pipelines

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.540
because at the end of the
day, once you take the photo,

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.350
what are you 99% of the
time planning to do with it?

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.183
Share it.

00:08:05.183 --> 00:08:07.230
And I think this is important
for a lot of people,

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:11.790
one of the reasons I have
carried an iPhone for years

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.170
is one of the things
you can always count on

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.110
is the photos and videos
in third party apps

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.250
are going to look just as good

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.530
as if they were captured
in the main camera.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.110
And now you can actually
say that that is true now

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.470
about photos and videos from this phone,

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.050
at least in Instagram and Snapchat.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.540
All right, maybe you're a software person,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.180
maybe the top of your list
when buying a new smartphone

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.460
is you want the smartest smartphone.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.180
It's gotta have all the
software and AI features.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.210
And honestly, it should have a
nice long roadmap ahead of it

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.150
of on-time software updates,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.340
sounds like I'm describing a Pixel

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.730
but turns out, this phone now has a ton,

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.240
a ton of helpful AI features built-in

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.110
that are actually good,

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.880
they make a meaningful
difference to everyday use.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.110
Now the funny part about a lot of this

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.300
is a lot of these features are made

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.510
in partnership with Google, as you'll see.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.920
And I can't help but keep thinking

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.310
like it feels like Samsung needs Google

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.770
to have all of these
features in their phone

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.260
to compete especially against the iPhone.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.550
But then Google,

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.490
now their own phones are a
little bit less competitive,

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.590
but it's probably worth the trade off

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.690
because now technically
they're helping to compete

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.680
against the iPhone.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.180
It's this weird like thing
where they need each other.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.740
I think it's fascinating

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.630
and probably worth its own separate video,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.740
maybe let me know with a comment

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.290
or by subscribing if
you'd be down to see that.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.120
But that's all the
background, all of this.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.160
So we were just talking
about photos a second ago,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.960
the second you're done taking a photo

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.880
and opening it up in
Samsung's Gallery app,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.950
there's a ton of useful AI driven stuff

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:41.790
that you can do with it.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.040
And it's kinda all based
on what sort of scene

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.690
it auto detects that you've taken.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.540
So lots of photos just end
up with a remaster button

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.610
where you click it and then
it can add some contrast

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.230
and brighten things up
a little bit as needed

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.240
and gives you a solid before and after.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.630
But if your photo has
some glass or a window,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.180
it'll show you an Erase Reflections button

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.350
and then you can literally go in

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.330
and circle the reflections
you wanna get rid of

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.800
and it'll generative fill

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.930
what should actually be in the glass.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.950
And it works pretty well.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.290
Now with this photo, I didn't
take it in portrait mode

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.120
but it's recognized that there's a subject

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.640
and so it'll offer to add background blur.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.470
And even without a bunch
of extra depth information,

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.170
it analyzes the subject and
it lets me add a little bit

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.790
or a lot of background blur

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.670
with a pretty good cutout, if you ask me,

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.710
to just create a portrait
mode shot out of thin air.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.200
But if you ever really,
really wanna go crazy,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.630
there's a whole separate Magic Editor

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.200
that feels exactly like what
we just got with the Pixel

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.689
minus any restrictions,

00:10:35.689 --> 00:10:38.220
it's never told me it can't do something.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.530
So you open any photo,
hit that Edit button,

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.370
and then there's this little

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.440
blue green button with the stars,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.780
that's Samsung's new Magic Editor.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.600
And once you're here,
you can just go nuts.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.910
You can move the subject around a photo

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.860
and have a generative
fill in the background.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.200
Or you can have it remove things entirely

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.240
from the foreground or
the background of a photo,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.730
like photo bombers or just
unnecessary random objects.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.230
I actually found this super useful.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.240
But probably actually my
favorite one, underrated,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.000
you know how normally when
you need to tilt a photo,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.670
like fix the horizon,
you end up cropping in

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.620
and losing some of the
outside of the photo?

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.990
You can still do that but
with this Magic Editor,

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.970
you can open it up and tilt the horizon

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.400
to whatever angle you want,
and instead of cropping,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.030
it will literally generative
fill in the outsides

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.790
of the photo, which works very well

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.200
because usually the outside of the photo

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.760
is the least important part of the photo.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.320
You can get away with generative fill.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.690
And by the way, literally all
this stuff works with photos

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.950
you download to the phone too,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.990
not just photos you've
taken on the camera,

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.320
but photos you just get
wherever just like the Pixel.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.670
Now I also find it hilarious

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.730
that if you use the Magic
Editor to alter a photo

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.470
on this phone, it'll
add a little watermark

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.690
to the bottom corner
with these little stars

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.170
so that you know that this
photo was AI manipulated,

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.180
which is good, that's a good
responsible thing to do,

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.280
especially if you're gonna
upload this to social media.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.350
But then you can also
immediately erase that watermark

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.630
with a built-in object removal tool

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.070
in Samsung's Photo Editor app.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.780
There's a nice little
section in the settings

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.770
where Samsung's tucked all of
the AI features of this phone.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.480
It's called Advanced Intelligence,

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.040
instead of artificial intelligence.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.570
Still AI though.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.530
That's where you get stuff like

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.890
the live phone call translation feature

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.240
or the new Voice Recorder app

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.950
getting much improved speaker labels

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.110
and summaries and transcriptions.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.560
The Samsung Browser will now
do summaries of webpages.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.360
This might all sound very familiar,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.020
but the best new one in my
opinion is Circle to Search.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.350
Now Google Lens has been
around for a long time,

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.050
in my opinion, one of Google's
most underrated products.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.160
So people might have already known

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.900
that you could basically do this already,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.700
but it would take several steps.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.490
Circle to Search, just makes it one step.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.010
It's much faster, it's pretty awesome.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.440
You literally just hold
down on the home button

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.380
or the gesture bar at the
bottom and then circle or tap

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.510
whatever on your screen
that you wanna Google search

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.070
and it just immediately Googles

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.630
over the top of whatever you were doing

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.790
without leaving that
app and it's so useful.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.860
Just, even during the week
I've been using this phone,

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.620
I've searched pictures,
parts of pictures before,

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.000
it almost always works,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.650
just like uploading it to Google Lens.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.660
I've searched objects right in front of me

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.010
through the camera view finder.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.990
I've searched random landmarks.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.250
You can also search text

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.400
and you can even append
text to your search.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.440
And I was just constantly
impressed by how fast it is,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.050
and it basically works as
expected every single time.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.070
The one fidgety part is
sometimes selecting text

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.480
gets a little weird.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.760
Using the S Pen can
solve that a little bit

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.110
to just get a more precise selection.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.340
But yeah, once you do it,

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.860
it's much faster than if
you're gonna use Google Lens,

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.240
having to like take a screenshot

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.590
and then upload it through Lens

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.170
and then maybe have to crop
it and the whole thing.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.760
This is just fast.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.640
Now real OGs will know that
there used to be a feature

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.400
on Pixels called Now on Tap.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.680
It was like the same exact
thing, hold the home button

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.870
and it would just Google
whatever was on your screen

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.510
and help you out but that
was everything on your screen

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.730
and they kinda ended up wrapping
that into Google Assistant.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.010
This is just so much
faster and more selective.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.670
Also, Pixels are gonna get
this feature very soon as well.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.980
But then bonus points, if
you really love software,

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.980
Samsung is now promising seven
years of security updates

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.520
and seven generations of
major software updates

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.190
on this phone, on this S24 lineup.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.500
I assume seven generations
of software updates

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.660
is basically seven years.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.590
That means this phone will
be up to date in 2031.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.423
Loving that.

00:14:23.423 --> 00:14:26.430
So we know the common wisdom
was that if you wanted four,

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.620
five, six plus years of software updates

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.410
or if you want every single
little software and AI feature,

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:35.130
you basically had to go iPhone or Pixel.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.580
But now that this phone also has that,

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.230
why get anything else?

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.360
But speaking of the iPhone,
they're going at them too.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.567
Now I know I said in the
beginning of this video,

00:14:43.567 --> 00:14:48.567
$1,300 slab Android phone, so
I know the iPhone 15 Pro Max

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.990
was never really on the table,
but if we're being honest,

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.080
Samsung has never been shy
about competing directly

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.460
against the iPhone,

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.120
so why not take some of the
best stuff from there too?

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.200
They weren't being subtle about it.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.680
So they've got this shiny
brand new titanium color

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.950
with titanium rails on the S24
Ultra, just like the iPhone.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.900
They have flatten the screen and the sides

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.300
and made boxier corners all
the way through the lineup,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.260
just like the iPhone.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.290
They have moved to a max 5X telephoto lens

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.330
like I talked about earlier,
also just like the iPhone.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.190
They also have this new always on display

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.420
that doesn't just show the time

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.100
but shows your whole wallpaper now,

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.320
kinda like it's half awake
just like the iPhone.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.640
Thankfully, you can also turn that off

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.680
and save some battery,
just like the iPhone.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.340
You can also now long press
to select an object in a photo

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.010
that automatically cuts it
out and makes it a sticker

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.080
you can use in other apps,
just like the iPhone.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.810
And there's even these new
lock screen widgets now

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.380
that look exactly like the iPhones,

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.580
like copy my homework

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.740
but don't even worry if
they know you copied it.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.540
These two are gonna
keep copying each other

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.910
till the end of time, none
of this is a surprise,

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.520
it's just at the end of the
day we are technically winning

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.050
because they're making each other

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.700
a little bit better bit by bit.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.460
But at the end of the day, S24 Ultra,

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.650
I really do feel like,

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.207
it feels like peak slab phone.

00:16:03.207 --> 00:16:04.590
And there's also a whole bunch of stuff

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.240
I didn't even really
mention with this phone.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.847
The haptics are really nice,
I didn't even get to that.

00:16:08.847 --> 00:16:10.620
Now there's AI generated wallpapers,

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.540
a whole section for 'em,
if you're into that.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.470
And it's nice that the AI stuff
is mostly kinda tucked away

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.150
in ways where you don't
ever have to use it

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.990
if you don't want to,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.700
but if you notice it
and it's helpful to you,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.830
bam, turn it on, could
be your favorite feature.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.420
Really the only things that I miss,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.520
from the Pixel specifically,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.150
are Call Screening and Now Playing.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.230
So really the best argument
not to buy this $1,300 phone

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.870
is the fact that it's a $1,300 phone.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.320
And the truth is you
can get 98% of the phone

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.280
for much less money.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.780
You can see it in Samsung's own lineup.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:47.780
Samsung's own S24 Plus
has a 4,900mAh battery

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.050
instead of a 5,000.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.620
It has a 6.7 inch display instead of 6.8

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.470
and it drops the S Pen and
one of the telephoto cameras

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.440
for $300 off.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.530
And you know you can get the regular S24,

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.110
again, for much less money
with almost as much phone.

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:07.050
So you don't have to spend
1,300 bucks on a phone.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.760
But if you are going to,

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.920
and you put the word Ultra in the name

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.200
and you stuff as much stuff in one phone

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.620
as you possibly can, this is
the one that you should get.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.970
This has all the things;

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.190
it's reliable, it's
fast, it does everything,

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.910
it checks all the boxes, it sounds great.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.590
It kinda feels like an ad when I just say

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:28.680
all these positive things
about the phone but it's not.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.440
Until right now, this video
is sponsored by Ridge.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.690
The Ridge Wallet is iconic at this point.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.370
It's a minimalist, modern wallets

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.530
like the opposite of
those old school wallets.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.290
It's got the patented dual
track design that expands

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.560
to hold one to 12 cards while
being as slim as possible.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.470
And at this point, there's
like 30 plus different colors

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.130
and styles including carbon
fiber, burnt titanium

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.300
and forged ember.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.530
This one is the forged ember,

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.020
so it's got these little red
flex in it, which look cool.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.340
You can also get accessories for it,

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.220
so if you wanna carry cash,
you might want the money clip

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.170
or this one has the cash strap.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.670
Or if you want the Air Tag holder,

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.290
you can get one that
holds in the Air Tag to it

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.400
so you never lose your wallet.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.233
And on top of all that,

00:18:06.233 --> 00:18:07.440
if you get one and you don't like it,

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.320
you can return it within 99
days, no questions asked.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.340
So if you wanna grab one,

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.830
you can get 10% off using code MKBHD

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.830
or go to ridge.com/mkbhd.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.210
Tell 'em I sent you.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:22.500
Either way, that's been
it for the S24 Ultra.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.210
Thanks for watching.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.979
Catch you guys on the next one, peace.

00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:29.848
(soft upbeat music)
