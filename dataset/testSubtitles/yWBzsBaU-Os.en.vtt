00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.360
Many people claim to be gaming on a potato,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.840
but very few have the spuds to actually do it.

00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:09.576
And I know what you guys are thinking.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.316
Linus, it's easy.

00:00:11.316 --> 00:00:14.156
You just mash a little bitty Raspberry Pi

00:00:14.156 --> 00:00:15.676
into a

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:18.656
there, and boom, it's done.

00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:20.116
But come on.

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:21.416
That's small fries.

00:00:21.416 --> 00:00:23.676
We want the full starch experience.

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:27.036
Friends, I am talking a full Windows PC in one of these.

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:28.616
And since it's a plant,

00:00:28.616 --> 00:00:31.496
well, it's gonna need to be watered.

00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:34.576
Which, oh God, we're liquid cooling it?

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:35.956
That's just the beginning.

00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:36.916
When we're done,

00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:38.916
this potato is gonna play Baldur's Gate 3,

00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:43.036
Cyberpunk, Halo Infinite, and Sponsor Segue Simulator 2000.

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:44.836
Oh, I love that game!

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.436
Almost as much as I love

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:47.276
Thorum.

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:49.796
Their rings and watches are made from unique materials

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:53.376
like Gibeon meteorite and ethical, naturally shed antlers.

00:00:53.376 --> 00:00:54.336
Check them out at the link below

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:56.960
and use code LTT for 20% off.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.200
Our biggest problem for this project, ironically,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.120
is that potatoes are very small.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.200
So initially, we set out to find bigger potatoes,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.680
but in spite of some promising leads,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.580
finding one big enough to fit a full-fat gaming system

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.300
was a fruitless endeavor.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.240
Get it?

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.400
Even our hand-selected Super Spuds are much smaller

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.240
than a standard Mini-ITX motherboard,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.360
so we turned our attention to finding a smaller computer.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.920
And that we did.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.420
Meet the Minisforum EM680.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.340
It's got eight Zen 3 Plus cores

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.620
that turbo up to 4.7 gigahertz

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.260
and Radeon 680M RDNA3 graphics.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.640
It's shockingly powerful for such a small package.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.680
The whole package is just 10 Pringles tall.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.520
We're gonna have a link below

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.840
if you wanna pick up one of your own.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.960
Of course, even at that size, it's not small enough for us.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.080
So we'll be taking it apart with this

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.980
prototype LTT precision screwdriver,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.680
complete with bit storage and hybrid ceramic bearing top.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.660
Yes. Yes, you will.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.500
Sign up for a notification at lttstore.com.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.800
Gotta love that.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.960
Nice, strong magnet.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.700
I couldn't believe how small this computer was.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.420
Originally, we had another Minisforum

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.360
that is about 14 centimeters, both directions.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.000
And that was small to me.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.980
But when we got this one in, I was blown away.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.940
I didn't know computers came this small.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.780
This is tiny.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.120
So small.

00:02:24.224 --> 00:02:26.864
This is actually the power of a gaming PC

00:02:26.864 --> 00:02:28.404
in the palm of my hand.

00:02:28.404 --> 00:02:30.584
Now I've got the power of this cooling solution

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:31.784
in the palm of my hand here.

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:33.084
Okay, pop that out.

00:02:33.084 --> 00:02:37.464
Oh, liquid metal on the stock cooling solution.

00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:40.684
After the issues we had with it on custom builds,

00:02:40.684 --> 00:02:42.964
I just never thought this stuff would go mainstream.

00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:45.244
But with the right protective measures,

00:02:45.244 --> 00:02:47.284
like these covers for the surface mount components

00:02:47.284 --> 00:02:48.504
and these gaskets,

00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:50.324
it seems like manufacturers can make it work,

00:02:50.324 --> 00:02:52.496
even big ones like Asus and Sony.

00:02:52.496 --> 00:02:55.296
It really does help you get the most out of a small cooling
solution.

00:02:55.296 --> 00:03:00.416
Of course, we apparently will not be using this one because we like
playing on hard mode.

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:08.416
Hey, there we go. Oh, cool.

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:10.396
They've got a main board up here

00:03:10.396 --> 00:03:11.976
and then they've got a daughterboard down here

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:13.336
that's handling all of the IO,

00:03:13.336 --> 00:03:15.436
including the micro SD slot.

00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:18.536
IO is gonna be a challenge, huh?

00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:20.156
USB4 is truly incredible.

00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:23.016
We actually only really need two USB4s to go in,

00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:25.276
one for power and one that's gonna go to a dongle

00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:26.176
for everything else.

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:27.836
Now that we've got the whole thing apart,

00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:30.416
I can show you how the two boards go back together.

00:03:30.416 --> 00:03:31.696
There we go.

00:03:31.696 --> 00:03:33.336
And that's it.

00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:36.768
CPU, 32 gigs, LPDDR5 memory.

00:03:36.768 --> 00:03:40.668
A terabyte of PCIe gen four storage and even USB four.

00:03:40.668 --> 00:03:43.308
So we could hook up an external GPU to this thing

00:03:43.308 --> 00:03:45.208
if we really wanted to.

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:46.048
We don't want to though,

00:03:46.048 --> 00:03:47.888
because we want it all to fit in here.

00:03:47.888 --> 00:03:50.228
So without further ado,

00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:53.208
let's throw this little guy into the frying pan.

00:03:53.208 --> 00:03:56.568
Figuratively of course, unless?

00:03:57.928 --> 00:03:59.528
Now that we found a computer small enough,

00:03:59.528 --> 00:04:01.268
we need to select our potato.

00:04:01.268 --> 00:04:02.568
Oh, any one of these is fine?

00:04:02.568 --> 00:04:03.688
Any of these should do.

00:04:03.688 --> 00:04:06.088
I think there's some that are better candidates.

00:04:06.088 --> 00:04:06.640
Let's try this one.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.480
She's soft though. How long have we had these potatoes? About a
month. They're a little old.

00:04:12.592 --> 00:04:14.772
How about this guy?

00:04:14.772 --> 00:04:15.932
That's pretty, that's a pretty good size.

00:04:15.932 --> 00:04:17.432
He's got a nice regal shape to him.

00:04:17.432 --> 00:04:19.132
The, it kind of looks like you.

00:04:20.392 --> 00:04:21.592
Never thought I'd be asking this,

00:04:21.592 --> 00:04:23.992
but what's our plan for potato carving?

00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:26.772
My original plan was to slice the potato in half

00:04:26.772 --> 00:04:28.932
and then just scoop it out with an ice cream scoop.

00:04:28.932 --> 00:04:29.772
Oh yeah, pumpkin style.

00:04:29.772 --> 00:04:32.052
That's what I did in all, exactly, all my testing.

00:04:32.052 --> 00:04:32.892
Okay.

00:04:35.272 --> 00:04:36.692
David's getting a cutting board right now,

00:04:36.692 --> 00:04:39.092
but the way I see it, it's not necessary.

00:04:39.092 --> 00:04:40.452
Not for a fruit ninja like me.

00:04:40.452 --> 00:04:42.552
Damn, I actually kind of nailed that.

00:04:42.552 --> 00:04:45.792
This cutting board is much fancier than I expected.

00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:46.632
Oh, wow.

00:04:46.632 --> 00:04:48.392
Full swag, Corsair.

00:04:48.392 --> 00:04:51.672
Anyway, which way do you find it's best?

00:04:51.672 --> 00:04:52.812
There's no method to this madness.

00:04:52.812 --> 00:04:53.892
It's just madness.

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:55.452
You'll want to be careful when you get close to the edges.

00:04:55.452 --> 00:04:57.172
Sometimes it can kind of just jump

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:58.672
and then rip some skin off, but.

00:04:58.672 --> 00:04:59.572
I see.

00:04:59.572 --> 00:05:01.852
Of the potato or of my hand?

00:05:01.852 --> 00:05:02.752
Yes.

00:05:02.752 --> 00:05:05.892
Who'd have thought a potato has this much juice?

00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:08.452
Speaking of, now that we've worked out size,

00:05:08.452 --> 00:05:10.572
our next problem is that potatoes are,

00:05:11.592 --> 00:05:12.412
well,

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:13.252
food.

00:05:13.252 --> 00:05:15.732
You know, boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.012
However you skin them,

00:05:17.012 --> 00:05:19.612
they're not an ideal environment for a computer

00:05:19.612 --> 00:05:21.852
or any electronics for that matter.

00:05:21.852 --> 00:05:23.292
How are we looking horizontally?

00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:24.112
Uh.

00:05:25.232 --> 00:05:28.692
Pretty good.

00:05:28.692 --> 00:05:30.152
Good news.

00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:32.532
Reaching the IO is not gonna be an issue.

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:34.112
I'm up.

00:05:34.112 --> 00:05:36.592
Yeah, like the IO is going like right to the edge.

00:05:36.592 --> 00:05:38.172
Oh, wow.

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:40.032
We chose kind of the perfect potato.

00:05:40.032 --> 00:05:40.932
I couldn't help noticing then

00:05:40.932 --> 00:05:43.772
that I'm hollowing this out too much, maybe.

00:05:43.772 --> 00:05:45.652
Airflow, baby.

00:05:45.652 --> 00:05:46.492
Sure.

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:47.612
For a water-cooled system.

00:05:47.612 --> 00:05:48.832
Sure.

00:05:48.832 --> 00:05:50.452
Do we have a fan?

00:05:50.452 --> 00:05:51.572
Why would you need a fan?

00:05:51.572 --> 00:05:52.472
You're water cooling.

00:05:52.472 --> 00:05:54.512
I keep getting potato juice in my eye.

00:05:54.512 --> 00:05:55.952
It's good for the skin.

00:05:55.952 --> 00:05:57.972
Sure, but is it good for your eyes?

00:05:57.972 --> 00:05:59.072
There's an eye of the potato.

00:05:59.072 --> 00:06:00.212
It's the

00:06:00.257 --> 00:06:02.777
eye of the potato.

00:06:02.777 --> 00:06:04.397
The keen-eyed among you might have noticed

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:07.297
that we were just kinda willy-nilly

00:06:07.297 --> 00:06:09.117
putting this thing in here

00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:12.797
to mitigate some of the risk of the juice

00:06:12.797 --> 00:06:14.917
shorting out any of the components on our board.

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:19.517
We gave it a battering, like not this, like French fries,

00:06:19.517 --> 00:06:22.277
a battering of conformal coating to protect it

00:06:22.277 --> 00:06:23.957
from dangerous potato juices,

00:06:23.957 --> 00:06:26.768
all while being careful to leave access to any ports.

00:06:26.768 --> 00:06:30.048
Or any contact pins that we need for the system to function.

00:06:30.048 --> 00:06:33.148
Of course, that wasn't the original plan, was it?

00:06:34.256 --> 00:06:36.956
No, the original plan was to preserve

00:06:36.956 --> 00:06:38.656
the perfect potato before the shoot.

00:06:38.656 --> 00:06:41.596
I tried dehydrating, baking, freezing,

00:06:41.596 --> 00:06:45.076
a vacuum chamber, resin, a resin vacuum chamber,

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:46.376
but nothing really worked.

00:06:46.376 --> 00:06:48.256
No matter what I did, it would rot, collapse,

00:06:48.256 --> 00:06:50.336
or just look disgusting.

00:06:50.336 --> 00:06:51.296
I see that.

00:06:51.296 --> 00:06:53.416
So instead, we decided we're just gonna YOLO it,

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:55.796
do it all on set, for better or for worse.

00:06:55.796 --> 00:06:56.636
You're welcome?

00:06:56.636 --> 00:06:58.496
Yeah, I'd say that's for better.

00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:01.416
Is this even safe, let alone food safe?

00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:02.616
I wouldn't take a bite.

00:07:06.656 --> 00:07:09.576
Anywho, another part of the original plan

00:07:09.576 --> 00:07:12.176
was to transplant the entire cooling system

00:07:12.176 --> 00:07:14.336
from the Minisforum just to make our jobs

00:07:14.336 --> 00:07:18.056
a little bit easier, but that's dead too, huh?

00:07:18.056 --> 00:07:20.076
Yeah, it turns out problem number three,

00:07:20.076 --> 00:07:22.156
potatoes aren't very good for cooling.

00:07:22.156 --> 00:07:24.416
In fact, they're kind of good at insulating.

00:07:24.416 --> 00:07:26.496
So we had Justin, our resident mad scientist,

00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:29.536
fabricate this absolutely gorgeous water block.

00:07:29.536 --> 00:07:30.536
He did an amazing job.

00:07:30.536 --> 00:07:31.376
It looks so good.

00:07:31.376 --> 00:07:32.396
Even like the design on the top,

00:07:32.396 --> 00:07:33.876
I don't know if that was intentional,

00:07:33.876 --> 00:07:36.036
but it looks really good. It looks so cool.

00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:38.416
The cold plate is machined from billet copper,

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.876
and then the rest is resin 3D printed.

00:07:40.876 --> 00:07:41.568
Now,

00:07:41.568 --> 00:07:44.128
I'm told I'm not allowed to take it apart for you guys

00:07:44.128 --> 00:07:46.508
since the O-ring is kind of fragile,

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:48.888
but we've got a render and you guys can actually find

00:07:48.888 --> 00:07:50.488
the plans for this in the video description

00:07:50.488 --> 00:07:52.328
if you ever need to...

00:07:52.328 --> 00:07:53.848
This.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:54.688
For some reason.

00:07:56.028 --> 00:07:57.748
We ended up having to reinforce the seal

00:07:57.748 --> 00:07:59.388
with some CLA to prevent leakage,

00:07:59.388 --> 00:08:01.068
but the rest of the parts are recycled

00:08:01.068 --> 00:08:03.648
from our laptop water cooling adventure.

00:08:03.648 --> 00:08:04.888
Don't watch that video right now

00:08:04.888 --> 00:08:06.668
if you have a weak stomach though.

00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:08.988
Or if you want to witness history,

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:09.968
because if you want that,

00:08:09.968 --> 00:08:12.248
you're going to have to watch this video.

00:08:12.248 --> 00:08:14.208
Okay, moment of truth, the block's on.

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.788
It fits perfect.

00:08:19.788 --> 00:08:22.128
It actually does fit really, really well.

00:08:22.128 --> 00:08:24.528
All we've got to do is carve out some IO.

00:08:24.528 --> 00:08:26.068
You'll have to let us know in the comments.

00:08:26.068 --> 00:08:28.508
Is it game-tato or put game-o?

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.668
Now, David, question for you.

00:08:30.668 --> 00:08:32.928
Do we need to get at any of the other IO

00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:34.128
or is this side enough?

00:08:34.288 --> 00:08:35.488
That's all we need.

00:08:35.488 --> 00:08:37.208
We can power it through this dongle.

00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:38.588
We can do up to 90 Watts.

00:08:38.588 --> 00:08:39.428
Okay.

00:08:39.428 --> 00:08:40.268
Through this.

00:08:40.268 --> 00:08:41.088
Let's give it a shot.

00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:41.928
First boot.

00:08:41.928 --> 00:08:44.048
That's my computer.

00:08:44.048 --> 00:08:45.428
Hey, don't mock my computer.

00:08:45.428 --> 00:08:46.468
No, I love it.

00:08:46.468 --> 00:08:47.568
From my research,

00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:50.968
I don't think anyone has actually built a gaming potato.

00:08:50.968 --> 00:08:52.868
No, I didn't manage to find one either.

00:08:52.868 --> 00:08:53.868
So.

00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:55.108
World's first baby.

00:08:55.108 --> 00:08:56.688
Which is kind of shocking.

00:08:56.688 --> 00:08:58.256
With how many times it's been memed.

00:08:58.256 --> 00:09:00.056
Yeah, I was expecting to find like a hundred

00:09:00.056 --> 00:09:01.256
different YouTube videos about it.

00:09:01.256 --> 00:09:02.496
And then there's basically Homeless,

00:09:02.496 --> 00:09:05.256
who's gonna just do it way better than us.

00:09:05.256 --> 00:09:07.176
You can't do better than this.

00:09:07.176 --> 00:09:08.196
Don't challenge him.

00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:10.856
No, no, no, you can plug it right into the dongle.

00:09:10.856 --> 00:09:13.576
Or I can plug it right into the potato.

00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:15.736
I have proper peripherals,

00:09:15.736 --> 00:09:17.376
but for this part, we'll use these.

00:09:17.376 --> 00:09:19.156
Proper peripherals?

00:09:19.156 --> 00:09:20.636
Oh God.

00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:21.896
How do we power it on?

00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:22.736
I guess, is there just a switch?

00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:24.736
So there's a light, there is a power switch

00:09:24.736 --> 00:09:27.056
and there should be a light or there wasn't a case.

00:09:27.056 --> 00:09:28.236
Okay, there's a light.

00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:30.336
We know we don't have the water cooling hooked up yet,

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:33.896
but hopefully we can at least just get a post out of it.

00:09:33.896 --> 00:09:35.136
How long does this thing take to post?

00:09:35.136 --> 00:09:36.596
It doesn't take that long.

00:09:36.596 --> 00:09:37.836
You need to come on, turn up.

00:09:37.836 --> 00:09:38.676
Okay, it's off.

00:09:38.676 --> 00:09:39.496
That's good.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:40.336
Ooh, it's really hot, it's really hot.

00:09:40.336 --> 00:09:41.176
That's a good sign though, right?

00:09:41.176 --> 00:09:43.716
I mean, yeah, but also we didn't get an output.

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:45.276
Let's get the water cooling hooked up

00:09:45.276 --> 00:09:46.676
outside of the potato then.

00:09:46.676 --> 00:09:47.496
Yes.

00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:48.336
Real quick, real quick.

00:09:48.336 --> 00:09:50.336
We've gone with a dual 40 millimeter radiator,

00:09:50.336 --> 00:09:52.336
which for this kind of thermal load

00:09:52.336 --> 00:09:54.716
should be enough to run completely passively.

00:09:54.716 --> 00:09:56.996
And then this adorable little pump

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:58.236
from the water cooled laptop

00:09:58.236 --> 00:09:59.076
set up.

00:10:00.017 --> 00:10:01.397
There's water all over the board.

00:10:01.397 --> 00:10:02.297
What happened?

00:10:02.297 --> 00:10:03.137
It leaked.

00:10:03.137 --> 00:10:04.557
Fudge.

00:10:04.557 --> 00:10:05.397
Glass half full.

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:08.157
You guys get to see the inside of the block now.

00:10:08.157 --> 00:10:10.957
I mean, theoretically, this board's conformal coated, so.

00:10:10.957 --> 00:10:11.797
That's a good point.

00:10:11.797 --> 00:10:13.357
My bigger concern is just that we didn't get

00:10:13.357 --> 00:10:14.777
an HDMI output from this thing.

00:10:14.777 --> 00:10:15.617
That's fair.

00:10:15.617 --> 00:10:18.717
Our contact with the dye is actually not great.

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.397
It's probably fine.

00:10:20.397 --> 00:10:22.857
Just need to put some more thermal compound on here.

00:10:22.857 --> 00:10:25.337
Let's just test it without it being installed

00:10:25.337 --> 00:10:26.557
and see what happens.

00:10:29.104 --> 00:10:30.424
Oh my God.

00:10:30.424 --> 00:10:31.344
Did it work?

00:10:31.344 --> 00:10:34.284
Okay, that's a sensible picture.

00:10:34.284 --> 00:10:37.024
By the way, we're kind of bringing it back,

00:10:37.024 --> 00:10:41.124
but in a more everyday wearable form.

00:10:41.124 --> 00:10:43.724
Ah, coming soon to LTT store.

00:10:43.724 --> 00:10:45.424
I'm gonna find the leak.

00:10:45.424 --> 00:10:46.604
I'm gonna stamp it out.

00:10:47.764 --> 00:10:48.644
That's how you stop a leak.

00:10:48.644 --> 00:10:51.144
You just do, stop leaking.

00:10:52.064 --> 00:10:53.864
Oh, snap.

00:10:55.216 --> 00:10:56.496
Literal.

00:10:56.496 --> 00:10:57.976
Oh no.

00:10:57.976 --> 00:10:59.556
Yeah.

00:10:59.556 --> 00:11:02.136
How long does it take to resin print a new top?

00:11:02.136 --> 00:11:03.816
I guess we're about to find out.

00:11:04.816 --> 00:11:06.756
While we're waiting for our new block to print,

00:11:06.756 --> 00:11:09.656
let's talk about the advantages of resin printing.

00:11:09.656 --> 00:11:12.076
You can do more complex shapes with higher detail.

00:11:12.076 --> 00:11:15.676
It's low cost as well as much faster

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:17.236
than machining from acrylic.

00:11:17.236 --> 00:11:18.916
And it's just watertight,

00:11:18.916 --> 00:11:21.196
which is kind of important when we're making a water block.

00:11:21.196 --> 00:11:23.696
So it's a much better choice than FDM printing.

00:11:23.696 --> 00:11:25.116
This is gonna take about 40 minutes.

00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:26.136
It's pretty fast.

00:11:26.136 --> 00:11:26.976
Once we're through that,

00:11:26.976 --> 00:11:28.916
we're going to wash it and cure it.

00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:29.936
And we're gonna get back to it

00:11:29.936 --> 00:11:31.716
and hopefully finish this today.

00:11:31.716 --> 00:11:34.016
The downside to resin printing as we experienced,

00:11:34.016 --> 00:11:36.636
it can be brittle depending on the resin you use.

00:11:36.636 --> 00:11:38.556
We're now using tough resin,

00:11:38.556 --> 00:11:41.264
which should give us a little more Linus-

00:11:41.264 --> 00:11:47.584
proofness and the other big downside is just it's a mess and
there's fumes. It can be kind of annoying when you're done a print

00:11:47.584 --> 00:11:50.904
just dealing with the leftover resin getting it back and you know

00:11:52.784 --> 00:11:59.164
Watertight, could you 3d print some water cooling tubes? Are we
making a video on that right now?

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.830
The top is not the same as the previous one

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:09.670
that was printed.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.510
Oh, I see.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.630
It doesn't have the divider in the middle,

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.290
which quite honestly is not going to make a difference.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.130
Fantastic.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.210
And what could go wrong?

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.210
Y'all ready for this?

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.070
These holes are really small.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.830
Are you guys aware of that?

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:25.670
Yeah.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.270
It's, look, the blocks-

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.770
Well, that's why it cracked.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:29.728
Are you aware of that?

00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:30.848
I wasn't aware of that.

00:12:30.848 --> 00:12:32.008
Oh, here, look.

00:12:32.008 --> 00:12:33.928
Justin flew pretty close to the sun

00:12:33.928 --> 00:12:36.188
on the size of these holes,

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:38.308
and you can see that's actually

00:12:38.308 --> 00:12:39.808
probably what caused the cracking.

00:12:39.808 --> 00:12:41.388
We did a rush cure job,

00:12:41.388 --> 00:12:43.588
so the resin's still a little malleable.

00:12:43.588 --> 00:12:44.848
Oh, well, that's good.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:45.688
It's good.

00:12:45.688 --> 00:12:46.628
This is gonna go.

00:12:46.628 --> 00:12:48.068
It's gonna go, it's a goer.

00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:49.068
Not a shower.

00:12:49.068 --> 00:12:52.328
Without it being cracked, which is a plus,

00:12:52.328 --> 00:12:54.548
time to mount this bad boy.

00:12:54.548 --> 00:12:57.028
Now, just a gosh darn second here.

00:12:59.834 --> 00:13:02.594
It's not as thick as the old one

00:13:02.594 --> 00:13:04.294
and the screws are too tall.

00:13:04.294 --> 00:13:05.814
We can fix that.

00:13:05.814 --> 00:13:08.594
We will never be able to unscrew and re-screw them though.

00:13:09.454 --> 00:13:11.294
'Cause this will mangle the threads.

00:13:12.954 --> 00:13:13.794
Oh.

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.256
Hey, and we've got much better contact

00:13:16.256 --> 00:13:17.296
with the dye this time.

00:13:18.156 --> 00:13:19.476
I wonder if those previous screws

00:13:19.476 --> 00:13:20.876
were sticking through a little bit as well.

00:13:20.876 --> 00:13:22.416
Oh, maybe.

00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:24.636
There it is.

00:13:24.636 --> 00:13:26.536
That's what I'm talking about.

00:13:26.536 --> 00:13:27.656
Oh, it looks like cheese.

00:13:27.656 --> 00:13:28.496
I wanna eat it.

00:13:28.496 --> 00:13:31.056
It's an appropriate topping for a potato, certainly.

00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:32.556
Oh man, I wish I had the foresight.

00:13:32.556 --> 00:13:34.396
What, to make a block out of cheese?

00:13:36.136 --> 00:13:37.836
Is conformal coating cool or what?

00:13:37.836 --> 00:13:40.556
The fact that we just spilled water all over this board

00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:43.568
and here we are like half an hour later just using it.

00:13:43.568 --> 00:13:46.048
Why doesn't everything have conformal coating on it?

00:13:46.048 --> 00:13:50.208
Because it's expensive. It adds another step and it's more
difficult to repair after the fact.

00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:51.248
Oh, that makes sense.

00:13:51.248 --> 00:13:52.448
So there are reasons.

00:13:52.448 --> 00:13:54.768
I'm gonna just start covering everything I own in conformal
coating.

00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:56.048
Do you have like a spittle problem?

00:13:57.408 --> 00:13:58.288
Is there a reason?

00:13:58.288 --> 00:13:59.488
Really excited when I game.

00:13:59.488 --> 00:14:01.248
Is there a reason your electronics get wet?

00:14:05.488 --> 00:14:07.388
I think we're good.

00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:09.528
Tough resin, sure.

00:14:09.528 --> 00:14:11.328
Well, it's working.

00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:13.368
Oh, we need to make a little cutout for the tubes.

00:14:13.368 --> 00:14:15.448
Oh yeah, we need quite the cutout for the tubes.

00:14:15.448 --> 00:14:16.308
Oh, balls.

00:14:16.308 --> 00:14:18.488
So David, do you wanna eyeball this?

00:14:18.488 --> 00:14:19.328
Sure.

00:14:19.328 --> 00:14:20.888
So right about, yeah, sure.

00:14:20.888 --> 00:14:21.728
Okay.

00:14:24.408 --> 00:14:26.348
He looks like he's got braces.

00:14:26.348 --> 00:14:28.528
Who knew a potato case could be so modular?

00:14:28.528 --> 00:14:30.948
Man, I'm water cooling my pumpkin next Halloween.

00:14:30.948 --> 00:14:33.868
Did we have any thoughts for how to like seal up our case?

00:14:33.868 --> 00:14:34.808
Like what about hot glue?

00:14:34.808 --> 00:14:35.648
Would hot glue?

00:14:35.648 --> 00:14:36.468
Hot glue's worse.

00:14:36.468 --> 00:14:37.308
Hot glue's worse, all right.

00:14:37.308 --> 00:14:40.228
Oh, so you've actually put measurable R and D into this.

00:14:40.228 --> 00:14:43.728
I've tried everything to try and make potatoes happen.

00:14:43.728 --> 00:14:46.088
If you can pull on the tubes a little bit,

00:14:46.088 --> 00:14:47.128
just to, yep.

00:14:47.128 --> 00:14:47.968
Oh boy.

00:14:47.968 --> 00:14:48.808
Oh yeah, there we go.

00:14:48.808 --> 00:14:50.248
Oh yeah, oh, there we go.

00:14:50.248 --> 00:14:51.368
Okay, a little more.

00:14:52.592 --> 00:14:55.776
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:14:55.776 --> 00:14:59.536
Oh buddy, I mean, oh spuddy.

00:14:59.536 --> 00:15:04.076
Oh spuddy, that's a filthy joke.

00:15:04.076 --> 00:15:04.916
What do you expect?

00:15:04.916 --> 00:15:06.536
It came out of the ground.

00:15:06.536 --> 00:15:08.196
Oh, we need power button.

00:15:08.196 --> 00:15:09.556
Oh right, no, no, that's okay.

00:15:09.556 --> 00:15:11.456
I got a solution for that.

00:15:11.456 --> 00:15:12.656
Okay.

00:15:12.656 --> 00:15:15.336
Now you're speaking my language, my power button.

00:15:15.336 --> 00:15:16.636
Okay. My jankwich.

00:15:16.636 --> 00:15:19.416
So this, maybe I could cut a little spot for it.

00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:21.476
After, after, first let's make sure this thing works.

00:15:21.476 --> 00:15:23.776
Oh, a pump.

00:15:23.776 --> 00:15:27.770
Whoa.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.430
All that's left then is to seal up our potato.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.270
Oh, uh-oh.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.170
Probably fine. Oh, 'cause we just, yeah.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.270
Yeah, yeah, hold on, hold on.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.710
See advanced repair.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.110
No, we got to Windows before.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.070
I bet this just boots.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.310
This probably just boots.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.950
Time to seal the deal.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.930
The only thing we're missing is some peripherals.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:45.810
Oh, wow.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:46.650
That worked really well.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.070
That immediately was like,

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.810
"Yo, you're not taking this apart anymore."

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:50.770
Okay.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:51.610
Potato PC.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.450
Okay.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.290
Okay, does it need,

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.290
I think we need a little stand so it doesn't roll around.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.310
What's it, potato wedges?

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.290
Potato wedges, I get it.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.017
What about?

00:16:00.017 --> 00:16:00.857
Okay.

00:16:00.857 --> 00:16:03.377
Our potato fry monitor bezel.

00:16:03.377 --> 00:16:04.517
Oh my goodness.

00:16:04.517 --> 00:16:07.717
Wow, David, you made that.

00:16:08.737 --> 00:16:11.777
Hash brown desk mat, baby.

00:16:11.777 --> 00:16:12.977
Oh, what?

00:16:12.977 --> 00:16:14.337
Oh, what, why?

00:16:14.337 --> 00:16:15.177
Oh.

00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:26.678
And what better mouse to use than a potato mouse?

00:16:26.678 --> 00:16:28.738
Did you guys get a Makey Makey or something?

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.858
No, it's just a mouse.

00:16:30.858 --> 00:16:31.918
They took the insides out.

00:16:31.918 --> 00:16:34.558
I conformal coated it and it works.

00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.718
I think I can even hear the clicks.

00:16:37.718 --> 00:16:38.558
Yep.

00:16:39.578 --> 00:16:40.418
Yeah, there it is.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.780
Surprisingly, this does appear to be tracking serviceably.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.620
Hold on, I'm gonna launch a game.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.800
Let's play some, hold on,

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.900
the click is a little bit of a challenge.

00:16:54.192 --> 00:16:55.732
I'm launching Halo Infinite.

00:16:55.732 --> 00:16:56.912
Okay, here we go.

00:16:56.912 --> 00:16:57.812
This works.

00:16:57.812 --> 00:16:59.972
Oh my God, it actually kind of works.

00:17:02.052 --> 00:17:04.212
Ah, ah.

00:17:04.212 --> 00:17:05.872
And no self-respecting gamer

00:17:05.872 --> 00:17:09.772
can possibly complete their setup without RGB.

00:17:09.772 --> 00:17:10.772
Potato powered RGB.

00:17:12.112 --> 00:17:13.992
You've got one LED lit.

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:15.132
Yeah.

00:17:15.132 --> 00:17:15.972
R, G, B.

00:17:19.092 --> 00:17:22.252
Was there not enough current to light more than one LED?

00:17:22.252 --> 00:17:24.312
So I actually have a battery powering it currently.

00:17:24.312 --> 00:17:25.152
Oh.

00:17:25.152 --> 00:17:26.512
It's cheating.

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:28.932
It was really cool when it first was put together.

00:17:28.932 --> 00:17:31.232
You're lucky I didn't have time to make the potato keyboard.

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:36.792
The mouse is surprisingly somewhat usable.

00:17:36.792 --> 00:17:38.612
What do you think of the hash brown desk pad?

00:17:38.612 --> 00:17:41.372
It's really, it's kind of unpleasant and greasy, but.

00:17:41.372 --> 00:17:42.752
LTT store when?

00:17:42.752 --> 00:17:44.952
Okay, well, how's our CPU doing?

00:17:44.952 --> 00:17:47.372
We're at 50 degrees right now.

00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:48.772
That's definitely warmer than we got

00:17:48.772 --> 00:17:50.672
when we first tested the system.

00:17:50.672 --> 00:17:51.512
Okay.

00:17:51.512 --> 00:17:53.612
But it wasn't in a potato, so.

00:17:53.612 --> 00:17:54.652
Change of plans.

00:17:54.652 --> 00:17:56.152
We're going with Doom Eternal.

00:17:56.152 --> 00:17:58.532
The goal, one kill.

00:17:58.532 --> 00:18:00.017
I was pretty impressed with the performance.

00:18:00.017 --> 00:18:01.397
I was getting out of this thing.

00:18:01.397 --> 00:18:02.617
I was a little bit weird and doomed

00:18:02.617 --> 00:18:04.017
'cause I was only getting 25 frames

00:18:04.017 --> 00:18:05.517
and I realized ray tracing was on.

00:18:05.517 --> 00:18:07.037
Oh.

00:18:07.037 --> 00:18:09.777
You know what, 25 frames with ray tracing, pretty good.

00:18:09.777 --> 00:18:11.717
Oh man, my arm muscles

00:18:11.717 --> 00:18:14.117
from how hard it is to push on the click.

00:18:14.117 --> 00:18:19.117
I am getting 45, 55 frames per second.

00:18:20.417 --> 00:18:21.257
Right click.

00:18:22.177 --> 00:18:23.017
Get up! Come on!

00:18:23.017 --> 00:18:23.917
Oh, did I get him?

00:18:23.917 --> 00:18:24.817
I think you did.

00:18:24.817 --> 00:18:25.657
Oh no, you didn't.

00:18:25.657 --> 00:18:26.497
No, I didn't.

00:18:26.497 --> 00:18:27.104
Hold on, right click.

00:18:27.104 --> 00:18:29.724
Am I, oh, I'm not, am I not on the right?

00:18:29.724 --> 00:18:31.364
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:18:31.364 --> 00:18:32.404
Glory kill, glory kill!

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:33.864
Here we go, here we go!

00:18:33.864 --> 00:18:34.704
Yes!

00:18:34.912 --> 00:18:37.312
Potato gaming boys!

00:18:37.312 --> 00:18:39.052
Med pack, med pack!

00:18:39.052 --> 00:18:39.892
Oh, my mouse-

00:18:39.892 --> 00:18:42.032
No, it's coming apart! My mouse fell apart!

00:18:42.032 --> 00:18:43.552
Hold on, I got this!

00:18:43.552 --> 00:18:45.352
I can't click.

00:18:45.352 --> 00:18:47.192
It's coming apart, no!

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.152
I can't click.

00:18:48.152 --> 00:18:50.372
This has got to be top 10 stupidest things

00:18:50.372 --> 00:18:51.272
we've ever done.

00:18:51.272 --> 00:18:52.532
No. No?

00:18:52.532 --> 00:18:53.532
Top three.

00:18:55.912 --> 00:18:57.692
I'm so happy I got to be here for this.

00:18:57.692 --> 00:18:58.912
The desk mat's coming apart.

00:18:58.912 --> 00:18:59.752
Oh, no!

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:03.152
Oh, wow, the everything.

00:19:04.656 --> 00:19:08.976
Okay, but like, can we appreciate for a moment

00:19:08.976 --> 00:19:11.276
how amazing this is?

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:13.676
With root access,

00:19:13.676 --> 00:19:18.076
we're managing some seriously impressive hash power.

00:19:18.076 --> 00:19:19.716
Which of us is responsible for that line?

00:19:19.716 --> 00:19:21.996
I think it was a team thing.

00:19:21.996 --> 00:19:23.556
Sorry, it was Big Potato

00:19:23.556 --> 00:19:25.156
that forced us to put that in there.

00:19:25.156 --> 00:19:27.516
As much of a meme as this project was,

00:19:27.516 --> 00:19:29.536
it is amazing, guys,

00:19:29.536 --> 00:19:33.756
what you can do with a tiny APU-powered PC these days.

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:37.376
And I really hope that even if this

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:40.196
wasn't the most practical application of this,

00:19:40.196 --> 00:19:41.656
this gets your tractor rolling,

00:19:41.656 --> 00:19:44.556
coming up with cool ideas for fitting powerful computers

00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:48.556
in places that they have no right to be,

00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:52.356
like in this, the world's first peelable case.

00:19:52.356 --> 00:19:54.996
And in this segue to our sponsor.

00:19:54.996 --> 00:19:56.196
If you guys enjoyed this,

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:58.756
if you like janky, dumb, but spectacular builds,

00:19:58.756 --> 00:20:00.016
you might like our video where we built

00:20:00.017 --> 00:20:04.857
Compensator 4 with the most expensive consumer parts we could get
our hands on.
