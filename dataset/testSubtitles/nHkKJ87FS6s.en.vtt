♪ Ooh ♪

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.170
- All right, welcome to

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.830
the definitive iPhone
versus Android video.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.420
It's the impossible debate, right?

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.220
In a lot of ways, people just get

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.750
so entrenched on one side

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.760
that they never wanna
flip to the other side.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.630
To each their own.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.258
You hear that all the time,
but I have a solution.

00:00:19.258 --> 00:00:20.460
So here's how we're gonna do this.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.720
So I'm gonna break this down into

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.210
seven actually meaningful categories,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.520
so it's an odd number, so there
has to be a winner, no tie,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.320
but since we're not
psychos and we know that

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.210
one winner doesn't automatically apply

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.620
to every human on earth,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.210
I'm actually gonna give you a system,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.577
a rubric to help figure out
the real winner for yourself.

00:00:36.577 --> 00:00:39.300
You'll see what I mean. Let's get into it.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.133
So, all right.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.038
Category number one. Customization.

00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:46.110
Basically, if you see this
icon and you get excited,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.090
then you probably love customization too.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.470
So, digging into the settings

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.900
and messing around with the
home screen and the lock screen

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.120
and tweaking things and behaviors

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.360
to make the device
absolutely perfect for you,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.490
I mean, it's a hobby all on its own.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.300
Now, at first in 2023, it
might actually seem like

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.005
iOS 17 and Android 14
are pretty close, right?

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:09.150
I mean, let's be real.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.610
iOS just added a bunch
of really good features

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.660
that are very well done.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.670
The new lock screen update
gives you the ability

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.580
to change all these clock fonts and colors

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.490
and put various super useful
widgets on your lock screen

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.220
and then save a bunch of
different lock screen setups

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.070
for different situations
and different focus modes,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.470
and then widgets were also
added to the home screen

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.700
less than two years ago as well,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.830
so that unlocked a ton of customization

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.800
of home screen setups displaying
glanceable information,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.300
but the more you look into it,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.390
the more you realize it's
not actually that close,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.860
and a lot of this really just
comes down to the fact that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.170
Apple, they do keep adding
all these abilities,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.730
but you're always restricted to

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.937
doing it the Apple way, the correct way,

00:01:47.937 --> 00:01:50.413
and so that's why a lot of iPhone setups

00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:52.350
still just kind of look the same.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.780
Like, even if you just
take stock Android 14

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.860
from the Google Pixel,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.451
which isn't even the most
customizable version of Android,

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:01.453
there's still way more
that you can change,

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:04.320
from the colors of the theme of the OS

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.230
matching the color of your
wallpaper thanks to Material You

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.426
to icon packs, custom widget sizes.

00:02:10.426 --> 00:02:11.820
I mean, Android will just kind of

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.010
let you do whatever you want.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.843
On the iPhone,

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.460
you can't expand a widget
to any size you want.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.660
You can't put an app

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.390
just on the right side of your
home screen for reachability.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.010
You literally can't even place an app

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.480
wherever you want on the home screen.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.960
It must be the next up in
the grid of Apple's choosing.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.670
You can't change the grid's size.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.571
You can't change the icon sizes.

00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:33.750
I mean, it just takes a
whole bunch of extra work

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.450
and a Siri Shortcuts hack
just to use a custom icon.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.470
Just basic stuff.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.760
Now, I think the other
side of that coin is

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.230
you can make a truly ugly,
horrible Android setup,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.600
where you can't really mess up

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.280
an iPhone home screen that much.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.540
So, while you can definitely argue that

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.340
iOS does it prettier,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.630
the winner for most customization,
that would be Android.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.630
So, then category number
two, features, all right?

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.960
Just straight up which
one can do more stuff.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.160
This has been one of the hottest debates

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.487
at the forefront of iOS versus Android

00:03:04.487 --> 00:03:06.360
conversations you always hear,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.510
mostly because both
platforms, at some level,

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.780
launched missing features,
but especially the iPhone.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.613
Like, you'd always hear,

00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:17.160
"Wow, can you believe the iPhone
can't even set wallpapers?"

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.020
And then it was, "Can
you believe the iPhone

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.840
is just now getting copy
and paste, seriously?"

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.862
And then it's, "Wow, it's crazy that iOS

00:03:23.862 --> 00:03:26.190
is just getting widgets
now a decade later."

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.220
But, hey, now, it's 2023 and
they're both very complete,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.510
and even in the ways that they're not,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.460
they're copying each other all the time.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.950
You always see a new keynote
with new stuff on Android,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.360
and you're like, that came from iOS,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.160
and then you'll see stuff
from the iPhone keynote

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.930
and be like, that came from Android,

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.100
but there's even some new stuff now

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.440
that the iPhone has that Android doesn't.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.600
A pretty good one recently is focus modes,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.390
which gives you super high
control over notifications

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.070
in various different situations

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.810
with your apps and your contacts.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.270
There are also a lot of privacy features,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.910
things like Hide My Email with iCloud Plus

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.453
and iCloud Private Relay.

00:03:58.453 --> 00:04:02.190
You could even argue that
Dynamic Island on the Pro iPhone

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.870
is a feature if you want to,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.190
but, I mean, I just couldn't

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.380
because only a small
handful of apps support it,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.910
but it's something pretty cool and unique,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.950
which is more and more rare than ever

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.970
in the smartphone world.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.080
At this point, though,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.793
neither OS is really missing
any gigantic features anymore.

00:04:16.793 --> 00:04:19.200
They've both matured up to this level

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.430
where they're their own character.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.694
They both do a lot of stuff,

00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:26.430
but I still am gonna have to give the edge

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.089
to Android in this one

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:30.180
just because there are
so many little, like,

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.490
tweaky, like little OS-level features,

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.460
just little things that you
can tweak and change on Android

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.500
that still just are not on the iPhone.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.020
So I'm talking like
battery management features

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.790
to customized charging speeds

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.300
or set manual charge limits
to preserve battery life.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.970
There's also an actual
file management system

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.440
so you can drag and drop things

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.140
onto your phone into certain
folders if you want to.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.139
There's gaming-specific
features like game modes,

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.180
the ability to dial up and down

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.880
your screen's refresh
rate whenever you want to.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.410
Independent volume controls

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.870
for phone calls and ringtones and alarms.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.910
Also, reverse wireless
charging comes up a lot

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.380
for charging wireless earbuds

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.030
without breaking out a separate cable.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.030
Really, just, it comes down
to the benefit of Android

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.371
is having so much feature choice.

00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:15.990
That's kind of the point,

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.940
and this also bleeds into hardware too.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.470
So, even if the feature you want

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.524
is a huge camera with no notch,

00:05:22.524 --> 00:05:25.350
then you have to get an
Android phone, right?

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.350
So, if the feature is a super
fast charging or a 10x camera

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.999
or USB Type-C,

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.910
as of right now, it's
gotta be an Android phone.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.580
So, even though they both
offer all of the basic features

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.920
and they appear to copy
each other all the time

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.180
on little added stuff,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.630
the winner here, again,
is definitely Android.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.136
Now, number three is ease of use.

00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:52.110
Now, ease of use is very
valuable to a lot of people,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.386
like a lot of people, and the
thing about ease of use is

00:05:55.386 --> 00:05:58.710
it often basically has
an inverse relationship

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.920
with customization and a ton of features,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.540
'cause there's this delicate balancing act

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.450
you have to do of having flexibility,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.490
giving flexibility to the user,

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.660
but not overwhelming them

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.280
with a ton of buttons and settings,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.260
and this is really where the iPhone excels

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.220
and has excelled for years
as a high priority for sure,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.140
even in the most fundamental ways.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.610
The home screen on the iPhone

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.980
has had up to four icons in the dock

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.469
on every iPhone since the beginning,

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:27.630
and the phone icon has always been green

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.650
and always been on the left
every single time for 17 years.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.940
The iPhone's camera app,

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.610
we've all seen that stay
fundamentally the same

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.830
with the viewfinder and the sliding modes.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.210
It's been like that for years,

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.890
and that kind of tucks
away a lot of the settings

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.360
into a separate settings app

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.890
and it can feel like
it's missing features,

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.960
but, honestly, it's still the easiest

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.840
and most straightforward
for most people to use.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.450
It's like they hate changing
things for no good reason.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.420
The calculator has basically
been unchanged for years.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.650
Now, there's also downsides to that,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.570
like Siri has basically been ignored

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.270
since it was introduced, but, still, like,

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.510
Apple moves the call end
button by like 200 pixels

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.090
to the middle of the screen
and people freak out about it.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.923
Sometimes, it feels like

00:07:06.923 --> 00:07:09.240
Android versions will
just move stuff around

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.540
just kind of to try it and for
the sake of changing things,

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.920
and sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn't.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.753
They'll move it back,

00:07:14.753 --> 00:07:17.850
and that's interesting
and exciting sometimes,

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.050
but that does hurt just user
continuity and ease of use.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.420
Maybe not for you watching this video,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.890
but just think for the average person,

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.540
like for your five closest friends.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.270
Think about how they use their phone.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.470
Yeah, then throw on top of that,

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.780
there's basically never any bloatware

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.860
loaded onto the iPhone ever,
and then customer service is

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.020
basically always better for an iPhone

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.520
because Apple stores are everywhere

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.010
and Apple controls that entire experience,

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.000
for better or for worse,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.830
so they get to do great
work with customers.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.500
So it's just for people
who are not enthusiasts

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.806
who just wanna get the thing
and not think about it anymore,

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:55.350
they pretty much always
go with the iPhone.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.140
So ease of use is a
checkbox for the iPhone.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.390
By the way, if you're enjoying
this video, get subscribed.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.680
Why not? It's free.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.750
All right, so we gotta talk about updates.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.450
So number four is support.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.490
So this is something that I would classify

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.570
as kind of underrated,

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.880
just because I don't think enough people

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.460
buy their new phone that
they plan on having for years

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.390
with this in mind.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.370
I think having the latest
and greatest updates,

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.374
software, and security
patches as quick as possible

00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:23.850
and as long as possible
should be a priority,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.800
but it usually isn't for people.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.740
Either way, it's kind of a
mixed bag across the board.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.096
In Android world, some
companies make no promises

00:08:31.096 --> 00:08:33.270
or they kind of break their promises.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.290
Some have short promises and
some will actually extend out

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.710
to promising three to four
years of software updates.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.030
Weirdly, Samsung right now

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.670
is the undisputed king of
Android software updates,

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.400
with some rumors of maybe
Google catching back up,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.320
but Samsung announced in 2019

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.170
that all devices in 2019 or later

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.510
will get four years of security updates

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.850
and some flagships will even get five,

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.690
but none of them really
come close to the iPhone.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.880
When iOS 17 comes out this fall,

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.230
every iPhone back to
the iPhone 10R from 2018

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.110
is officially supported and
gonna get the latest version.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.205
That's five major
software version updates.

00:09:13.205 --> 00:09:17.520
I don't think there are any
Android phones from 2018

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.800
that are gonna get the
latest version of Android 14

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.633
when it comes out.

00:09:20.633 --> 00:09:22.530
So this one easily goes

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.600
to the vertically-integrated Apple phone

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.610
with the Apple software all day.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.305
So, now, my number five category is apps.

00:09:30.305 --> 00:09:32.670
This one is actually kind of fascinating.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.830
So, obviously, we have our standard,

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.650
like our apps that we
all use every single day

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.120
on our phones that we're used to,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.260
but then sometimes it's fun

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.772
just sort of popping around
in the respective app stores,

00:09:42.772 --> 00:09:46.230
discovering new things, finding fun apps,

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.050
and, at this point, they
are both flourishing.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.280
There's millions of apps now.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.560
There's over three and a half million apps

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.060
in the Google Play Store,

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.240
and over a million and a
half in Apple's App Store,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.630
which if you just stop there,
looks like a win for Android,

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.350
but quality over quantity, my friends.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.460
Quality over quantity.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.180
Basically, every major app is
available for both platforms,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.013
which means there are many
more, you know, niche apps

00:10:10.013 --> 00:10:14.253
or relatively unknown
possible diamonds in the rough

00:10:14.253 --> 00:10:17.430
on the Google Play Store,
sure, but the difference is

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.920
when you actually talk to these developers

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.390
and observe the cycle of, like,

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.180
how they get made and how
these apps get updated,

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.200
the truth is so many of
them are prioritizing iOS,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.180
and, really, it's purely for efficiency.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.013
Think about it.

00:10:31.013 --> 00:10:33.767
If you just have to update
one version of your app

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:36.420
and it works with all the
newest iPhones instantly

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.370
and works perfectly for millions of people

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.240
who all have basically
the same aspect ratio,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.420
of course you'd do it, flip that switch,

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.290
but, with Android,

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.600
there are naturally
many more complexities.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.190
There are a bunch of different devices

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.810
that all have different aspect ratios

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.070
and different pixel densities

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.740
and different feature
support and even foldables,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.780
and it's like it's a lot more work

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.150
to get all of those users up to date

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.980
with the same level of optimization.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.900
It's a lot of different switches to flip,

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.970
so a lot of 'em just don't
go through all of that

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.320
or they take way longer to.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.570
So the number of titles is one thing,

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:11.330
but is it the same Instagram
app on both iPhone and Android?

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.811
Is it the same Threads app on each one?

00:11:13.811 --> 00:11:16.440
As someone who's been
carrying and using both phones

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.420
and often using the
same app on both phones,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.280
I have a firsthand experience
of knowing that, often,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.080
even with some of Google's own apps,

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.540
the updates are prioritized on the iPhone.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.143
They come first to the iPhone
before they come to Android.

00:11:30.143 --> 00:11:31.590
I wish that wasn't true.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.170
I wish they were just as
easy to do one or the other,

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.730
but that's just the truth of it.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.520
So the slight app advantage is
gonna go to the iPhone here,

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.540
and interestingly enough,

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.290
this also applies
generally to accessories.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.735
Again, same reason, same efficiency,

00:11:45.735 --> 00:11:47.250
but that's a win for the iPhone.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.140
So then, category number six,

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.720
I'm gonna go a little more
subjective with this one,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.840
but I still think it
matters, which is excitement.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.065
Which one is more interesting or exciting

00:11:58.065 --> 00:11:59.730
in the moment to you?

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.260
Now, honestly, I get pretty excited

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.810
for a lot of different
new tech these days,

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.160
and, actually, because there's only

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.260
like one or two new
iPhone drops every year,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.460
it's actually very easy

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.800
to get hype built up for the new iPhone,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.470
but it's definitely a
different type of excitement

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.470
with the massive variety of
new innovations and things

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.600
that come to Android phones all the time.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.720
Like, if you just are
interested in folding phones,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.240
well, there's more Android
releases than ever for that.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.970
Want a gaming phone? There's
gonna be an Android for that.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.640
Do you want a headphone jack?
Do you want a compact phone?

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.220
Do you want the world's fastest charging?

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.470
Do you want some interesting
new unique designs

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.020
or materials or textures
or experimental features?

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.820
Like, that is the world of Android,

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.340
and if you think about it,
seriously think about this,

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.770
most of the interesting excitement

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.250
around every new iPhone
launch, the question really is,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.520
is this new iPhone going
to get a new feature

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.460
that's been in Android phones for years?

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.686
Like, are we finally gonna
get USB-C on an iPhone?

00:12:56.686 --> 00:12:59.875
Are we finally gonna get
fast charging on an iPhone?

00:12:59.875 --> 00:13:02.753
Are we finally gonna get a 5x camera?

00:13:02.753 --> 00:13:06.013
And so just for that novelty reason alone,

00:13:06.013 --> 00:13:08.040
the excitement category,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.450
that's definitely gotta go to Android.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.670
So that brings us to my last category,

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.760
number seven, ecosystem.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.890
We've heard this word before, ecosystem.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.140
So, okay, say what you want,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.780
but there are a lot of people
who will not buy a phone

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.210
if it doesn't have iMessage
or FaceTime, whatever it is,

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.750
and Apple has weaponized this
and built walls around this

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.730
and closed it off as much as possible.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.160
Technically, you can join a
FaceTime from an Android phone,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.570
but you can't start one.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.540
So I made an entire video
just about Apple's ecosystem.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.240
Hate it or love it, it is
important to some people.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.590
Now, the thing is

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.560
Apple is not the only
one with an ecosystem.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.510
Like, look at Samsung for example.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.910
Apple happens to build bigger walls

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.580
around keeping people
into their ecosystem,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.270
but Samsung has a lot of
equivalents to all the same pieces.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.000
Like, you could get a
Samsung Galaxy S flagship

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.080
and you could quickly and easily

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.510
connect your Galaxy
Buds just like AirPods.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.340
You put on your Galaxy watch

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.590
with a lot of the same
features as the Apple watch.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.620
You tether to a Samsung Tab
just for entertainment purposes,

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.010
like an iPad, but then
you get a Galaxy Book Pro

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.890
with cellular internet sharing
and wireless Quick Share,

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.480
just like a MacBook Pro with AirDrop.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.610
You see where I'm going? It
just keeps going and going.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.680
I'm sure Samsung is
eventually gonna come out

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.870
with their smart speaker
to match the home pod.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.720
It's totally, totally
coming, but on paper,

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.540
the idea is they are
surprisingly congruent.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.670
So, the way I see it, at
the time of this recording,

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.860
'cause this could change very
soon in the next couple weeks,

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.070
but the main advantages
of Samsung's ecosystem

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:42.180
would be things like one USB-C
across literally everything,

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.390
so you can use one charging
cable for all of your stuff.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.072
Two, they make more
different versions of devices

00:14:48.072 --> 00:14:49.800
that fit into the ecosystem.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.260
Like, there are a ton of different phones

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.820
and a bunch of different watches

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.100
and different headphones
and laptops, et cetera,

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.590
so there's more flexibility
and hardware choice.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.810
Classic Android, plus Samsung
also makes other stuff

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.810
that connects, like
dishwashers and refrigerators,

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.273
but then the advantages
of Apple's ecosystem,

00:15:06.273 --> 00:15:09.150
not just in the US, but especially here,

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.060
are, first of all, ease
of use and seamlessness.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.490
Like, it is genuinely crazy how good

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.980
some of the continuity stuff
is in Apple's ecosystem.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.050
Like, something like Continuity Camera

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.030
is so sick every time.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.080
You just push one button

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.500
to use a super high quality
iPhone camera as your webcam.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.270
It works very, very well,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.260
but then the popularity
factor, especially in the US,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.995
makes things like FaceTime and iMessage

00:15:33.995 --> 00:15:37.110
and the Find My Network super strong.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.280
So I can make a whole video on this.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.110
I could put up the
strengths and weaknesses

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.430
and put up just these two
ecosystems up against each other,

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.392
but, as of right now,
they're both very strong,

00:15:47.392 --> 00:15:50.730
and I'm gonna give the
slight edge to Apple's,

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.650
just because, one, I'm in the US

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.090
and that advantage is strong,

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.740
but, two, just because of the seamlessness

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.030
and how well things are integrated

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.340
and the continuity features are unreal.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.960
So, if we tally these all up here,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.540
you can see that the objective winner,

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.510
in four out of the seven
categories that I made up,

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:10.140
is the iPhone, but put
your pitchforks down.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:10.973
Guess what?

00:16:11.969 --> 00:16:13.260
As you've probably picked up

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.093
from the beginning of this video,

00:16:14.093 --> 00:16:15.930
there is no objective winner

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.060
to a decision as personal as this one

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.890
and when the options are this close.

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:20.723
You probably already know,

00:16:20.723 --> 00:16:21.720
if you've been watching my videos,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.980
you know I main an Android phone

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.057
most of the time alongside an iPhone,

00:16:26.057 --> 00:16:29.156
but my main phone and my
main customized setups

00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:31.440
are on the Android phone, so what gives?

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.980
Like, picking one de facto
winner kind of suggests that

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.329
the one winner is best for everyone,

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:41.670
but we already know that there's
some people who literally

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.920
don't care about some features

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.500
that some others would say
they can't live without.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.690
So I've devised a very basic system

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.757
to help you pick your winner for yourself,

00:16:51.757 --> 00:16:53.520
and it's really quite simple.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.780
All you have to do

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:59.780
is put these seven categories
in order of importance to you

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.560
and then rate each one of them

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.030
let's say on a scale from one to five.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.670
So give them a one to five point rating

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.890
based on how much you care about it.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.590
So, here, for me, I care the most about

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:13.020
customization and features.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.430
Then I care a lot about apps,

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.980
and excitement and updates
are decently important,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.480
but then in my daily driver,

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.970
ease of use and ecosystem
aren't that big of a deal.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.470
I've got a mixed bag.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.140
So then I just give the
amount of points earned

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.850
to each winner of that category.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:30.009
So the winner for me is clearly Android,

00:17:30.009 --> 00:17:31.449
but, hey, for you,

00:17:31.449 --> 00:17:34.980
maybe you care a lot about
ecosystem and maybe nothing else.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.050
I'm sure you know someone like this.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.545
Then the iPhone will clearly
be calling your name,

00:17:39.545 --> 00:17:41.580
or if you're the type who wants

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.190
all the features and
excitement in the world,

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.590
well, then Android probably
is what's in your pocket.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.630
You might even have your own
category you could add in

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.010
that's heavily weighted.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.570
I kind of see it like buying a car.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.030
Like maybe Cool Factor
is in there. Have at it.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.230
It turns out buying a phone

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.650
is one of the most personal
decisions you make.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.610
I've said this before, but, like,

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.470
it's the thing you spent your money on

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.240
and you carry everywhere you go,

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.220
and so that's why people
get so worked up about

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.840
this side versus that side,

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.460
but, at the end of the day,

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.403
the winner, not to be cheesy, is us,

00:18:11.403 --> 00:18:14.640
because they're competing
against each other to get better

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.763
to hopefully win you over, and
that's the way it should be.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.023
Thanks for watching.

00:18:20.023 --> 00:18:21.741
Catch you in the next one.

00:18:21.741 --> 00:18:22.574
Peace.

00:18:22.574 --> 00:18:26.648
