And for our first challenge,
we have an Olympic sprinter.

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:22.255
Whichever one of you touches
him first moves on.

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.256
Go for it.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.824
[woman] Oh, no!

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.459

Oh, my God, look at that.

[Logan] I'm gonna get you.

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.504
[MrBeast] Oh, oh!

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.139
[Logan] [indistinct]

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:41.307
Wow, that was quick.

-[man] Dang!
-[man] Oh.

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:47.280
We're banging these out.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.082
[man] Wow.

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.220
[MrBeast] Oh, wow,
that was awesome.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:58.124 line:0%

<i> For the third challenge,</i>

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:02.595

 everybody and we hid the money</i>

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.135 line:0%
in the middle
of the field confused.

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:10.870
You can all remove
your blindfold.

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:13.506

-Go--
-Go! Go!

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.480
[ZHC] I don't see it
anywhere here.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.714
Let's go to level four.

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:22.882
I wanna say six
because it has a star

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:24.217
next to it.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.119
[Lexi] I'm on the third level.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:27.553
Hello, million dollars?

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:28.754
[Quackity] It's got
to be on the main floor.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:30.356
I don't think it went higher.

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.125
[Ryan] I just did a full circle
on the top floor.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:33.326
Didn't find anything.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.194
Look at all this.
So much to explore.

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:36.629
I'm going up. Let's go up.

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.531
[Ryan] We're six.

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:41.200
[Mark] Ah, the cameras are here.
That's got to mean something.

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:42.502
[Quackity]
There's a camera over here.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.372
-Ah, so much running.
-[Quackity] Yeah.

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:48.341
-Yeah, there it is, yeah!
-[Mark] We found it.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.343
[Quackity] Yeah!
I found the million dollars.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.411 line:0%
[woman]<i> The money

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:54.413 line:0%

I'm glad I woke up for this.

[MrBeast]<i> Next I brought
 our remaining contestants</i>

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.452
<i> and our three winners
 to the YouTube Theater,</i>

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:00.786 line:0%
<i> which is right beside
 the stadium.</i>

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.488 line:0%
This next challenge is trivia

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:03.890 line:0%
and it's pretty simple.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:06.292 line:0%
I have one question,
what is the total subscriber

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:09.362 line:0%
count of all 15 people
invited plus me?

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.231
I'm starting a 60-second timer.
Good luck.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:13.633
I have seen everybody's channels

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.568
but I actually don't know
how many subscribers

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.336 line:0%
-everybody has.
-I'm gonna take a wild guess

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.405 line:0%
because I don't have
60 seconds to do this math.

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:20.873
It's called simple arithmetic.

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:22.608
Preston, what are you on?
Aren't you only 20?

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:23.876 line:0%
-Close.
-Hey, Logan,

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.678
-how many do you have?
-Twenty-three.

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.580
-[MrBeast] Twenty-three.
-Stop asking.

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:28.848
I think he just hit 20, so.

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.616
I'm not telling anyone.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:31.617 line:0%
How many subs do you guys have?

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.320 line:0%
-I have 8.2.
-I have 5.8.

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:36.422
Bella, what do you think
the number is?

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:38.958
I wouldn't know either.
I see Zach doing a lot of recon.

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.893
Zach's asking a lot
of people their sub count.

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:42.895
-Twenty seconds remain.
-What? What? What?

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:44.363
Don't distract me
right now, Chandler.

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:45.398
Here, you wanna see my answer?

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:46.532
Yeah, I wanna see your answer.

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:47.867
Wait, zero is behind
[indistinct]

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.935
[Mark] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm saying.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.703 line:0%
[MrBeast] Okay. Ten seconds.

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:52.538 line:0%
Three, two, one.

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:54.273 line:0%
All right.
Put your pens down.

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:59.245 line:0%
The number is 233,042,520

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:01.280 line:0%
-is everyone's subscribers, so.
-[man] Wow.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:02.715 line:0%
You guessed it, bro.

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:04.383 line:0%
[MrBeast]<i> No one was even close
 to ZHC's answer.</i>

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:06.986 line:0%
All right.
Congratulations, Zach.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.254
[ZHC] Aye!

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:09.822
[MrBeast] Give it a kiss.

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:12.358 line:0%
Now we have four of our ten
contestants already picked out.

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:14.994
For this next challenge,
we filled the entire stadiums

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:17.630
with cardboard cutouts
and mannequins of Karl,

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:19.732
but one of these
is actually Karl

00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:23.269
and whoever touches
the Karl first moves on.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.371
You can go.

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:26.672
-[MatPat] Great.
-[man] Okay.

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.374
-[MatPat] Find Karl!
-[woman] No!

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:30.476
[Airrack] Oh, my gosh.
This man's running.

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:31.544
This man's running.

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:32.678
Okay. I'm looking around.

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:34.580
I'm looking for any movement.

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:36.549
[Ryan] Karl! This is so freaky.

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:38.584
[Karl] There are so many Karls.
They can't find me.

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:39.719
Where's this man?

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:41.321
[Zach] I'm gonna find you, Karl.

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:43.856
He's upstairs.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.591
Why are these mannequins
so realistic?

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:46.726
[MrBeast]
You're looking for Karl.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.561
He's around 6-foot tall.

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:49.729 line:0%
Jimmy said I'm 6-foot.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.030
If I had to guess,

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:52.765
I have a feeling
Bella's gonna win this one.

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:55.001
Wait, no, that means
she was on the right track?

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:57.370
Okay.
I'm following Bella.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:58.938
-[man]<i> Nope.</i>
-[Bella] Oh, my gosh.

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:00.706
[MrBeast] Hey,
that's just Chandler.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.742 line:0%
It's only a matter of time.
This is so nerve-wracking.

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:05.278
[Sofie] Oh, my God.

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:09.315 line:0%
Oh, I got him.

00:04:09.348 --> 00:04:10.883 line:0%
Congratulations,
you found me.

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:12.051
I was almost gonna go back.

00:04:12.084 --> 00:04:13.586
[Airrack] They're right there.

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:15.288
I was literally
on the right floor.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:16.555 line:0%
So far, we have half

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:18.424 line:0%
of our 10 contestants
picked out.

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:19.792 line:0%
And if I was one of you ten,

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:21.327 line:0%
I would start
to get a little nervous.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.828
Second half
is when I turn it on.

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.697
Airrack has not said a word
in a very long time.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.998
-Leave me alone.
-He's getting pissed.

00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:27.933
Are you even
in this competition?

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:29.502
-Have you done anything?
-I'm trying!

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:30.903
I'm trying!

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:32.471
We have custom-made dolls

00:04:32.504 --> 00:04:34.040
of each one of you
that we're gonna load

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.675
into this cannon.

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.343 line:0%
And if you look out there,
you'll see a giant target.

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:39.712
Whoever lands
closest to the middle, wins.

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:42.815
-Here is your custom-made doll.
-[laughing]

00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:44.083
[all] Oh!

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:47.420 line:0%
Don't move.
I think this is a good angle.

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:50.823
-[man] Wow!
-[man] Whoo-hoo!

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:51.891 line:0%
That was actually not bad.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:53.759
Who's next?

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:55.628 line:0%
She's not tall enough
to see the scope.

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:56.896 line:0%
So she's gonna stand on Mat.

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:57.897 line:0%
This is called friendship.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.565
[Rosanna] Whoo!

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:01.500
[Karl] Wait,
that's actually really close.

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:02.935
[MrBeast] Oh.

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:04.704
That might be the winner.
I'm not gonna lie.

00:05:06.972 --> 00:05:08.541
-[man] Oh.
-[all] Oh!

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:09.842
All three shots
have made it on the target.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:10.910
They're much better
at shooting dolls

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:12.478
than I thought.

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:13.879
You don't wanna go
too low or too high, right?

00:05:13.912 --> 00:05:15.514
It's about
finding the sweet spot.

00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:16.949 line:0%
Look at him
explaining what he's about

00:05:16.982 --> 00:05:18.851 line:0%
to do even though
he's about to fail.

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:20.619
[MrBeast] Oh, okay.

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:23.889
-Oh, wow.
-[Chandler] Oh, aah.

00:05:23.922 --> 00:05:26.759
This is the story
of every Creator Games.

00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:31.531
[man] Okay. There it is.
There it is.

00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:33.966
That's the worst shot yet.

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.501
This is my doll and he's going

00:05:35.534 --> 00:05:37.670
right to the middle
of that target.

00:05:37.703 --> 00:05:38.905
[man] Oh.

00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:41.440
[Ryan] Oh! Yes!

00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:44.410 line:0%
-[Karl] Oh, my God.
-That's so close.

00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:46.445
Wait, I actually don't know
who's in the lead now.

00:05:46.478 --> 00:05:49.048
Everyone knows this is the most
accurate way of measuring.

00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:50.850
She's a thumb and a pinky away.

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:53.052
You're a little bit more
than a thumb and a pinky away.

00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:55.621 line:0%
Rose, congratulations
on moving on!

00:05:55.654 --> 00:05:57.857 line:0%

these nine Creators are going

head to head in a talent show
with Dr. Phil as the judge.

00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:03.996
Hey, guys.

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.498
The contestants keep asking me,

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:06.799
do you have any idea
what you'll judge on?

00:06:06.832 --> 00:06:09.502
So if I throw up, bad.
If I don't, good.

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.570
Mr. Doctor, it's a pleasure
to meet you today.

00:06:11.603 --> 00:06:12.805
-How are you?
-I'm better now

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:13.839
that I'm hanging out with you.

00:06:13.872 --> 00:06:14.974
Let's see this talent.

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:16.409
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:17.476
I'm coming to you, Doctor.

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:18.944
Oh, look at him go.

00:06:18.977 --> 00:06:20.679
[Airrack]
This is very dangerous.

00:06:20.712 --> 00:06:21.680
All right. Come on.

00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:23.883
[groans] My finger.

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:26.752
You got it, you got it.

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:27.887
You did it,
you did it, you did it.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.888 line:0%
[Airrack] I love you, Dr. Phil.

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.489 line:0%
-Well...
-Did I win or...

00:06:30.522 --> 00:06:33.092
-Well, we'll let you know.
-Up next is Lexi Rivera.

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:37.096
[crowd cheering]

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:42.001
That's all I've got.

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:44.069
What do you mean
that's all you got?

00:06:44.102 --> 00:06:45.771
That's pretty damn impressive.

00:06:45.804 --> 00:06:47.573
[MrBeast]<i> As the talent show
 went on, it became clear</i>

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:50.443
<i> that some contestants
 had more talent than others.</i>

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:53.846
[piano music playing]

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.482
3.14.

00:06:56.515 --> 00:06:58.117
[Dr. Phil] All right.
All right.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.853
Uh, what do you call
a late night talk show host

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:02.522
who lost his balance?

00:07:03.655 --> 00:07:05.057
Jimmy Fallin'.

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:11.831
That's just a normal
dollar bill, right?

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:14.767
Do some mark,
something I couldn't guess.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.968
I've got a handkerchief here.

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:17.803
I want you to go ahead
and hold this.

00:07:17.836 --> 00:07:20.072
-I've got it in there.
-Abracadabra?

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:22.508
Magic isn't real, Dr. Phil.

00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:23.542
I'm gonna cut.

00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:25.878
Is that your dollar, Dr. Phil?

00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.180
That is my drawing
on the dollar.

00:07:28.213 --> 00:07:30.015
Knife drop.

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:31.784
[MrBeast]<i> And now that they've
 all performed their talents,</i>

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:33.486
<i> it's time for Dr. Phil
 to pick his favorite.</i>

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.822
It comes down, I think, to...

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.592
I got to give it to Mark.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.527 line:0%

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.196
Congratulations, Mark.
You're moving on.

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:45.998
And we're heading
to the next challenge.

00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:47.900

 left but only three slots</i>

00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:50.569

<i> This is where things
 get serious.</i>

00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:54.774
Chandler,
reveal what's under that.

00:07:58.143 --> 00:08:01.981
Whoever flushes the toilet
and comes back here first, wins.

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:03.916
[indistinct chatter]

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:05.084
[Preston screaming]

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:07.119
Holy frick, they are so fast.

00:08:07.152 --> 00:08:09.788
Did he say
the entire freaking stadium?

00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:11.156
I don't think they realized

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:12.525
that they could
have just flushed this toilet.

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:14.627
[Zach] I'm gonna head upstairs.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.761
[Airrack] I mean,
the further I go,

00:08:15.794 --> 00:08:16.962
the better chance I'll have.

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:18.731
What kind of a challenge
is this?

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:20.533
I see Ryan over there.

00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:22.935
I hope they're having fun though

00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:24.236
looking for, you know, a toilet.

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:25.805
Probably not.

00:08:26.638 --> 00:08:27.806
[Ryan] No.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:29.242
[Preston] Wait.

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:34.013
-[Zach] Yes!
-[toilet bowl flushing]

00:08:34.947 --> 00:08:37.650
[Ryan] Done. Whoo!

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:38.818
[Preston] Flush!

00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:41.153
Let's go.

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:43.756
I think I got it.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.958
-[Airrack] No!
-[Zach] Whoo-hoo!

00:08:45.991 --> 00:08:49.595 line:0%
I can't believe it.
Oh.

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:51.564
Congratulations, Zach,
you're the best

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.699
at finding a bathroom
and flushing a toilet.

00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:55.901
And now only two of you
are moving on.

00:08:55.934 --> 00:08:58.671
For this next challenge,
we have seven bowling lanes

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.005
each with one hundred pins.

00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:02.608
Whoever knocks down
the most pins moves on.

00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.177
And this first lane
has MatPat's face on it.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.845
So you're going first.

00:09:06.878 --> 00:09:09.114
Bowling is kind of a religion
in my extended family.

00:09:09.147 --> 00:09:11.584
-It doesn't matter, just bowl.
-Great.

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:12.751
[MrBeast] Okay. It's off.

00:09:12.784 --> 00:09:14.620
-[MatPat] Oh.
-[MrBeast] Let's see it.

00:09:14.653 --> 00:09:16.055
Oh, that was right on.

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:18.023
[MatPat] Whoa, keep going,
keep going, keep going!

00:09:18.056 --> 00:09:20.025
Whoo! I'll take it.

00:09:20.058 --> 00:09:22.094 line:0%
You knocked out 86 pins.

00:09:22.127 --> 00:09:24.129
I don't know if that's gonna be
strong enough to win.

00:09:24.162 --> 00:09:26.031
I suck at bowling.

00:09:26.064 --> 00:09:27.199
[MrBeast] Bowl-a Poarch.

00:09:27.232 --> 00:09:28.367
Oh, in the side.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.203
[woman] Whoo!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

00:09:31.236 --> 00:09:33.939
[MrBeast] Oh, wait.
Whoa!

00:09:33.972 --> 00:09:36.175
[MatPat] What?
Are you kidding me?

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:37.743 line:0%
She only knocked down 84.

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:38.877 line:0%
Mat is still in the lead.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.246 line:0%

Hey, Lexi,
I've been there before.

00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:57.262
Oh, these, like,
get me nervous.

00:09:57.295 --> 00:09:59.698
Preston, you've lost
a bunch of challenges.

00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:01.934
Is he better than MatPat?
Let's find out.

00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:03.168
It doesn't look like he is.

00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:05.070
[Preston] Whoa, oh.

00:10:05.103 --> 00:10:06.905
[MrBeast] No,
I'm not even gonna count it.

00:10:06.938 --> 00:10:08.874
The only person standing
between you and competing

00:10:08.907 --> 00:10:10.709
for a million dollars
is this man.

00:10:10.742 --> 00:10:11.910
Brothers to the end.

00:10:11.943 --> 00:10:13.312
-[Airrack] Ah.
-[MatPat] Sike!

00:10:13.345 --> 00:10:15.180
[all] Oh!

00:10:15.213 --> 00:10:16.816
[MrBeast] Airrack versus MatPat.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.687
That's a good one.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.689
Oh, it's close,
it's close, it's close.

00:10:23.722 --> 00:10:25.324
[MrBeast] I'm gonna
give a precise count.

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:26.392

[MatPat] Yeah!

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.265
I'm devastated.

00:10:33.298 --> 00:10:34.967
He's moving on and we're moving
on the next challenge.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.069
And now it's time
for the final challenge

00:10:37.102 --> 00:10:38.937
