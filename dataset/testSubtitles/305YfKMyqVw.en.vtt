00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.832
- All right, so Apple's
Wonderlust event happened.

00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:04.920
It was pretty interesting.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.530
Honestly, not that much
stuff actually got announced.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.730
I mean, we knew it was gonna
be iPhone, Apple Watch, USB-C,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.020
not that much other stuff.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.880
But it was more the stuff
in between the lines

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.840
that was kind of interesting

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.400
and some other random stuff

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.560
that I don't think a lot of
people are talking about.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.393
So let's talk about it.

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:21.300
Now, first of all, I gotta say,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.970
it was a complete surprise to me

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.260
when one of the first things that they did

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.940
was quote my MacBook Air review.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.560
So you know, like, the
beginning of the keynotes

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.393
they usually do

00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:30.540
where they sort of recap a bunch of stuff

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.860
that's previously happened?

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.200
One of the things they did was
talk about the MacBook Air,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.070
and this happened.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.460
- And Marques Brownlee said,
"The 15-inch MacBook Air

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.580
is going to instantly rocket
to the top of the lineup

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.420
to become the most
popular 15-inch laptop."

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.203
We love the new MacBook Air
and the entire Mac lineup.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.730
- And that was pretty cool.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.350
I gotta say, they didn't tell
me they were gonna do that.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.870
They didn't ask. They didn't pay for it.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.790
They just kind of did it.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.710
So shout-out to Tim.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.960
I guess in this case, it's totally fine.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.490
I guess there's just an
element of pride knowing

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.620
that, like, it's come a long
way since the beginning.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.900
I remember like 6, 7, 8 years ago

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.990
when there was zero YouTubers
at any of these events,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.670
and then there was one

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.050
and then there were three or four

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.730
and then there were 12 or 13

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.100
and just now we're all
just a part of the media,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.510
independent creators doing our thing.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.300
So I feel like it's kind of a cool moment

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.860
to see that come full circle.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.693
But anyway, after that,

00:01:26.693 --> 00:01:28.140
they just got right
into the announcements,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.870
the flagship of which
being the new iPhone.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.300
So I made an entire separate
video on the iPhones,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.820
my first hands-on and impressions
of all the little details

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.590
and my first thoughts of everything.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.850
So I'll link that below the Like button

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.410
if you wanna check it
out if you're interested.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.540
But I'll just do a brief
summary here for you.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.570
So the iPhone 15 gets the A16 Bionic chip

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.370
from last year's iPhone Pro.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.190
It gets the Dynamic Island, of
course, from the Pro as well.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.890
Some new colors and a
slightly updated design

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.830
with little better curve radiuses, radii,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.780
a slightly nicer feel in the hand,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.980
and a satin soft-touch
back and a slow USB-C port.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.620
Same starting price and
screen sizes as last year,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.120
799 for the iPhone 15

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.640
and 899 for the iPhone 15 Plus.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.800
So then the iPhone 15 Pro gets

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.290
a new three-nanometer A17 Pro chip.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.540
There's these new brushed
lighter titanium rails

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.070
to replace the stainless steel,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.020
a faster USB-C port,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.330
a customizable action button on the side

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.070
to replace the mute switch,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.390
a new set of cameras,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.040
and just the 15 Pro Max gets
a new 5x telephoto camera.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.660
And the prices are kind of sneaky.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.630
So it's still 999 for the 15 Pro

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.870
but the Pro Max now starts at 1,199

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.390
because it's also starting at 256 gigs.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.223
There's a lot more details

00:02:40.223 --> 00:02:41.640
and interesting stuff about the iPhone

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.630
in that hands-on video,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.680
so you know where to find that.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.820
But then there's the
other stuff of this event.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.860
Also, I thought it would
be cool to shoot here

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.693
since this is part

00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:52.980
of where they shot some
scenes in the keynote,

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.960
but now I'm realizing
that it's a real place.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.550
There's like chainsaws in the background.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.780
So sorry about the noise.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.690
Anyway, we've got Apple
Watch stuff, right?

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.980
So Series 9 and Ultra 2.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.970
And one of the most interesting things

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.070
about these new watches

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.440
is that visually, just looking at them,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.450
there's almost no way to actually tell

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.650
that you're looking at the new watch.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.850
It's very unlike Apple.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.890
So I think there's a new
pink color with the Series 9,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.710
but other than that, it looks
identical to the Series 8

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.080
and the Ultra 2 looks
identical to the Ultra.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.810
But instead, under the hood,
there's a big process update

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.790
to this new S9 system on a chip,

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.980
which is more powerful and more efficient,

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.930
and that's allowing
them to push the watches

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.150
to a higher max brightness

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.980
while keeping the same
quoted battery life.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.120
So the Series 9 is gonna get

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.580
up to 2,000 nits max brightness now

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.160
and the Ultra 2 is up to 3,000 nits,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.830
which is actually now, it's
the brightest display ever

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.790
on any Apple product.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.220
And they've also moved all
Siri requests on the watch now

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.510
to stay on device

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.479
instead of always having to do
a round trip to the internet,

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.100
which I think could help,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.690
'cause there's a lot of instances of Siri

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.990
where you, like, ask it,
"What's the time in Cupertino?"

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.450
And it goes, "Hold on a second.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.790
Wait for it. I'm thinking about it.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.623
I don't know yet,"

00:04:03.623 --> 00:04:05.220
and it's just frustrating
and it doesn't work.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.500
So that should be faster
and more efficient.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.210
It doesn't mean Siri's gonna be good.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.510
It just means it'll be bad but faster.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.880
But then there's also a
new Ultra Wideband chip

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.410
that can talk to the iPhones

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.440
to make Find My iPhone way more precise

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.180
and actually point out a direction

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.260
to help you find your phone

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.670
instead of just playing a sound.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.920
I think that's gonna be super
useful for a lot of people.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.710
But the most sneaky, interesting
update here to the watch

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.077
is this new double tap gesture.

00:04:31.077 --> 00:04:33.990
So, so, okay, you've got the new watch on

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.090
and, basically, it's always able to detect

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.010
if you do this double tap

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.290
of your thumb and your
index finger together.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.900
And so I got to try it a
bunch of times at the event

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.060
with a demo watch in the hands-on area.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.610
It actually seemed very accurate.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.320
Like, you basically, you raise it to wake,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.340
give it a split second,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.880
and then double tap to
press the primary button

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.320
of whatever app you're in

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.910
that's on your screen at the moment.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.640
So it can accept or reject
an incoming phone call

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.170
or stop a timer

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.270
or scroll through the
Smart Stack of widgets

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.800
on the watch face.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.710
And yeah, it was working really
well for me very quickly.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.700
This would clearly be super
helpful if my other hand is busy

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.840
or I'm holding something

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.670
or I just wanna quickly do something.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.770
Ordinarily, honestly, I
would be trying to do that

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.603
with my nose.

00:05:17.603 --> 00:05:19.140
So this is much better.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.850
Now, the reason I say this is sneaky

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.900
is because I don't know if you remember,

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.360
just a few weeks ago or months ago,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.870
this is the same gesture
used to select things

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.210
while you're wearing Apple Vision Pro.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.630
In the VR headset, selecting
things is like this.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.860
And so now on the watch,
selecting things is like that.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.080
Now, some of you have already
pointed out on Twitter

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.290
this isn't exactly new completely.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.060
If you've ever dug through
the accessibility settings

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.893
on the Apple Watch before,

00:05:45.893 --> 00:05:47.550
you've probably found by
a slightly different name

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.680
basically the exact same feature

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.420
and you've been able to double tap

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.832
and do all kinds of other things.

00:05:52.832 --> 00:05:56.400
Now, why isn't this new double tap

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.920
to select primary stuff feature

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.300
coming to other Apple watches,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.890
you might be asking.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.730
Apple says that basically this
new S9 chip is much faster

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.040
at processing all the info
from all those sensors

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.200
and so you'll be able
to do it more readily.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.120
And so that's why it's only coming

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.823
to the new S9-powered Apple watches.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.523
It's convenient.

00:06:16.523 --> 00:06:17.640
But let's talk about AirPods real quick

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.150
because this might actually
be the ultimate sneaky update.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.270
So the fact is these
barely even got mentioned

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.380
during the keynote, right?

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.580
Like, they just casually dropped

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.580
that there would be a new USB-C
case for the AirPods Pro 2

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.080
in, like, one fleeting slide

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.370
and that was basically it.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.270
So you could be led to believe

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.490
that there's just nothing new
with the AirPods themselves

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.440
and they're exactly the same.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.273
But you'd be wrong.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:40.770
So basically, for all
intents and purposes,

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.030
AirPods Pro 2 with the wireless
charging Lightning case

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.390
and AirPods Pro 2 with the
wireless charging USB-C case

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.180
are the same product with a different port

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.510
unless you have Apple Vision Pro,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.710
in which case, the USB-C
version will be capable

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.100
of doing lossless audio with low latency

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.390
with this new codec

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.370
that Apple has created
just for this purpose,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.980
this awesome immersive experience.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.960
So if you don't have Apple Vision Pro,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.520
then they're basically the same product

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.810
with two different ports,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.760
but there is actually new
hardware and new architecture

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.910
to make this feature possible
with the new USB-C version.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.410
I don't think they wanna
talk about that too much

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.120
to not make people who
just bought them last week

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.990
feel too bad about it,

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.970
but they're actually different headphones.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.230
So that's a sneaky update right there

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.190
from Apple behind the scenes

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.125
on one of their most popular products.

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:32.490
But that's a good transition

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.730
just to get to the last
seemingly big pillar

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:36.630
of this announcement,

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.870
which was carbon neutrality
and the environment.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.390
So Apple couldn't stop
talking about the environment

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.440
throughout this keynote,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.370
including one huge overly
self-congratulatory,

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.780
like, 10-minute skit

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.310
in the middle of the keynote video

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.880
with Tim Cook and Apple employees
talking to Mother Nature

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.440
about how much progress they've made

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.000
with their products environmentally.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.210
I just basically want to
dig more into this later.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.680
I would say I'm not an expert on this,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.770
so there's no way that I
can fully appreciate now

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.540
and fully understand now
everything that was said.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.610
There's a lot of specific language used.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.780
Some of it is very clear,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.450
like just straight up not
using any leather anymore

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.790
in any Apple products,

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.610
using recycled materials
instead of new virgin materials,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.443
things like that,

00:08:18.443 --> 00:08:20.160
having more sustainable energy sources.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.480
But then there's other things that they,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.800
I mean, there was a lot.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.940
There was a lot going on

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.890
and some of it is not quite as simple.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.370
But they have clearly made
a lot of progress and change

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.750
and they eventually landed on this moment

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.760
where they were like, "The
Apple Watch is the first

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.050
fully carbon neutral product

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.700
that Apple's actually shipping,"

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.550
on their way to ideally
being fully carbon neutral

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.650
as a company by 2030.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.690
And so there's a lot of progress

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.740
that they still need to make.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.760
And as much as we've talked

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.430
about how much Apple still needs to do,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.950
I kind of feel like I
can't get mad at this.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.090
Like, you know what it feels like,

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.010
you ever see those like YouTube videos

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.710
where a YouTuber on the
street, they'll be micd up

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.240
and they'll, like, give a homeless person

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.920
a hundred bucks or something

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.960
and half the comments
are like, "Oh, come on,

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.630
you clearly didn't have
to do it on camera.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.190
Like, if you really cared,

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.070
then you would do it not on camera."

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.260
And that's probably all mostly true,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.050
but also, that person in need

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.880
still did just get a hundred bucks.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.360
So it's like some net
positive was still done.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.710
And this kind of feels the same way to me.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.790
Like, okay, Apple is actually
doing a bunch of stuff

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.230
to use recycled materials

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.690
and to make less of an
impact on the environment

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.640
and then they're doing a
big song and dance about it

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.380
so everyone can see it,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.630
so that everyone sees it.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.180
And so you'd say, "Okay,
if they really cared,

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.500
they would do a whole bunch more stuff."

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.390
And that's still true,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.860
but I can't get mad at the improvements

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.870
that they are actually making.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.860
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.630
Either way, like I
said, I'm not an expert.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.830
I wanna dig more into this.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.730
I wanna talk to some people

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.010
who actually are experts
on it who can help me out

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.410
and maybe that's a future
topic for another video.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.900
But that's just my thoughts and reactions

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.070
from the Wonderlust event of 2023.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.120
Let me know what your thoughts are below.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.200
There's a lot to talk about

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.060
and a lot of random, sneaky stuff

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.000
and the comments section is
always open to talk about it.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.440
And techtember rolls on.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.280
So stick with us.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.270
Subscribe if you haven't already.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.890
Thanks for watching.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.290
Catch you guys later. Peace.

00:10:13.151 --> 00:10:15.734
(upbeat music)
