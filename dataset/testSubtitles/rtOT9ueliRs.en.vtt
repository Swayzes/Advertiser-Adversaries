00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.871
You open up this suitcase, and their eyes light up with wonder, until they ask...

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.373
It's just a big laptop.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:09.275
No way, man. It's a TV.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.745
Ugh, it weighs like 30 pounds.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:15.181
Well, yeah, because it's a home theater in a box!

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.984
How much is it?

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.956
How much does it cost?

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.960
The LG StandbyMe Go, spelt like...

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.829
I am claiming to have written the hit Eminem song,

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.035
Now Leave is a briefcase system designed for entertainment on the go.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:39.439
Inside this box is everything you need for movie night...

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:40.540
in the woods.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.979
A bright 27-inch smart display, four speakers in stereo configuration,

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.214
and a battery to power the whole thing.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.850
But none of that is what made us want to talk about it.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.522
It's rare that a device splits our team's opinions this cleanly.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.657
On the one hand, we've got the pragmatists,

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.460
who expect the most performance for their dollar.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.862
They aren't thrilled with this thing.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:08.301
But then we've got the gadget geeks, who are always excited to see cool new ideas.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.870
And the Stand by Me Go is certainly that.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.977
It's eye-catching, it's different, it's kind of cool, but is it good?

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:20.713
Let's find out after this quick message from our sponsor.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:21.414
Vessi.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:26.853
Protect your feet from precipitation and perspiration with Vessi and their Dymatex technology.

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:31.357
Check them out at the link below and use code LINUSTECHTIPS to get 15% off.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:34.627
For fun, this is my first actual hands-on with this thing.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:40.233
And the real question is, is it cool to have my own little home theater in the woods?

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.936
I gotta say, I kind of thought it was gonna be stupid,

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.038
but immediately I'm looking at it going,

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:48.074
this would have come in handy so many times.

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:51.111
I mean, it's more luggable than portable,

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:55.915
but the colors pop, the anti-glare performs way better than I expected.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.318
Immediate impressions, kind of like it.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.519
It's a little cold today.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.222
Thankfully, I got my 3D down jacket, lttstore.com.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:07.760
But if I wanted to watch TV outside or play games, there's probably dumber solutions.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.498
Got little rubber corners on it for ruggedness.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.199
Oh, whoa, hi.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:15.668
Oh yeah, it does that.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:17.837
Oh yeah, it does.

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:20.306
Just in case you want that to happen.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:23.576
Given how close you're seemingly intended to sit to it,

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.912
1080p does feel like a bit of a compromise.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:29.282
But overall, there's gotta be dumber ways to solve this problem.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:33.820
We were pleasantly surprised to find that the display has pretty good color accuracy.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.856
This is in spite of a bit of overemphasis on the reds

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:41.828
and a color temperature that pushed cool by default for a little boost in luminance.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:42.962
Bit more on that later.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:46.232
We measured an average delta E of just 2.68.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.635
And in this vivid mode and plugged in,

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:51.504
we also measured around 500 nits peak brightness,

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:55.575
which is not amazing, but certainly usable.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:58.611
But wait, it says 250 when plugged in.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.581
250?

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:05.818
When you're on the beach, you get 250 nits?

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:07.520
450.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:09.756
Oh, okay.

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.058
A portable power station.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.895
That kind of defeats the purpose of this thing, don't you think?

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:20.934
So even though it's Dolby Vision and HDR10 compatible,

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.869
it's on battery performance,

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:27.273
250 nits peak with no local dimming

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:31.110
means that the highest thing about your high dynamic range

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.080
is probably going to be that fungus that you found behind a tree.

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:36.082
Or who knows?

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:37.417
Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.586
All right, Madrigals.

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:40.553
How are you going to look on this?

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.322
Oh my god.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.791
It switched into Dolby Vision mode and immediately it's like...

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:46.159
Dim.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.861
It switches out of the vivid mode,

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.530
so you can switch it back for a little color.

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:52.799
Or we can plug you in.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.936
It's not even broad daylight, guys.

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:59.439
It's freaking overcast and foggy.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.042
And this looks like I have my laptop screen in power saving mode.

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:05.011
This is on battery right now?

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:05.678
It's on battery.

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:06.546
Let's plug it in.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:07.347
Shoot, man.

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:09.015
That's not good.

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.417
I can't see s*** right now.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.519
Swipe from the top, see if the brightness is at max.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.053
It should be.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:14.454
Swipe?

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:15.421
Is this a touchscreen?

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.155
It's a touchscreen.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.391
Well, there's good news and bad news.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.460
Good news is the touchscreen works.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.261
The bad news is...

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:22.862
That's it, boss.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:25.331
This is not HDR.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.466
That's not a flame.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:27.200
That's white.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.671
This is not fire or lava or whatever the crap it's supposed to be.

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:33.339
It's yellow circles.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:36.142
And that's what the low peak brightness is going to do to you.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.577
What are these speakers going to do to you?

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:43.416
What a disappointment.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:52.458
They had this entire enclosure here and they put the speakers behind the screen.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:52.859
Hold on.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:54.861
The speakers are in here?

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:55.094
Yes.

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:56.162
Why?

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:02.935
All they had to do was put some angled drivers in here

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:08.374
so that they would actually hit you instead of bouncing off the back of the monitor.

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:12.145
Not trying to be a jerk about it or anything, but that's not how you do this.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:12.612
Nope.

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:17.984
If I do this and I sit here, it sounds way better.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:18.618
Yeah, you're right.

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:19.752
It's not impeded.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:20.953
Yeah, you're not wrong.

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:24.290
You don't build a speaker and then put a thing in front of it.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.191
Here's a thought though.

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:29.595
Maybe that Dolby Atmos label is less about clear dialogue in your movies

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:34.067
and more about pounding that bass when you're around the campfire.

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:34.934
Let's see how she fares.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:49.582
Wow.

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:50.783
It doesn't sound good from back here either.

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:55.755
Dude, they had all this room in it and they didn't put in a sub.

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:56.222
Yeah.

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:59.892
The next thing I've been asked to try is the ambient wallpaper.

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:01.894
So I like healing.

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:03.896
Why don't we fire up a cozy fireplace?

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:11.738
Now my next challenge is to turn off the screen

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:15.908
while my background music or audio plays in order to preserve battery life.

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:20.313
Oh, wow.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:21.748
WebOS is a little laggy on this thing.

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:22.782
Click.

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:28.321
Okay, I give up.

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:34.694
The only way is to use the voice controls that are disabled by default.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:35.995
Seriously?

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:37.830
I see.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.667
On a normal LG TV remote,

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:46.139
they have a button so that you can just talk at it when you want it to be listening.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.641
But on this one, I guess they cheaped out on the remote.

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:49.842
It doesn't have a button.

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:52.311
So it just has an always on threshold.

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.213
So it has to be disabled by default.

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:55.581
I see.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:56.883
Hi, LG.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:00.052
Turn off the display.

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:04.390
Okay, I'll turn off the screen.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.258
Thanks, TikTok.

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:06.626
Wow.

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:07.193
Well, there it is.

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:12.799
You can also use your LG phone app because you definitely have that installed.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:16.402
Video and music are just part of the pitch for the StandbyMe Go, though.

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:20.072
It's got some basic onboard processing, a touch display.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:26.078
And it can rotate, as I showed you guys before, to portrait mode.

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:28.614
So you can mirror your phone's display to it.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.082
As long as you twist it this way.

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:33.586
And it should be noted that we had somewhat mixed results with that.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:37.590
But what you can also do is load in some of the apps that are built into LG's webOS

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.626
or download new ones, including games.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:43.362
I'm going to play Billion Marble.

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.598
Oh, it's Monopoly.

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:47.333
How about a Philippine City?

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:47.733
Purchase.

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:49.735
Uh, okay.

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:51.571
How do I not this game?

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:55.975
It occurs to me now that I had asked for a particular game on Android because I forgot.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:56.375
Oh, right.

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:57.910
WebOS.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.213
They don't have Android games, necessarily.

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:01.514
Okay, can I can I dodge or?

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:02.715
You can move.

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:03.516
What is this game?

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:05.351
A tank battle, dude.

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:05.918
Come on.

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:06.953
Uh, okay.

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:11.190
Ah, my notes say that we experienced some responsiveness issues.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.560
Take that, Anakin.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.595
I have the high ground.

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:19.832
Even at its best, the webOS game library is going to make you wish you had

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.235
anything else attached to this thing.

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:24.237
The good news is you can.

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:25.571
All right, all right, all right, fine.

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:26.138
We'll go home.

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:27.907
Go to HDMI.

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.742
Oh, oh, it fell through the table.

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:30.710
Oh, that's not good.

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:35.748
I mean, look, if it couldn't survive that, then it's not really suitable for camping anyway.

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:39.919
But how's the motion clarity for you?

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:44.857
Being completely honest, I wasn't even paying attention to the motion clarity of this display.

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.692
Not because it's good.

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:47.493
It's really bad.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:52.298
But I just didn't really feel like that was the point of it.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:54.800
Here's a question.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.503
What if I just unplugged the ally and handed it to you?

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.540
Which one do you think is going to be better?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.875
Oh, wow.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.477
Is this ever a better display?

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:13.519
What's really embarrassing from my point of view is LG literally are the guys when it comes to IPS.

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:19.025
Why is this the cheapest, worst IPS panel?

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:20.960
Why do you even still make these ones?

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:28.634
The thing is, a lot of what I've said so far is evaluating it as a television, but it's unique.

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:30.636
So why don't we try something unique?

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:32.071
Let's play a two-player game.

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:33.839
Let's play the chess.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:34.707
The chess.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:35.841
I'm a big fan of the chess.

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:37.810
Do you chess?

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.210
Not really.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.345
Because I don't really chess.

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:41.347
I think we're both about to embarrass ourselves then.

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:42.315
It's okay.

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:43.983
I'm going to bring out my rook right away.

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:45.651
I'm going to be a pro.

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:46.319
Bring out my king.

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:47.520
What?

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:49.055
Okay.

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:51.490
I don't think pro works the way you think it works.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.692
I'm going to bring out both rooks.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.027
It's the two rook defense.

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:57.196
A country is only as strong as its king.

00:09:57.196 --> 00:10:01.434
A country is only as powerful as its pawns.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.102
Its loyal servants.

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:03.669
Check.

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:04.370
No!

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:05.905
You can kill it.

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:06.706
No, I don't want to.

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:07.506
You don't want to kill it.

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:08.874
I believe in peace.

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:10.543
If you guys want to see the whole chess game,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.412
lmg.gg slash floatplane.

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:14.380
We're going to have it up there.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.514
Why you run away, b****?

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:18.851
You're falling for one of the classic blunders.

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:22.655
What?

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:31.430
What?

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:35.301
That, I have no idea what happened.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:36.902
In all seriousness though,

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:41.540
there are other aspects of the device that we should talk about.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.810
Battery life is advertised at around three hours.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.812
We got four to five,

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.881
and that was streaming Disney Plus and YouTube.

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:52.551
The IO is both limited and good enough.

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:54.320
You've got a power in,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.855
a battery on and off button,

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:58.557
an IR blaster port,

00:10:58.557 --> 00:11:01.127
just in case you want to set up a relay.

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:02.161
A USB port,

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.996
which I could definitely see people using.

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:05.765
You bring along your little collection of videos

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:08.100
to watch in the tent or whatever the case may be.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.835
And a single HDMI port.

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:12.805
One thing that does feel a little conspicuously absent,

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:15.274
given that it's a smart TV,

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:17.376
is any kind of connectivity.

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:19.045
There's Wi-Fi, obviously,

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.479
but there's no ethernet jack.

00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:21.781
And maybe more importantly,

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:24.417
there's nowhere to put a SIM in it or anything like that.

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:26.719
So you're pretty much tethering to a phone

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:27.920
if you want a connection.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.288
And you'll need a connection

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:31.924
because there's no internal accessible storage.

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:33.693
Realistically though,

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.528
in spite of all of my complaints,

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:38.564
if you're the kind of person who wants a StandByMe Go,

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:40.099
whether it's for van life

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:42.568
or giving presentations on the road,

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:44.170
you already know who you are.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.872
And I'm honestly not here to argue that.

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:48.240
It's utterly unique.

00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:50.876
So why don't we focus then

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:54.180
on the ways that I feel LG could improve this experience

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.015
for the people who need something like this.

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.718
Losing almost half of our brightness

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.019
when we're away from power

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:01.220
is a huge downer.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.888
When the whole point of this thing

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:05.124
is to be away from power.

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:06.726
On top of that,

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.494
once the external juice is cut,

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:10.896
we saw some 240 Hertz flickering.

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.365
Remember, this is a 60 Hertz display,

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:15.434
meaning that there were duplication artifacts

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:17.036
in high motion scenes.

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:20.172
It's not a huge deal in most slow moving video content,

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:21.774
but it's definitely distracting

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:23.375
if you've got your PS5 hooked up

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:24.643
and you want to game.

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:25.911
Or wait, okay.

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:27.446
That's a bit of a problem too.

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:30.416
The StandByMe Go doesn't share power

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:31.684
with external devices.

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:33.219
It's like Sauron, okay?

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:34.954
So you're going to need a power station

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:37.857
for anything that is beefier than a USB drive

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:39.525
with your MP4s on it.

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:40.893
And at that point,

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:44.563
compact portable monitors go up to 24 inches now

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:47.767
and pair very nicely with stereo ready Bluetooth speakers

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.503
from the likes of JBL or Soundcore.

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:52.872
None of that is my biggest issue though.

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:55.441
My biggest problem is the cost.

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.310
You could buy a whole ass all-in-one computer

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.280
with a built-in battery like the HP Envy Move

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.016
for much less than the StandByMe Go.

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:07.620
And then you end up with a full fat Windows PC

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.322
instead of this weak webOS machine.

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:12.658
We're going to have links to some alternative suggestions

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:14.093
in the video description.

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:16.729
If this thing was 400, 500 bucks,

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.397
it's a winner.

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:20.499
And even at six, 700,

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:22.101
I still think it has a place.

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:24.170
But at $1,200,

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.139
look, if you like it, you like it.

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.574
It's not awful.

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:31.043
It's just, it's hard not to compare it

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:34.246
to existing less expensive solutions,

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.182
even if they are a little less elegant.

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.750
Like this inelegant segue.

00:13:38.717 --> 00:13:41.687
Oh no, to our sponsor.

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:42.488
Vessi.

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.323
Dreaming of long summer walks

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:45.991
during the cold winter months?

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.927
Well, don't let the rain fall down

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:49.295
and disrupt your dreams.

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:50.963
Walk free with Vessi.

00:13:51.063 --> 00:13:53.699
They claim their shoes are 100% waterproof

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:55.835
thanks to their Dymatex technology.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.603
Even the most torrential downpours

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:59.205
don't stand a chance.

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:01.207
The Chelsea and Stormburst shoes

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:03.542
are fantastic companions for the winter weather

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:04.977
with the comfort of a sneaker

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:07.379
and the warmth and higher top of a boot.

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:08.647
So you can treat your toes

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:11.283
while laughing at mother nature's futile attempts

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:13.619
to dampen your spirits and feet.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.688
And when the skies clear up,

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:17.990
their weekend and everyday classic sneakers

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.592
are great for just wearing about

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:21.193
while still offering enough protection

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:22.394
from the wet outdoors.

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:23.863
When you come home from your journey,

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.297
you will come in clean.

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:27.766

on the Maccase B21 briefcase PC?

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:42.882
It's somehow less sleek than this thing,

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.884
but it's definitely more powerful.
