00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.910
- We are currently surrounded
by countless sharks.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.230
Maybe even a thousand.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.100
I don't think it's that many.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.250
And in this backpack,
it's a hundred grand.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.770
And if you retrieve that a
hundred thousand dollars in cash,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.270
I'll give it to your number one fan.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.103
- Oh.

00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:13.936
- Who's conveniently right here.

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:14.957
- Oh!

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:15.790
- Let's go, Chris.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.623
Okay. Let's go baby.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.513
- There's literally shark-
look Tareq, Tareq, Tareq.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.987
- Oh my God.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.543
- The sooner you get the
money, the sooner you're out!

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:37.958
- Got it.

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:38.791
Oh really?

00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.624
Got it.

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:41.561
Gotta make it back.

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:42.394
Get back to this boat.

00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:46.950
- Here's your a hundred
thousand dollars in cash.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.400
If I was you, I'd kiss Chris.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.610
This is my friend Airrack.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.920
To your right is the
coldest room in the world.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.030
- It's freezing in here.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.230
- And to your left is the
hottest room in the world.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.063
- Youch!

00:00:57.063 --> 00:00:58.290
- Hot or cold? Pick.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.390
- They're both horrible
options, but I'm gonna go cold.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.220
Oh my gosh.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.660
Bro, this is freezing.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.860
- At least in here you have a bed.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.120
- What is this, Jimmy?

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.280
- Every hour you survive in this room,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.230
I'll give a random person 10 grand.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.610
- Starting right now?
- Starting now.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.443
- No.

00:01:12.443 --> 00:01:14.220
- The time starts now.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.140
- You better stay in there.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.110
I'm not leaving here
until you win millions.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.943
- That's right, man!

00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:21.930
You and I are gonna bankrupt Jimmy today.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.850
- This is what 10 grand
looks like by the way.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.950
- Hey, Hey, it hasn't been
an hour. Get outta here.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.970
We'll see you guys in a little bit.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.290
For this next challenge,

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.810
we brought back something
I know you all love.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.950
Glass Bridge.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.170
And we brought back 4,
5, 6 from our squid game.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.003
It's pretty simple.

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:36.690
You guess a platform left or right.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.520
If you pick wrong, you fall.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.260
And if you can make it to the other side

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.780
I'll let you keep the
456 grand over there.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.650
- 15 Platforms?

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.500
- I'm gonna give you a hand.
Pick right on the first one.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.533
- Oh.

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.130
- Now obviously the
probability of him getting

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.620
to the other side of this
bridge is extremely low.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.330
So I'm just gonna tell you the answers.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.170
You jumped right,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.910
then it's left, left, left,
right, right,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.110
left, left, left,
right, left,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.640
right, right, right left.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.500
You should get to jumping
before you forget.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.360
- All right. It's left for sure.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.020
- Correct. 13 more, John,
456 grand on the line.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.853
- This one

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.930
- It was three lefts in a row.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.090
Sucks for 456.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.800
We brought back 067.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.573
The correct answer is right.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.330
And if you can make it
all the way to the end

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.760
I'll let you keep the
456 grand over there.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.017
I'm gonna give you all the rest.

00:02:25.017 --> 00:02:25.980
Right, left, left, left,
right, right, left, left,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.813
left, right, left,
right, right, right left.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:27.646
- Can I get that again?

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:28.479
- No.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.312
- Oh, all right.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.960
- Your heart looked like it stopped there.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.410
- It did.
if you could just-

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.634
- That's the good option.

00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:40.216
- Oh my God.

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:41.740
- That is not the good option.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.573
- Oh, are you okay?

00:02:42.573 --> 00:02:43.406
- Yeah.
I'm good.

00:02:43.406 --> 00:02:44.239
- I'm not gonna lie,

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.930
I thought they would
make it a little further.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.763
Chris.

00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:47.596
- Oh, no.

00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:49.140
So you have heard me say all the answers

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.430
to two different people?

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.782
- It's a bad time to
have a horrible memory.

00:02:52.782 --> 00:02:54.170
Oh gosh.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.380
Am I gonna die?

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.954
Am I waiting to die?

00:02:56.954 --> 00:02:59.460
- I am so glad you picked
the right one here.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.860
- No, I picked the left one.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.230
- Oh gosh. He went.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.260
I give up. Next bit.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.360
- So my plan as of right
now is to snuggle up

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.100
in this ice bed that Jimmy has made for me

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.463
and pretty much just sleep
through this entire day.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.820
- Now we're back at the
world's coldest room

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.447
and it's officially been an hour.

00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:20.400
So here's 10 grand.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.600
You've suffered for an hour.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.650
She's won 10 grand.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.910
How are you doing?

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.743
- I'm feeling like you need to go get more

00:03:24.743 --> 00:03:25.590
of those briefcases out.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.870
- Almost the entire time lapse
you're laying in the bed.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.800
Were you actually asleep?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.633
- I'm sleeping.

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:30.466
Yeah, it was great.

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:31.299
- Hey Chris.

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.700
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.631
- It's literally just sleeping.

00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:35.790
- You can't feel cold when you're asleep.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.045
- You know what to do.

00:03:37.045 --> 00:03:37.878
- Whoa!

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:41.678
- Crazy, buddy.

00:03:41.678 --> 00:03:42.660
We got the job done.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.493
- Where are we?

00:03:43.493 --> 00:03:44.520
- Go take a nap.
- Okay.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.750
I'll see you in a couple more hours.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.583
We're gonna go film.

00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:47.520
- Why would you do that?

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.850
- We are now on top of
a 1000 foot tall canyon.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.754
- I'm terrified.

00:03:51.754 --> 00:03:54.720
- And if you're crazy
enough to cross this canyon

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.070
on just that slack line,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.290
I'll let you keep the 20
grand on the other side.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.190
- I'm pretty nervous.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.470
The wind keeps on picking
up and like slowing down.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.287
My goal is to get to the end
of the line where that 20 K is.

00:04:04.287 --> 00:04:06.270
- And my goal is for you not to fall.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.770
- Let's freaking go.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.300
- She is now descending onto it.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.860
The 20 thousand's on the other side.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.790
- Please don't fall.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.960
- I'll try not to.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.984
- Thank you.

00:04:13.984 --> 00:04:14.817
- All right. She's doing it.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.960
As long as she's not dangling
from the rope, she's still in.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.980
- She's fearless.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.360
- This is crazy.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.280
And while she's crossing,
I'm gonna tell you guys

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.140
about experian, which is a free mobile app

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.000
that lets you take control
of your credit score.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.768
I can't even focus on the
ad because this is so crazy.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.170
- You got this, just focus.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.003
- Take your time.

00:04:32.003 --> 00:04:33.720
This app gives you access
to your credit score

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.800
and helps you improve it.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.630
experian also has experian Boost.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.190
So you can basically
leverage things like your

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.170
cell phone bills, your
utility bills, even things

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.390
like Hulu and Netflix to
build your credit score.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.740
Do you know what your credit score is?

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.730
- No idea.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.900
- Okay. Sorry. Don't worry about it.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.090
Boost is only used on
your positive payment.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.350
So if you have a late payment,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.760
it won't hurt your FICO score.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.680
- The money's right here.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680
- Oh my Lord.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.550
- She is not looking.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.390
She's so focused.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.000
- This can obviously help you
qualify for affordable loans

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.738
that you can then use to buy
a car, a house or a yacht.

00:04:59.738 --> 00:05:01.661
- Sup guys. How's it goin'?

00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:03.900
- I'm just holding your prize.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.850
- People on average using experian Boost

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.880
saw a 13 point increase
on their FICO score.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.830
She's almost there.

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.776
Oh my goodness.

00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:13.609
- Oh God.

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:14.442
- Oh my goodness.

00:05:14.442 --> 00:05:16.251
- Woo. Oh, thanks guys.

00:05:16.251 --> 00:05:19.470
That's one of the scariest
things I've ever had to do.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.910
Thank you so much, Jimmy!

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.990
Download experian.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.160
- Just click the link in the description

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.030
and download experian now.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.805
And congratulations on 20 grand.

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:28.560
Meanwhile, Airrack's
been freezing for hours.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.230
- Five. Not that anybody's counting.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.403
I am so bored, but more than
that, I am horribly cold.

00:05:35.403 --> 00:05:36.930
- How you doing in there?

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.457
She's starting to win
some pretty serious money.

00:05:38.457 --> 00:05:40.050
- Yeah. That's the goal.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.400
I'm gonna bankrupt you!

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.233
- That's scared me.

00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:43.770
Somehow he was still going strong,

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.630
so we decided to crank up the difficulty.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.310
Hey, see the timer?

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.290
It's paused until you give us your hoodie.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.080
- What if I give you the hoodie
but you give her 10 grand?

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.913
- But shake on it.

00:05:52.913 --> 00:05:54.030
I'll give her 10 grand for your hoodie.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.185
- Okay.

00:05:55.185 --> 00:05:56.550
- Oh my gosh. His hand's cold.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.960
All right, bye.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.793
Here's the thing.

00:05:58.793 --> 00:05:59.940
We're not forcing you to stay in there.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.900
- Are you bankrupt yet?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.769
- No. I have tons of money.

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:03.060
- I'm staying.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.152
I hate those guys.

00:06:04.152 --> 00:06:07.020
- This is Marcus and in
front of us is 40 grand.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.160
You have two options.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.810
You can either steal this 40 grand

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.360
and keep it all to yourself or split it

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.070
with a random person you will never meet.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.650
We also brought back this
guy that was stolen from

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.610
in a previous video.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.443
- Wanna steal it then.

00:06:18.443 --> 00:06:20.070
- The guy that lost out on 10 grand

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.210
is gonna be watching this.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.043
- Wait, what?

00:06:22.043 --> 00:06:23.160
- Let's see if his luck got better.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.180
- What do you think he's gonna pick?

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.013
- Steal.

00:06:25.013 --> 00:06:26.200
- You think he's gonna steal?

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.243
- Steal.

00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:30.076
- You don't even wanna think on it?

00:06:30.076 --> 00:06:31.174
- Not even thinking about it.

00:06:31.174 --> 00:06:32.613
- Oh my God.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.853
- What I tell you?

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:35.686
- Sorry bud.

00:06:35.686 --> 00:06:36.940
- Oh man.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.773
That's painful.

00:06:37.773 --> 00:06:38.606
He's looking at the camera.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:39.439
That is not good.

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.272
So messed up.

00:06:40.272 --> 00:06:41.654
Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:41.654 --> 00:06:43.050
He's taking a money bath.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.615
He's swimming in it right now.

00:06:44.615 --> 00:06:45.448
That's a good day he had.

00:06:45.448 --> 00:06:46.281
- He's having a good day.

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.000
- I'm gonna go talk to the
guy who just lost 20 grand.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.930
How's it going?

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.050
This guy was so much worse
than the girlfriend before.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.920
- Didn't hesitate.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.660
Right? He's taking pictures
right now with Chris.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.010
Oh, you're forever gonna be here.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.540
Are we just gonna keep going until someone

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.650
actually splits it?

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.032
And now we're inside the
alligator capital of the world.

00:07:01.032 --> 00:07:03.210
And as you can see, there
are literally hundreds

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.220
of alligators all around this place.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.690
And three can I borrow the camera?

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.370
Do you see those two
briefcases over there?

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.960
There's $20,000 in them.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.003
If you go retrieve it, I'll
let you keep the money.

00:07:12.003 --> 00:07:12.990
- Not doin' it.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.640
I'm not doing it either.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.780
I didn't even get to ask you.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.613
I'm gonna be honest.

00:07:16.613 --> 00:07:18.175
I knew the boys would say no

00:07:18.175 --> 00:07:19.290
which is exactly why I brought Brian.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.390
He spent his entire life handling animals

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.710
and I know he's gonna attempt it.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.543
- Absolutely.

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:24.376
- Unlike Tareq.

00:07:24.376 --> 00:07:25.209
- Tareq, you're a wimp.

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:26.760
- All right. So Brian,
I don't know if you see

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.409
but there's an alligator at your feet.

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:31.293
- He's just really
jumping in there with it.

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:33.327
- You just get out there

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.080
- Get back here, back to
back, back, back, back back.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.913
You go away.

00:07:37.913 --> 00:07:38.746
You go away.

00:07:40.373 --> 00:07:41.973
Nice Jimmy, why am I doing this?

00:07:44.098 --> 00:07:45.330
- The alligator didn't like that.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.740
You should step lightly.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.677
- This alligator right here's like,

00:07:47.677 --> 00:07:48.870
"hey guys, can I be on camera?"

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.220
They want some screen time.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.403
Only two more steps.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.380
Congratulations, Brian,
on winning $20,000.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.300
How are you gonna get off that island?

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.680
- I didn't think about that.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.880
- Oh!

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.713
- I didn't either.

00:08:12.713 --> 00:08:14.020
I'm gonna go to the next bit.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.910
- I am so cold.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.830
I've never been this
cold in my entire life.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.133
Ugh, Eve I have nothing left.

00:08:22.133 --> 00:08:23.670
I have to get out.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.780
- It's okay, man.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.730
- Buddy, you look a
little cold over there.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.045
- I'm freezing.

00:08:28.045 --> 00:08:29.130
- You just crossed another hour mark.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.297
So here's another 10 grand.

00:08:30.297 --> 00:08:32.332
- Do we feel good with 80 grand?

00:08:32.332 --> 00:08:33.165
- Yes.

00:08:33.165 --> 00:08:33.998
- Okay. We're done.

00:08:33.998 --> 00:08:34.831
Oh boy.

00:08:36.608 --> 00:08:37.441
Outta here.

00:08:37.441 --> 00:08:38.274
Oh my gosh.

00:08:39.148 --> 00:08:41.010
- Congratulations on winning this

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.350
80 grand in cash. Bring it in.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.490
We're going to the hottest room.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.330
- Stop. Stop.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.380
You can't go from the coldest room

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.210
in the world to the
hottest room psychopath.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.650
Most of the contestants you saw
