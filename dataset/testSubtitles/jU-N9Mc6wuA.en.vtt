00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380
Building your first PC from parts can be frustrating, but with our videos

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.980
It should be easy even if you're a total noob

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.800
At least that's the theory. To benchmark the quality of our teaching

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.000
We've assembled a dream team made up of the only people shorter than me at the company

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.280
Oh my god

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.460
Olamide and Maria. Ladies, have either of you built a computer before?

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.560
No, never.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.640
That's a bit of a problem because you are going to be racing

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.280
Against me to see who can build a gaming rig the fastest.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.180
Wait, what?

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.380
Did they not tell you?

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.600
No, they know nothing.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.600
Oh, that's great

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.040
Hey, but we don't know anything about this

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.540
Don't worry

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.120
You guys are gonna be on a team against me and you can watch any YouTube videos you want

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.520
As long as they're from LTT

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.780
And you guys are gonna get some lifelines. You'll get some extra help

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.620
I on the other hand will be given a more challenging build, but this looks the same actually

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.100
Oh does it?

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100
Hardline water cooling

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.160
Okay

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.940
Like this okay segue to our sponsor

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.940
That's bad

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.580
MSI if you're MSI-ing a new motherboard the MPG Z790 Carbon Wi-Fi 2 is a great option

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.660
With features like a pre-installed IO shield and Wi-Fi 7 compatibility

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.180
There's no reason you shouldn't pick one up at the link below. No, that's a thumbs down link below

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.740
Each team will be equipped with our wits these tools including the gorgeous retro edition LTT screwdriver

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.100
LTTstore.com and two hours

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.660
At the end our builds will be judged with penalties and bonuses depending on our speed and the quality of our work

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.340
Games master David will explain all of that as we go. Maria, Olamide, feeling confident?

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340
Yes, kind of

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.020
As long as we can see a video of someone. Of you building a PC. I'm just someone now

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.860
Before we start can we go lower?

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.860
On the short end of the stick. Really? This seems like a pretty good height. Really? Can we?

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.860
Seems fine.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.860
You're almost our height.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.860
Oh my god. Why is it going down?

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.860
Oh it's still going down. Oh my god. Stop.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.860
What's going on?

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.860
Is this an okay height for you guys? No.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.460
Come on I never get to be the one making the short jokes. Three, two, one, go!

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.980
Okay, where should we

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.580
Watch the video here? Yeah, yeah

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.620
You can bring that laptop with you over here if you want. Under normal circumstances in one of these competitions

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.980
I would fool around a little bit, but I have been burned time and time again doing that

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.740
So instead I'm gonna get things going. Our builds today are based on our standard workstations for a few reasons

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.980
One, we already had multiples of these components kicking around the office. So that's

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.180
convenient. Two, these parts were picked for easy assembly in the first place and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.840
Three, it means that when we're done, we can just deploy these systems to our team

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.100
Convenient. How would you rate your technical ability out of ten?

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.100
Eight?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.100
I don't know

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.100
Eight?

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.100
But I mean yeah

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.420
Yeah, I feel like you know, eight, ten. Do you think that computers and sewing machines have a lot in common? No

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.860
For our CPU we've gone with the core i5-13600k

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.980
It's got 14 cores and it's just generally good bang for the buck

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.220
Also, unlike its roided out i9 cousins, it is pretty darn power efficient

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.060
Don't, oh Maria, don't stop you're gonna want to keep going. I feel like we're gonna take forever

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.220
Yeah, I mean we chose the easiest gaming PC build video and

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.100
Linus said here it was so hard to screw it up. So hopefully we're good. Am I allowed to help them?

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.620
Yeah, of course

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.180
If you want to lose. Yeah, are you guys into POV content? This one is really easy to follow along with. Okay, perfect

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.500
It's a little bit less modern, but this one's really good

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.180
And then if there's any details you want to use how to build a PC the last guide you'll ever need

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.940
I should have just let them struggle, but I can't I want to I want a healthy competition. Okay

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.700
For SSD, we've gone with the Crucial P5+. We like these because they're cheap. We don't put any data on our workstations

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.220
It's actually against company policy. Everything is supposed to be on a redundant and backed up server

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.500
No DRAM cache, but they have a five-year warranty and have proven to be very reliable in our deployments

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.980
I need to tell you guys about the lifelines you get so you get a medium help

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.260
Which is me coming there and I'll be able to instruct you but I can't touch anything for two minutes

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.740
Okay, and then you're also gonna get a video call with someone much more knowledgeable than me Jordan

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.460
You'll get another two minutes with him

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.540
You have to match it with the dot at the corner of the socket, but I don't see there's no dot

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.380
Wait, wait, wait. Yeah

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.380
For our RAM, we've gone with some Trident Z5 DDR5 6000 CL30

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.740
It's not the tightest but it's definitely sufficient for office use. Okay CPU installed

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.820
I think. I gave Linus every possible out on hardline watercooling making it simpler

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.140
But he assured me he could do this in two hours

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.140
I don't know if there's any orientation. Can we ask David maybe?

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.460
David, David. Do you want to use your lifeline?

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.900
We have two hours with you, right? You have two minutes with me. Two minutes

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.940
Okay, David

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.540
There's an orientation for the RAM like yeah

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.460
So if what I would do is I would line it up and see where the notch in the RAM lines up with the notch

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.900
Here Linus you want to use slots two and four right furthest away from the

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.700
Am I being asked for tech tips right now? That's that's what you do

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.060
Here's a tech tip open up the box and find your manual

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.580
Ah

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.500
For our motherboards, we're using the Asus ProArt Z790 Creator, which is

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.100
Very much a necessary overkill. We've talked about this on WAN show

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.900
But Asus insisted on sending some sick gear over if it meant that they could watch Linus lose

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.940
What do you mean watch Linus lose? I'm not losing

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.660
It's got 10 gig Ethernet Wi-Fi 6e dual Thunderbolt 4 ports

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.260
PCIe Gen 5 and 4 M.2 slots Linus

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.620
Do you think that the LTT video library is enough of an edge for a new time builder?

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.220
Oh, yeah, you can easily build a PC with the LTT video library

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.980
That's the purpose of how to build a PC the last guide you'll ever need. Okay

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.660
There you go

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:51.660
Okay, there you go, okay, did they just get the RAM installed one of them they're moving a little faster than I'd like right now

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.460
Yeah, this one is high oh no

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.500
Sometimes it's good to rotate things around so you can see from another angle. Hey, that's an advice for both teams. Uh-huh

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.220
Okay, no, it should be fun yeah, okay

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.460
Okay. Oh

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.420
I think you just need to rotate this. I don't have nails you have

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.420
Nails on it

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.340
Yay

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.220
Okay, we can progress, you know in some ways

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.100
I'd actually rather do custom water cooling than an AIO cooler these days because of all the

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.860
Hookups and everything and all the RGB and all that stuff

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:42.220
Can be such a nightmare. I've noticed that you're not using the manual we use it for a little bit

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:48.620
But then we prefer to use at least me. I prefer to use the video because I'm more visual. Yeah, I win

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.540
Good teacher

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:57.340
Oh that you will need that I took it off the table because Linus isn't using that he's got something way more complicated

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.680
Okay, so this is the cooling for the CP. I don't know

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.260
Linus has to you all custom water cooling. So he's got EK parts including a velocity to water coolant block

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:16.200
We're gonna be using the not to NHU 14 s on this side, which is our standard one comes with a 140 mil fan

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.040
How does it make you feel when you watch your boss in a video?

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.680
Weird, I think this is the first

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.040
Yeah, yeah, but it's good I mean you explain really good

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.360
Thank you

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.280
Before I move on to water cooling my GPU

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.720
I want to address a comment that I've seen a lot of times and it's that

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.620
Building computers is easy. It's just Legos for adults

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:50.420
Number one, it's Lego not Legos. The plural is Lego and number two. I just think that's really unfair

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.020
There's nothing wrong with the fact that they're taking their time looking things up going slow

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:02.140
And when you're experienced, you don't think about all that extra overhead that's involved in building a PC. I am

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.900
Functionally done. I've mounted my cooler

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.700
Even though I haven't hooked all the water tubes up to it

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.380
And as soon as I put this GPU in and plug this in I have finished building this PC

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:18.420
That doesn't mean that they're doing anything wrong. I can't help but that's not quite correct. Oh, no, what's not correct?

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.900
You want all of them on the other one?

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:27.220
Okay on number two. Let's make sure everything is in number two. Yes, okay. I

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.020
Think we fix it

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.380
Hey, you should watch this

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.360
Oh

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.020
So we need to rotate it. So if you guys are looking for knock to a cooler instructions

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.420
Uh-huh. I believe you can look at the short

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.080
We did recently mounting one of their coolers from 15 years ago or whatever. It was the same

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.020
It's the exact same mounting mechanism all these years later

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.020
It's been about 43 minutes since we started and both teams are making progress

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.020
Oh

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:10.580
No way, oh, thank you Corsair, it's prepadded dang it Corsair you're making it too easy

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.620
You've already picked the right ones, but they should go on before

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.500
Oh this this one

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.500
And

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.100
There you go and now

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:42.580
Did you guys get the cooler removed yet for this have you have you guys done this part yet? No, what is that? Oh gee

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.400
Okay, so we are good because the cooler will be facing this way so Linus says like

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:01.480
Injected I don't know why it's this funny but hearing them talk about Linus says do this and to do that

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.480
I'm like saying I didn't say nothing

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.560
Okay

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.560
They don't have anything in the case yet

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.760
We need your help

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.200
Two minutes of your hill minutes of my time. Yeah, we're supposed to put something here before put in this. Yes

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:26.860
Okay, no, no, no, sorry that goes directly into it if you look into that there's like it'll screw right in there's yes

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.780
That's the only way it'll go right now. Yeah, and then

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:37.540
We need to screw those. I was given multiple options for a pump reservoir combo

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
This might be a little easier to mount

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.760
Or at least it would have been if anyone had checked to see if this case has any 140 millimeter fan mounts

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.120
Oh don't oh don't just do it

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:56.340
This is cool. EK includes a little sticker. That's a whole guide now, so you can just take this peel it

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.320
Slap it onto wherever you want it and you're good to go

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.520
How are you doing over here, oh, I'm terrible

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.880
I've never built a computer before either. So this is huh? I'm doing good. Thanks for asking

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:22.720
The motherboard and everything's done. Oh my god. Okay. Hopefully the water cooling goes wrong and then we have time for it, you know

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.040
ouch

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.360
Wow

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.080
Maria somehow manages to make even trash talk sound pretty nice, you know, I mean, hopefully

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.040
Hopefully you screw up everything and die. Okay, that looks good

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.120
I think we have to connect this

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.680
Also, do I have fans for my rad? I thought the case came with fans. Ah

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.440
But it's not

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.480
It does not

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.120
We're going on a field trip

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.880
Let's go. Oh, they restocked the snacks

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.440
Yes

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.480
Get some game

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:09.480
Hey, there we go classic LTT edition 120 mils. Oh, yeah

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240
Oh

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.040
David we did the cooler. Yay, you make a progress

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.020
Hey, where's the excitement for me making progress David?

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.640
Nice ah

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.360
Well, that makes it a little easier

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.880
That's a demerit

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:47.040
My camera op knocked out Glenn hit that I didn't hit that Glenn loses points. I'm glad you lose points

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.920
No, I

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.160
Will need a different radiator I'm giving the games master a demerit

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:04.240
For sabotaging my build it fit in the case that I originally tested with but we changed cases because Asus was so generous to send

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.360
this one

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.360
here

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.880
So we need to align that

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.080
Perfect you never have to look far at Linus media group

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.600
To find water cooling crap. Oh, that's an interesting little 120 millimeter

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.840
It's full here, there's something missing. Okay. Yes, then we need Jordan

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.240
Hi Jordan, how are you?

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.880
Oh, we're struggling

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.040
We have the GPU and the power supply here

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.200
Okay

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.960
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea, okay

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.960
I

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.560
Mean to end this video with the longest time somehow. Let me think

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.800
They found screws. Okay, this GPU doesn't fit in this case. Are you kidding me? Oh, it doesn't look like it. I

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.600
Don't need to close my side panel. No, I won't judge you on that. Okay demerits for the game master

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.320
No one needs to close their side panels

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.960
Okay

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.760
Okay, wrap the cables of the power supply we can cheat I

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.840
Mean I guess I could just bend I was planning to just use 90 degree fittings for all of my bends

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.720
It's a bit of a hack, but I think it still counts as hard line, especially when you're time constrained

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.600
CPU this one

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.800
My fans lined up I realized this was just a bare radiator

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.320
It helps it all I'm having a great time, too

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:23.240
Why do you choose to put the fans on top of the radiator fans go on top of the radiator for easier maintenance down the

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.200
Line also, these are orange and I didn't want to see them in there. This is the side of the bars

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.120
Okay

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.120
I'm gonna use the CPU fan header for the pump

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.360
It's far more important that your pump is running than that

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:41.600
Your fans are spinning in that that'll kill your system a lot faster experience that first time a little while ago

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:48.520
They have the names here of the things we have to connect. So CPU should be somewhere around

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:54.120
And then the other one is the PCIe. I

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.480
Don't see them

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.560
Let me see things

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.320
Yes, you have 45 seconds of my help. Okay, where should we connect the PCIe and the CPU?

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:09.560
Connector PCIe is for the graphics card, but this graphics card won't use this. It'll have a specific 16 pin one

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:14.600
I will attempt one freehand bend if this doesn't go flawlessly

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.440
Then I will not attempt another and I'm just gonna go for fittings. Yeah, this thing is not very hot

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.480
Oh David, this is not fitting here

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.640
Can I I'll try it and if I can't do it then

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.720
You're you're not wrong

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.400
Here we go

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.520
Kind of ugly but it'll do right now the problem is this is too thick to fit under here and

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.520
so

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.520
In order to get this inside

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.520
Normally you could kind of like jiggle it in kind of make it work, but I actually don't think we have

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.240
Enough clearance to make that work

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.240
I'm so we might need your help. I might not be good enough for this. What do you need?

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.140
Can you make this fit watch the master?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.880
I thought so. Oh wow

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.920
What do you mean, thank you

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.920
You have to do it

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:26.400
Well, what I'm gonna just hand them the W they're almost done sure this is the last thing once you figure it out

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.560
High five

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.560
Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.720
How's the water cooling going Linus?

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.500
Extra demoralizing doing hard line tubing in a case where the thing isn't even gonna fit together when you're done

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.600
It's just extra airflow because I need so much airflow in my water-cooled computer

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.000
All right, are you gonna keep bending or are you gonna fit it? Uh, you know what the bending was pretty fast

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.920
I think it's gonna be faster for this one, too

00:18:52.920 --> 00:19:00.080
How do you find the screwdriver while you're building the computer for the tiny screws here inside like this toby? Yes, perfect

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.520
It's good. If I'm gonna lose I might as well at least sell a few screwdrivers

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.520
Thanks, ladies

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.520
Yeah, I didn't help

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:17.420
Man, I love hard line tubing. I love my build taking triple the amount of time for all that performance benefit

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.880
You ready for a high-risk maneuver?

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.520
We're gonna fail. Let's fail in an exciting and spectacular manner

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.680
Who needs a guide when you have a need

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.800
Holy I think we got the angle

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.520
How are you finding those little connectors

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:49.040
I can't find a lot of like because they have names on the connectors and we try to match those

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:56.040
Mm-hmm. The only thing that says panel here is this side, but I don't think that matches there

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.520
So like the real question is if we need to use all of them are or not

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.040
I

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:08.600
Probably do but why it's not working five more minutes. No, no, no, no, no

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.200
I'm gonna use a little tiny piece of tubing as a bridge. I

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.920
Think that was the right one. Yeah

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.760
Okay

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:26.160
Fingers crossed who knows if it works or not. We have good chances of winning this

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.120
What do you think? I don't think so

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.880
There

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.080
Okay, there's a red light

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.440
You're missing one very important cable

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.240
Which important cable the one that connects the front power button?

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.840
Here we go freehand 90

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.640
Yeah, oh, that's my ugliest one yet

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:57.800
It's on right? I mean, it's not the fan is not on. I think we're past the two hours, but neither team is finished

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.120
Do we go till someone finishes? Yeah

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.320
All right

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.400
I'm gonna be first. Let's go. I'm just gonna help you at this point

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.240
Thank you. Let's plug in a monitor. See if we're getting display. I'll need a monitor to

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.760
What do you think Glenn? How's it look?

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.080
Huh

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.080
Tastes like candy

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.200
Okay

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.200
Just get it

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.200
Please work

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.800
All right, okay now we're cooking

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:43.880
Let's give the CPU a receipt here. Shall we there's bent pins in my socket at least three what but it worked

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:49.080
I didn't bend them on the way out and I can do a board swap in like four minutes if I have it

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.080
I'll be back. All right, let's go

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.560
Technically, they're not done yet

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.200
Okay, I can still win this I think the best learnable today is that PC building it's a team exercise everybody works together

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.560
Okay, it's working. The GPU is working

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.080
Hey, I posted to LC in Windows they got to figure that out still we do we have a view for that

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.080
I don't know figure it out

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:19.880
I

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:25.280
Still gotta get my GPU back in gotta get my loop filled. They've just got to get out of the BIOS. That's lucky

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.840
It's actually the same BIOS

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.480
We still got this

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.480
We still got this

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.760
Okay, so what did you what did you to do there but walk walk the camera through what you did

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Hey

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.960
Everyone's fortunes turning around this thing's coming together

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.400
Yes, I am putting in cable ties right now if you're not gonna finish on time you got to go for those bonus points

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.880
Okay, one minute left

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.760
Okay presentation right plating

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.840
Ten nine eight seven six

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.520
What was our total time

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:54.220
Just over three hours and 20 minutes, but I'm very impressed and proud of both teams. Oh, thank you

00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:01.840
Do note mr. Judge that my CPU and GPU temperatures are in the top right of the screen Wow

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.760
Okay, that we don't know. No people can do that. I

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.960
Have to say

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.920
The fact that you were able to hardline this computer. This is a good-looking system. Yeah

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.360
So the front looks real good, and that's the most important part, but let's go take a look at the back

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.360
Oh, you don't even have the side panel on

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.600
It's so much cleaner

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.060
Yeah, that was okay. I'm a little bit disappointed by the lack of LTT cable ties

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.520
There's some on the front there's two

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.880
Okay

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.800
Yeah, I mean it's not perfect but for a rush job, this is this is a nice system

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:55.820
Unfortunately due to technical difficulties. I had to step in and help the first impression is it's not quite as clean

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.360
Cable management leaves a little bit to be desired

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:05.880
Though you had cable ties. I brought those specifically read cable management. They need cable one minute in management

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.520
I

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.520
Really had to

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:20.500
It's not as bad as Linus's because there's just not as many cables, but yeah, why is this going over?

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.880
Before we go any further I realized we've never even talked about this GPU I

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.760
Talked about every other component and then they sent over these GPUs because we needed matching GPUs for this

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:42.720
They're 4080s. They're super quiet. They have gigantic coolers on them. They're really fast. I

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:49.220
Actually have something that David missed this computer. Unfortunately is a fire hazard ladies

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.840
Your high voltage PCIe power connector is not in all the way

00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:01.600
However any points I might have taken off for that if I was judging which I'm not I would have given back for using my

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:08.880
Trademarked little tire pretzel in the CPU fan cable trick. I like it. I like it. Good job

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.320
This is really hard. I

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.920
Think you gotta give it to us. I

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.440
Feel really bad doing this, but I think I am gonna award the victory to Linus

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.440
Oh

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.160
This beautiful t-shirt Wow, did you make this shirt?

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.240
You know what I would have given it to them really to be perfectly honest with you

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.980
Yeah, we don't know if I broke the motherboard

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.280
That's true. There's also a lot of water in my computer. You didn't look that closely

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.360
Okay

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.640
We should put it on together, what do you think you guys are doing great? Yeah

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.480
Oh, yeah, yeah now smile

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.960
All right, well this devolved extremely quickly you guys did great GG
