00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.923
- [Mr. Beast] I've
recreated every single set

00:00:01.923 --> 00:00:03.780
from Squid Game in real life,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.380
and whichever one of these 456
people survives the longest,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.480
wins 456 grand.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.860
(contestants cheering)

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.230
The first game we're gonna
play is red light, green light.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.120
They have 30 minutes to cross the red line

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.830
on the other side of the huge room.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.154
So without further ado, green light.

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:20.340
(tense music)

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.173
Red light.

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:24.300
(gun shot)

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.133
Oh, oh.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:25.966
And as you can see,

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.260
every single player has a
device strapped to them,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.510
that when they're eliminated, it pops.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.040
Chris, you wanna have a chance at one?

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.873
- Red light.

00:00:33.793 --> 00:00:34.924
(gun shot)

00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:35.841
Oh, oh, no.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.900
- I know for sure this guy moved.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.280
Green light.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.113
- Red light.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.210
Oh yo, they're dropping.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.190
Okay, now some people are getting out.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.330
- You gotta get a better spot

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.630
for the next red light, right?

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.910
- Mmhmm.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.743
- You're fine.

00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:53.130
- 30 people have gotten out so far.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.480
If they move right now, they're out.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.610
They have to hold this position
until we say green light.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.900
And I can take all the time I want,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.550
'cause we still have 23 minutes left.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.870
- We gotta get a green light going.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.580
This guy's doing a full squat.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.080
- Green light.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.040
Green light.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.873
Oh they all stopped.

00:01:05.873 --> 00:01:07.501
Red light.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.521
(gun shot)
Oh.

00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:10.170
- I called it, I called it.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.010
Oh no.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.779
- Can you push my glasses up?

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:13.612
- Okay.

00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:15.225
- Do it slowly though, be careful.

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:16.058
- Are you good?

00:01:16.058 --> 00:01:16.891
- Yeah, perfect.
- Okay.

00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:17.891
Green light.

00:01:18.877 --> 00:01:19.710
Red light.

00:01:21.237 --> 00:01:22.070
You're still moving.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.880
She was jogging over here.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.470
We're gonna go see who's in the very back.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.180
You are in dead last.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.080
What's going on?

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.820
- I let the others clear the path for me.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.260
- You literally haven't even moved.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.220
- Well, a couple steps.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.950
- We'll see if it pans out, green light.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.693
Yellow, red light.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.980
Oh, that we got her,
the yellow light worked.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.740
- Oh, that was diabolical to
throw a yellow light out there.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.080
- Since 067 was a big part of the show.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.160
I'll let you say green light.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.960
- [All] Green light.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.900
- Red light, yo, it would be
funny if she just got out.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.620
As you can see, over 100
people have been eliminated.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.210
Do the honors, Chandler.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.865
- Green light, red light.

00:01:59.865 --> 00:02:00.698
(gun shot)

00:02:00.698 --> 00:02:02.520
- [Mr. Beast] Oh, that was a loud one.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.530
- There it is, ay.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.363
- Green light.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.340
Red light.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.590
Look how close they
are to the finish line.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.450
It is do or die for most of these people.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.130
Everyone look up at the TV.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.720
You have four minutes and 20 seconds left.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.730
- Yeah, that's the number.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.700
- Green light, red light.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.253
We have our first two finishers over here.

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:25.680
- Lets go!

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.110
- Green light, red light.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.454
- Yes sir, baby.

00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:30.693
Yes sir, baby.

00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:31.526
- [Mr. Beast] All right,

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.480
we have five people across
the finish line now.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.340
- [Chandler] You're all kind of screwed

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.200
if you don't run faster.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.033
- Yep, you're right.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:38.866
- Green light.

00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:40.719
Red light.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.060
- Only two minutes remain.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.110
- Karl makes me way too nervous.

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:49.833
- Green light.

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:51.541
Red light.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.420
- We have under one minute remaining.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.253
Time's ticking, green light.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.499
Red light.

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.298
You have stepped on
the line, you are good.

00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:05.361
You're good.

00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:06.194
You're good.

00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:07.471
- Lets go!

00:03:07.471 --> 00:03:08.583
- Red light.

00:03:10.077 --> 00:03:11.554
(gun shot)

00:03:11.554 --> 00:03:12.690
It worked, it worked, we got em.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.830
You're definitely out.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.933
Dude, I knew that would work, green light.

00:03:19.304 --> 00:03:20.790
Red light.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.010
You're definitely, so
many of you just got out.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.270
- They gotta run faster.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.220
- They've gotta, you gotta sprint.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.591
- Green light.

00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:28.591
Green light.

00:03:29.892 --> 00:03:31.770
I'm not even gonna say red light,

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.853
I'm not saying red light.

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:34.231
Ah, its too late.

00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:35.151
Too late.

00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:37.901
(crowd cheering)

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.322
- Whoa.

00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:42.587
- Holy crap.

00:03:42.587 --> 00:03:46.021
- Congratulations on surviving
red light green light.

00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:48.143
(contestants cheering)

00:03:48.143 --> 00:03:49.590
So if you look at this TV,

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.017
you'll see that only

00:03:51.017 --> 00:03:52.410
(TV twinkling)

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.110
232 of you survived.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.130
If you look above your head,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.610
you'll see the $456,000
you're competing for.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.170
And now let's move on to honeycomb.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.880
In honeycomb, everyone gets a needle,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.789
and a cookie with a different shape on it,

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:05.640
and they have 10 minutes

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.080
to remove the shape from the cookie.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.450
But if they break the
shape, they're eliminated.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.030
All right, so everybody
I'm gonna need you to get

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.330
in the line in front

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.903
of one of these question marks.

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:16.350
(tense music)

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.370
Why did you pick this one?

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.570
- Just like, the middle.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.770
- Basically you don't think it's umbrella.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:20.700
- There's an umbrella?

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.950
- Did you even watch Squid Game?

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.810
- So many of these people
are about to get out.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.673
- Reveal shape number one.

00:04:28.692 --> 00:04:31.519
(contestants cheering)

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:34.507
- Reveal the second symbol.

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:36.608
(contestants cheering)

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:37.980
Look at how hype they're getting.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.271
If I was you, I'd be
getting pretty nervous.

00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:44.274
Reveal it!

00:04:44.274 --> 00:04:47.524
(contestants cheering)

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.583
Chris, go for it.

00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:55.033
- No!

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:56.130
- I know umbrella going home.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.963
That's all I got to say.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.580
- We got the circle. Thank God
we didn't get the umbrella.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.080
(tense music)

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.920
- You look pretty nervous over here.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.450
Even though you got the star,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.470
you're the main character.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.450
so you have plot armor, you're fine.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.713
Start the timer.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.863
The challenge is underway.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.240
You just hear them all scraping.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.033
- I hate my life.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.900
- I was taking it out of the tin,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.976
and it just snapped in half.

00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:31.143
- Lets see it.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.693
- It's working.

00:05:37.616 --> 00:05:40.680
(clock ticking)

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.550
- Take your time.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.720
- You had an umbrella?

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.580
- Yeah.
- Sorry bud.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.830
- Look at this. We have
a successful triangle.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.760
Congratulations.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.593
- Thank you.

00:05:50.427 --> 00:05:51.260
- Oh no.

00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:56.460
- What Jimmy doesn't know
is I brought a lighter,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.210
and I'm gonna drop it for somebody.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.083
- What, what, what?

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.769
- One and a half minutes remaining.

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:08.970
(Yoshi licking sounds)

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.163
- Let's get it, baby.

00:06:10.163 --> 00:06:11.080
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.633
- Oh my gosh, this is the first
perfect umbrella I've seen.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.842
- Oh yeah, easy peasy.

00:06:19.842 --> 00:06:20.695
- Whoo!

00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:22.470
- Six, seven, okay, she passed.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.993
She does have plot armor.

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:26.100
- [Woman] Almost there.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.933
- So close, 30 seconds.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.503
- Oh my God.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.250
- Are you serious?

00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:37.281
- Three, two, one.

00:06:41.324 --> 00:06:42.258
Time is up.

00:06:42.258 --> 00:06:43.355
- You did it?

00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:44.190
You did the umbrella?

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.270
- And just like that,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.250
all these players have been eliminated.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.110
But don't worry because
they're all walking away

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.423
with $2,000 in cash.

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:56.510
142 of you survived honeycomb.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.350
(crowd cheering)

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.120
And if you leave in the next five minutes,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.830
I'll give you $4,000.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.577
Let's weed out some of the weak people.

00:07:03.577 --> 00:07:04.447
$4,000.

00:07:06.907 --> 00:07:07.740
- Thank you.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.214
- I was not expecting this many people.

00:07:10.214 --> 00:07:11.336
There we go, head on out.

00:07:11.336 --> 00:07:12.417
And with that,

00:07:12.417 --> 00:07:14.190
I'm gonna need you all to
split up into groups of 10.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.100
We had them form teams
because next up is tug of war.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.450
- This could determine your chance

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.740
at half a million dollars.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.690
- We needed the strongest
people and the smartest people.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.700
We have intelligence, skill, and brawn.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.990
- We trying to recruit the biggest people,

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.910
so we can get real
strong and pull the rope.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.453
- Sorry, no girls allowed.

00:07:28.453 --> 00:07:30.360
- Oh, no girls allowed, boo, okay.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.770
- I just sent three people off.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.180
We got 10 now let's go.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.800
- Let's go!

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.180
- I should have taken the four grand.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.820
- We now have 12 different
groups of 10 people.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.290
Let's move on to the next game.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.123
And now let's decide who faces who?

00:07:43.123 --> 00:07:44.130
(contestants cheering)

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.570
Okay, we're gonna draw one from here.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.250
Six, we'll just draw this one.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.930
Five, okay.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.253
Follow me to the bridge.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.607
And now the moment
you've been waiting for.

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:56.250
A game of tug of war.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.620
Team six versus team five.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.520
- Team five on three.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.230
One two, three, team five.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.600
- You've fall in the
foam, or your flag crosses

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.790
to the other team's
side. You're eliminated.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.900
Are you guys ready?

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.920
- [All] Yeah!

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.753
- Are you ready?

00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:10.350
- [All] Yeah!

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.387
- All right, three, skip a few, go.

00:08:13.423 --> 00:08:14.614
- Pull!

00:08:14.614 --> 00:08:15.447
- Power!

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:19.616
- Oh, it's going to team five right now.

00:08:19.616 --> 00:08:21.283
Team six is falling.

00:08:24.151 --> 00:08:25.592
Somebody's right at the edge.

00:08:25.592 --> 00:08:27.592
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:35.850
(crowd cheering)

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.530
- Congratulations, team five,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.780
you have all moved on.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.987
Team number two versus team number seven.

00:08:42.987 --> 00:08:44.340
(team cheering)

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.210
They seem happy.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.070
Team seven and two head on out.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.814
- You keep me alive,
we're gonna get the money.

00:08:48.814 --> 00:08:51.481
(team cheering)

00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:53.434
- Give it up, this team's winning.

00:08:53.434 --> 00:08:56.730
- Go, oh, it's already on right side.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.763
Hey, let's check in on 067.

00:08:58.763 --> 00:09:00.120
In the show you won,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.320
so let's see if it works here.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.810
And Karl, we have 067.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:04.650
You should just lose.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.885
- Karl no, give them motivation.

00:09:06.885 --> 00:09:08.913
- Pull!

00:09:11.173 --> 00:09:13.474
- Its over here, it crossed.

00:09:13.474 --> 00:09:16.560
(team cheering)

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.520
Sir, can you come over here?

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.353
Why don't you draw?

00:09:18.353 --> 00:09:19.690
Don't look, grab one from
here, and one from here,

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.510
and then grab one from here.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.764
Team number four versus team number 10.

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:25.980
(team cheering)

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.810
If I was you guys, I'd be terrified,

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.340
'cause they have 456.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.690
He's literally the main character.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.523
- Let's go!

00:09:31.523 --> 00:09:35.089
- Three, two, one, go.

00:09:35.089 --> 00:09:35.922
Oh, they're getting, oh.

00:09:37.768 --> 00:09:40.018
Oh, it's going over to 456.

00:09:46.244 --> 00:09:48.052
They're falling.

00:09:48.052 --> 00:09:49.842
They're dropping

00:09:49.842 --> 00:09:51.425
They all just fell.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.050
Obviously we have no way of rigging it,

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.770
but 456 and 067 both survived tug of war.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.570
Let's draw, oh boy.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.595
Nine versus 11.

00:10:02.595 --> 00:10:04.230
(crowd cheering)

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.480
In this game with team
nine versus team eleven,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.550
they went so hard that this happened.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.394
They are going all out, look at them.

00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:12.871
Oh they're falling.

00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:14.671
Don't let them.

00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:17.625
Oh yes.

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:19.137
Oh, they broke the set.

00:10:19.137 --> 00:10:21.720
They literally broke it.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.310
You guys can move on.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.570
Go ahead and head on now.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.960
Tug of war took us from
120 people down to 60.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.090
And remember, only one of
these people is walking away

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.310
with $456,000.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.540
All right, everybody.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.770
Can we have your attention?

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.450
As you guys know from Squid Games,

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.355
game number four is marbles.

00:10:38.355 --> 00:10:40.020
(contestants cheering)

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.490
- I don't know if I'd be cheering,

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.950
because instead of letting
you pick your partner,

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.810
we're gonna make you partner
with your best friend.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.220
Throughout this entire challenge,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.740
we've been monitoring who
you've been talking to the most,

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.630
and we're gonna make you
partner up with them.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.520
And only one of you can move on.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.733
For example, 067 and 431.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.460
- That's my best friend.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.600
- According to this, you two
are roommates and best friends.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.830
We did our research.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.690
- I have to come home
to the house we live in

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:11.523
at the end of the day,

00:11:11.523 --> 00:11:12.356
gonna be a bit awkward.

00:11:12.356 --> 00:11:13.830
- Wouldn't be able to
do it without you, man.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.850
- We couldn't have done
it without each other.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.020
- I'm glad I'm with you at the end.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.880
- [Mr. Beast] Everybody
gets a bag of 10 marbles,

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.530
and they have to agree
on a game to play it

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.580
against their best friend.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.050
20 marbles lets them move on.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.210
But by winning, they
eliminate their best friend.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.400
Go ahead and start the timer.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.080
You can play whatever game you want,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.430
but you need 20 to leave.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.260
A lot of pairs went with marble games

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.370
that were played in Squid Game.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.273
- Odd.

00:11:34.313 --> 00:11:35.700
- Even.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.015
- Odd or even?

00:11:37.015 --> 00:11:38.316
- Even on that side.

00:11:38.316 --> 00:11:39.149
- What?

00:11:39.149 --> 00:11:40.334
What game are you playing?

00:11:40.334 --> 00:11:41.167
- We don't know.

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:42.532
One marble at a time,
it's gonna take all day.

00:11:42.532 --> 00:11:44.535
- If you keep talking, it might.

00:11:44.535 --> 00:11:45.368
- Okay.

00:11:45.368 --> 00:11:46.830
- [Mr. Beast] And other
groups got creative.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.760
- What is this game?

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.170
- We're throwing it at the bricks, right?

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.360
If you get the middle one
right there, that's one point.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.120
But if you hit the bricks in the behind,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.230
then its three points.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.720
Everything else is no points
until the clock runs down,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.684
Whoever has most points is the winner.

00:11:59.684 --> 00:12:01.020
- All right, well good
luck with your game.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.330
- But one group just
wanted to get it over with.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.130
You're doing even odds for all of it.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.930
Yo, he looks so intense.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.622
- He's got one marble.

00:12:08.622 --> 00:12:09.455
- Are you sure?

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.790
- Oh, he got it, oh my gosh.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.230
Congratulations on winning.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.780
I'll see you in the next round.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.000
- You're good buddy, you're good, okay?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.405
- I'm so sad.

00:12:21.405 --> 00:12:22.238
- Why are you sad?

00:12:22.238 --> 00:12:23.071
It's gonna be okay.

00:12:23.071 --> 00:12:24.990
- We promised each other we were not gonna

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.070
screw each other over.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.780
I didn't even know we
were gonna be this close.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.500
- I'm doing this for my
family, but I'm nervous.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.725
- Best man's gonna win.

00:12:32.725 --> 00:12:34.262
- Best man win man.

00:12:34.262 --> 00:12:35.310
- Best man's gonna win.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.943
- [Mr. Beast] Everybody,
you've got five minutes left.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.030
- Don't look at me.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.006
- They want to put
$465,000 Up to a coin flip.

00:12:49.006 --> 00:12:51.330
- You had to make it sound like that, huh?

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.680
Tails.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.580
- It's tails.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.497
- Yo, oh no.

00:12:58.334 --> 00:12:59.167
- Odd?

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.370
- I'll give you the honor of
eliminating your best friend.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.770
- Oh no, that's even worse.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.038
- Ah.

00:13:07.038 --> 00:13:07.871
- Aww.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.400
- It doesn't hurt.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.233
Before I eliminate you,

00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:13.800
I wanna let the viewers
know that someone random

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.530
that subscribes in the next
seven days is getting $10,000.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.600
So if you haven't already,
hit the subscribe button okay?

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.433
- Can I do it?

00:13:19.433 --> 00:13:21.329
- Go for it. Just hit right there.

00:13:21.329 --> 00:13:22.620
- Oh.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.210
- Don't fall, they're so dramatic.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.350
So if you haven't already subscribe

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.416
and you could win 10 grand.

00:13:26.416 --> 00:13:27.249
What game are we playing?

00:13:27.249 --> 00:13:28.839
- Closest to the wall.

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:30.240
- A minute and 15 seconds remain.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.590
When that hits zero, if you're in here,

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:32.490
you're eliminated.

00:13:34.971 --> 00:13:36.240
- I have one more question to ask.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.815
- What's up, man?

00:13:37.815 --> 00:13:38.978
- You promise to remember me?

00:13:38.978 --> 00:13:39.985
- Oh my gosh.

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:40.818
- What do you mean?

00:13:40.818 --> 00:13:42.570
- You're literally both
about to get eliminated.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.970
Oh, what was that?

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:45.840
- Why'd you do that?

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.490
- You sure?
- Yeah.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.558
- He has been eliminated, thank you, sir.

00:13:49.558 --> 00:13:51.058
- I love you, man.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.640
- The time has hit zero.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.443
Everyone in here is eliminated.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.000
Congratulations on surviving marbles.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.260
At this point in the real show,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.480
there was an all out
brawl to thin the numbers.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.160
So instead we're gonna play Ddakji.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.750
You have to use this blue piece of paper

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.301
to flip that red one on
the ground by throwing it.

00:14:12.301 --> 00:14:14.130
The first 16 of you to
flip your red square

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.600
moves on to glass bridge,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.130
which is personally my favorite game.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.183
Everyone throw.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.210
Oh wow, we didn't even get anyone.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.680
And while they're
fighting for their chance

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.570
in this competition, I wanna tell you guys

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:25.560
about Brawl Stars,

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.550
who helped fund this video,

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.800
which cost over three and
a half million dollars.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.790
Thank you so much.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:30.623
Throw.

00:14:31.838 --> 00:14:32.671
- Yes!

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.820
- Brawl Stars is a mobile
game you can play at home,

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.310
on the go, in this
arena, wherever you want

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.563
against millions of
people across the world.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.413
Oh, we got some.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.170
Congratulations.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.990
It's three minutes of
adrenaline filled mayhem,

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.460
and they have 12 different game modes,

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.990
including their own battle Royale,

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.859
which is kind of similar
to what we're doing here.

00:14:54.859 --> 00:14:55.859
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:14:58.865 --> 00:14:59.698
- Yeah, let's go.

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:01.140
- We have nine winners so far,

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.390
which means only seven places remain.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.993
You said you played Brawl Stars?

00:15:04.993 --> 00:15:05.826
- We both do.

00:15:05.826 --> 00:15:06.659
- Oh, you both play Brawl Stars?

00:15:06.659 --> 00:15:07.492
What are your thoughts on Brawl Stars?

00:15:07.492 --> 00:15:08.325
- That it's pretty fun.

00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:11.211
It's a mobile game, you can
download it on Android or Apple.

00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:13.740
- I didn't tell him to say this.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.573
- Lets go!

00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:16.740
- Yeah!

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.950
- Yo, the main characters survived.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.040
As you can see,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.290
you see the Brawl Stars logo, he did it.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.870
They have over 50 different
characters you can play as,

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.110
from a vintage driven robot
to a cactus named spike,

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.580
that kind of looks like Nolan.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.413
- Hey.

00:15:30.413 --> 00:15:32.040
- And like all our
contestants here are leaving

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.840
with $2,000 for free today.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.267
Every single person that plays Brawl Stars

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:36.930
within the next seven days,

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.940
I will personally be
giving you a free prize.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.650
So if you haven't already, go download it.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.210
If you yell "Thank you, Brawl Stars."

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.711
Before you throw, I hear you'll flip it.

00:15:44.711 --> 00:15:46.555
- [Contestants] Thank you Brawl Stars!

00:15:46.555 --> 00:15:47.388
- Oh, it worked for him.

00:15:47.388 --> 00:15:48.540
- Oh my God, it's true.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.830
- Thank you, Brawl Stars.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.870
- And for the 14 of you
that didn't flip it,

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.610
I'm gonna have to eliminate you.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.710
Oh, that was so in sync, oh my gosh.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:57.990
Now can all of you winners turn around.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.110
Thank you, and now you
can turn around again.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.780
We just filled the room with
16 different mannequins,

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.620
and here's the thing.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.150
They're actually in a random order.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.800
And the numbers on them are in Korean.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.180
And the number they get here

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.690
is what order they have
to cross in glass bridge.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.153
In a timely and orderly
fashion. You can all go.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.120
First come, first serve.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.953
What'd you get?

00:16:18.953 --> 00:16:20.040
Oh, she got one.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.150
Oh.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.193
- 15, okay.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:24.960
- All right, if you wanna
just go ahead and leave now.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.023
Everyone has a vest with numbers,
let's go to glass bridge.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.860
We are now at the glass bridge set,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.960
and look at how insane this thing looks.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.950
It is amazing.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.570
And bring out the contestants.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.633
I can't wait to see the
look on their faces.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:40.423
- [Contestant] Oh, what?

00:16:40.423 --> 00:16:41.256
Oh my God.

00:16:41.256 --> 00:16:44.428
- Players, welcome to glass bridge.

00:16:44.428 --> 00:16:45.840
(contestants cheering)

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.910
There is two platforms you can jump on.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.100
One will drop you, and one will hold you.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.600
Start the timer.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.680
Begin the challenge.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.513
- Okay.

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:54.346
- Let's go, girl.

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:55.179
- I'm sticking with the
guys I'm sticking with.

00:16:55.179 --> 00:16:56.400
I'm sticking, I'm sticking.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.880
- All right, she survived the first jump.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.360
Okay, they are one for one so far.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.193
- Go right?

00:17:04.193 --> 00:17:05.026
- I'm always right.

00:17:05.026 --> 00:17:05.859
- Okay.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.080
- I don't know if I'd listen to Chris.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.460
- Chris, this is on you.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.933
- Hey, victory.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.280
- We had our first loss.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.350
If you're wondering where
she just fell, don't worry,

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.600
there's a giant foam pit
down there, she's fine.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.490
Well now, now you know.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.959
Now you know left.

00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:23.370
- Come on, 13 Minutes guys.

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:25.230
- We now have three
people on the platform.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.220
Only one out so far.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.600
- I'm not moving.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.420
I want somebody past eight
to take the next step.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.253
- Past eight?

00:17:31.253 --> 00:17:32.220
All right, I love that, yo.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.800
- Hey. Three minutes has gone by.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.180
- Is anybody willing to go?

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.586
Clock's ticking.

00:17:37.586 --> 00:17:40.298
- [Mr. Beast] All right, let's see it.

00:17:40.298 --> 00:17:42.330
(tense music)

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.535
- Come on, man.

00:17:43.535 --> 00:17:44.423
You got this.
- Come on, Ted.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.720
- Yes.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.553
- Now go two.

00:17:48.553 --> 00:17:49.386
Now you go.

00:17:49.386 --> 00:17:51.183
- Come on two, you got this.

00:17:51.183 --> 00:17:52.016
- I'll take the next one.

00:17:52.016 --> 00:17:54.090
- All right, bro.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.079
- Come on four, five, let's go.

00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:56.912
- Let's go.

00:17:56.912 --> 00:17:57.745
- Lets go, two.

00:17:57.745 --> 00:17:58.800
Let's go, two.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.530
Oh, you already knew that one.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.363
- Oh, oh.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.330
- Oh.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.500
- You see how many I've gotten?

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.400
Take the next one.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.480
- How many did you guess right?

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.380
- Three.
- Three?

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.213
- Yeah.
- Wow.

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:10.410
Yeah, honestly it's time
someone else steps up.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.330
- Hey every second
somebody doesn't step up,

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:13.500
that's less time you got.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.597
- Hey, if no one crosses,
I just keep the money.

00:18:15.597 --> 00:18:17.147
- All right, three went for it.

00:18:19.345 --> 00:18:20.580
- Three just got eliminated.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.972
All right, two, he took the L for you.

00:18:22.972 --> 00:18:23.805
- Adio time two.

00:18:23.805 --> 00:18:25.890
- Hey honestly, hey two,
if you're three for three,

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.820
you might as well keep going.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.020
Clearly, you're lucky.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.300
- Oh my God, all right.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.980
- [Mr. Beast] No pushing,
obviously, please.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:32.813
- Come on.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.280
- Two bit the bullet.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.330
- Two's gone.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.590
- Under eight minutes.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.420
You've still got a ton of ground to cover.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.353
- Yeah, he's good.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.320
- I don't understand why number 10 went

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.153
in front of everyone.

00:18:44.153 --> 00:18:45.320
That was dumb.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.860
- Come on buddy.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.600
- Yo did 10 make it again?

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.340
- All right, it looks like
number four is gonna go.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.800
- Six minutes remaining.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.350
- I'm doing this for the girls.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.733
- Let's salute all the fallen people.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.340
All right, continue.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.360
Under five minutes left.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.193
Tons of jumps.

00:19:04.193 --> 00:19:05.580
This is gonna get intense.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.630
- Oh, that was crazy.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.320
- No ten's gone, no.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.870
- [Mr. Beast] Another one gone.

00:19:13.994 --> 00:19:15.600
- All right, don't move bud, don't move.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.530
- I'm not moving.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.822
- Your odds don't look
back there right now.

00:19:18.822 --> 00:19:19.655
- Nah, I'm not moving.

00:19:19.655 --> 00:19:20.488
I'm not moving.

00:19:20.488 --> 00:19:21.510
- All right, just like
we thought would happen,

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.500
They're refusing to move.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.520
Let's see who budges.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.893
- I'm pretty good where I am.

00:19:25.796 --> 00:19:26.629
- Lets go.

00:19:26.629 --> 00:19:28.474
- You got it.

00:19:28.474 --> 00:19:29.550
- Oh, he got it.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.373
- All right, no, not a chance, come on.

00:19:32.375 --> 00:19:33.420
- When are y'all big
numbers taking a chance?

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.310
- Under three minutes
with four jumps left.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.240
- Somebody's gonna have to do it.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.710
Y'all are in a real bad spot.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.543
I'm not moving.

00:19:38.543 --> 00:19:40.380
- What are y'all big numbers
taking a leap of faith?

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.430
- Hey, how are you doing back there, 15?

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.140
- Whatever, man, we could all lose.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.730
- You guys better hurry up.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.250
- They have two minutes,
why are they not rushing?

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.900
- If you go, I'll take the next one.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.880
- All right.
- Come on.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.713
- You jumping?

00:19:51.713 --> 00:19:52.546
- Y'all really got me scared,

00:19:52.546 --> 00:19:53.430
but hold up bro.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.577
This is a real life decision.

00:19:55.577 --> 00:19:57.480
- 90 seconds, one and a half minutes.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.680
- Come on now, come on, come on, come on.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.513
- Six.

00:19:59.513 --> 00:20:02.093
- Jump, jump, jump.

00:20:04.573 --> 00:20:05.406
Oh, you passed.

00:20:05.406 --> 00:20:07.376
- I ain't moving, I am not moving.

00:20:07.376 --> 00:20:09.780
Y'all, there's a God
telling me I'm not moving.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.920
- One minute remaining.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.483
Three jumps, one minute.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.630
Hey, you guys in the back,

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.640
if you're not here when
it hits zero, you're gone.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.020
- I took my leap of faith,

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.850
now I'm gonna stay right here and be cozy.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.080
- Hurry, go.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:22.913
- Y'all go.

00:20:22.913 --> 00:20:24.360
- [Mr. Beast] It's just three.

00:20:26.863 --> 00:20:30.060
(All clamoring)

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.380
- Take a leap of faith, come on, come on.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.460
- You're up.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.600
- I can't jump, they're in my way.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.433
They're in my way.

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:36.595
- They're all crowded on that one.

00:20:36.595 --> 00:20:38.342
- Hey, 30 seconds.

00:20:38.342 --> 00:20:39.847
- Go, go.

00:20:39.847 --> 00:20:42.521
- Go, take a leap of faith.

00:20:42.521 --> 00:20:44.247
Go, go, go.

00:20:44.247 --> 00:20:45.745
- One more jump.

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:47.370
20 seconds.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:48.203
One more jump.

00:20:48.203 --> 00:20:49.036
- I already jumped,

00:20:49.036 --> 00:20:50.837
I'm not jumping I'm not jumping.

00:20:50.837 --> 00:20:53.337
- 10, nine, eight, seven, six.

00:20:55.417 --> 00:21:00.417
- Someone go.

00:21:01.847 --> 00:21:03.600
- Let me go watch the replay real quick.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.670
I'm gonna play the footage
and slowmo for the viewers.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:06.720
As you can see,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.540
the timer is on zero and
there were four people

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.630
still clearly on the platforms
when the timer hit zero.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:16.017
The four people were
16, eight, 13, and five.

00:21:16.017 --> 00:21:18.480
All right, so the four
losers, can you jump off?

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.840
Just jump, you're eliminated,
you're eliminated.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.520
You're eliminated, get outta here.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.390
Thank you for coming out.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.660
And all of you are moving
onto the final game.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.590
They're competing for $456,000, let's go.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.370
Congratulations on
making it to the top six.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.440
To celebrate, we made
you all steak dinners.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.870
Now, unlike the show,
this isn't a real knife,

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:40.830
this is plastic.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.480
But, you do have steak.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.860
Everyone make sure you eat up,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.230
so you have plenty of
energy for this final game.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.060
- I'm thinking about winning
all of that money right now.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.120
I'm probably give most of
it to my family, friends.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.290
- That money's coming home with me,

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.090
giving $100K straight to my mama.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.950
- I'm feeling great, it's
just blessed to be here.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.060
- I'm gonna pull through,

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.910
I'm definitely donating
about 10,000 to TEAMSEAS,

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.160
which all of you should
if you have the means.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.540
- I won't fold under no pressure.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.280
I'm not worried about none of these five.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.260
Ain't nobody got nothing
on me, so I'm good.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.480
- You wanna just go settle
this with the final game?

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.430
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, let's do it.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.263
- Let's do it.

00:22:12.263 --> 00:22:14.880
- Welcome to the final
game of Beast Games.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.650
So I think you guys can piece together

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.073
what we're about to play.

00:22:18.073 --> 00:22:19.307
- Musical chairs.

00:22:19.307 --> 00:22:20.280
- Musical chairs, yeah.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.750
Let's test my hypothesis,

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.510
raise your hand if you know
how to play Squid Game.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.090
Exactly, that's why we're
doing musical chairs instead,

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:28.950
because we're not Korean, start circling.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.600
Start the music.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.540
Karl, you can stop it whenever you want.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.010
Karl do not look.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.060
Chris, don't look.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.030
Karl isn't looking so we can't be biased.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.703
All right, let's see what happens.

00:22:44.394 --> 00:22:45.570
Oh, oh he got it.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.875
- I got more, man.

00:22:46.875 --> 00:22:47.880
I'm pretty sure.
- He's way more.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.742
I'm sorry about that.

00:22:49.742 --> 00:22:50.575
Oh no.

00:22:51.563 --> 00:22:52.658
- Sorry bro.

00:22:52.658 --> 00:22:54.000
- Bring the coffin over here.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.440
Hop on in the coffin.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.040
He has officially been
eliminated, and five remain.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.513
This chair is now gone.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.435
Karl, start the music.

00:23:03.435 --> 00:23:05.133
(ominous music)
Okay.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.413
You have full...

00:23:07.413 --> 00:23:09.840
Oh, hold on, hold on.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.160
No more moving, come over here.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.170
No why'd you get up?

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.080
- Nah, he had it.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.913
He had it.

00:23:15.913 --> 00:23:17.250
- At least he is honest.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:18.210
Oh my gosh.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.193
And while they're coffining
him up, play the music.

00:23:21.193 --> 00:23:22.380
(ominous music)
Okay.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.067
The music has begin.

00:23:24.067 --> 00:23:27.390
$456,000 on the line.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.433
- It's about to happen at any second.

00:23:30.629 --> 00:23:31.889
- Oh man, oh, you sat.

00:23:31.889 --> 00:23:32.953
Oh no.

00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:34.020
- He sat early, he sat early.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.940
- Karl did not stop the music.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.980
Bring out the coffin, I'm
gonna have to pop you.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.140
Man, that's such a sad way to go out.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.360
- It was a great journey, I loved it.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.480
It was so fun.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.830
- Hop on in the coffin.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.130
All right. Now you can't
say this is scripted.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.832
Good luck.

00:23:48.832 --> 00:23:49.860
(ominous music)
Okay.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.360
The music has started.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.280
Three people, two chairs.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.393
One must go.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.813
Keep it moving now.

00:23:56.813 --> 00:23:58.260
You gotta keep moving.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.160
Gotta keep moving.

00:24:01.578 --> 00:24:02.411
Oh no.

00:24:03.397 --> 00:24:04.897
- Yes!

00:24:04.897 --> 00:24:05.730
- They were against me.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.053
They were against me bruh.
- Oh my God.

00:24:07.053 --> 00:24:08.430
- They plotted on me.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.110
- You have been eliminated.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.160
Open up the coffin.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.660
Thank you for coming out, man.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.130
- No problem.
- I loved your energy.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:17.280
at the start of this
video, we had 456 people.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.420
Now we're down to these two.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.770
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.653
- Okay, I'm gonna take
this chair right here.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.160
You guys gotta keep
moving the entire time.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.600
No stopping and hovering.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.350
This will determine which
one of you wins 456 grand,

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.514
Karl, kick the music on.

00:24:33.514 --> 00:24:34.860
(ominous music)
Hey, let it play

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.883
a little bit, Karl.

00:24:36.856 --> 00:24:38.340
Lets let them soak in it.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.570
Karl's not looking at them.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.940
He has no idea where
they are on the chair.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.290
- Somebody's gonna get $456,000
because you pause the music.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:47.790
- Oh boy.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.460
Oh, this is, oh the intensity.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.960
When will he pause it?

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.210
When's he gonna pause it?

00:24:58.746 --> 00:25:01.246
- Yo, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:25:05.943 --> 00:25:07.140
Oh, my God!

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.280
- If it makes you feel better,

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.284
I'm gonna give you $10,000
for coming in second place.

00:25:11.284 --> 00:25:12.293
- Oh, you're kidding me.
- No.

00:25:12.293 --> 00:25:17.293

00:25:17.497 --> 00:25:20.070
