00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
(energetic electronic music)

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.860
- All right, so this is a crypto phone.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.487
And I know what you're thinking,

00:00:09.487 --> 00:00:11.190
"What the hell is a crypto phone,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.950
and why would anyone want that?"

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.630
And that's exactly what I was thinking

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.040
when this first crossed my radar.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.500
So this is an upper,
mid-range Android phone,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.570
with crazy material choices,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.400
from a brand you've never heard of,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.120
with some specific
crypto features built in,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.760
that launched at a thousand dollars.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.960
Now, I know I have been notably skeptical

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.820
on crypto and Web3 and
blockchain and the Metaverse

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.320
and all that sort of stuff
over the past couple years,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.840
so you may consider me biased,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.840
but I still think if you took
the crypto out of this phone,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.360
it would at least have potential.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.350
I'm serious.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.183
Let me explain.

00:00:53.183 --> 00:00:55.260
So the story of this phone
actually starts all the way back

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.790
with the Essential Phone.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.930
So I don't know how many y'all remember

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.060
the Essential Phone back in 2017,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.190
but that was a really interesting

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.040
and exciting new development
in the smartphone world.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.140
We don't get that many
genuinely promising,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.380
new phone companies coming
along and doing good things,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.660
but that's exactly what
this Andy Rubin startup

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.330
was promising when they came
out with their first phone.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.600
It was just this refreshing
sort of minimal design.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.640
There were no protruding camera bumps,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.650
no big logos or branding.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.350
They were one of the first
to do this camera notch here,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.330
at the top of the screen,
with the thin bezels,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.370
and they were one of the only ones

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.800
using these super premium materials,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.640
the titanium rails and
polished ceramic on the back,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.230
and then it just had some pins on the back

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.530
with some magnets for attaching
some modular accessories,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.170
just some genuinely
interesting, really cool ideas

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.020
on top of some super clean software.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.770
Now, unfortunately, this
experiment didn't really catch on.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.130
You know, this unfortunate
combination of high price,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.610
mediocre cameras, not that
strong of a feature set

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.870
for regular people to care,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.790
launching as a Sprint exclusive,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.900
all of this led to extremely low sales.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.180
And then the company would
go on to dynamite itself

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.820
after a bunch of info
about Andy Rubin comes out.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.060
And so we would not get
to see a second try,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.290
an Essential Phone 2.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.020
Now, it sucks to see a promising company

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.200
with a ton of talent
just disappear like that,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.820
but something that happens a lot,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.550
a lot of times when these
businesses dissolve,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.740
is the teams that worked on stuff

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.770
sometimes will pop up somewhere else,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.850
and work on something else.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.710
And so sure enough, in 2020,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.350
a bunch of the engineers from
the original Essential team

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.730
got back together to form
a new company, called OSOM,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.300
and they would announce their
first project, the OSOM OV1,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.150
basically the spiritual
successor to the Essential Phone,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.630
and you can see a lot of
similarities and continuity

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.830
in this announcement.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.930
They talked about these
crazy materials again,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.880
this titanium and polished ceramic,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.830
and the rectangular design,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.260
but they also, then tried to
correct a bunch of the things

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.030
that doomed the original Essential Phone.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.820
It is noticeably bigger,
and with a bigger screen,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.200
bigger battery, et cetera.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.410
But shocker, they didn't
really get enough interest

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.480
in this brand new startup phone

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.910
to be able to bring this
whole idea back to life.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.220
It's the classic enthusiast phone problem

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.300
where like it's a cool idea,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.010
and some people really, really want it,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.360
but there's not enough hype

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.460
to be able to make the whole thing happen.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.790
That is until Solana came along.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.840
So Solana is a Web3 company
looking for new projects

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.627
and OSOM is this hardware team

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:34.020
looking for some backing
to make this phone happen.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.230
So Solana would bring the
cash and bring their backing.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.640
OSOM would bring their hardware talent

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.340
and they'd partnered
together to turn the OV1

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.960
into this rebranded
Solana Saga, crypto phone.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.023
And it would be a thousand dollars.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.950
And that's this phone right here.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.240
So all right, where do we start?

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.770
There's basically three things
that make this a crypto phone

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.830
instead of just another
regular Android phone.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.030
So the Solana Mobile Stack,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.240
the Seed Vault and the Dapp store

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.950
so okay, outside of those things,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.530
this OV1 or the Solana phone

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.720
is actually a very average Android phone.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.690
Like specs wise, it's a
Snapdragon 8+, gen one,

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.700
so that would be last
year's flagship chip,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.280
but then 12 gigs of RAM and
half a terabyte of storage,

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.710
although it's unclear
if it's fast UFS 3.1,

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.710
but it's a nice big 6.67 inch
flat 1080p 120 hertz display,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.150
at the front, that gets decently bright,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.960
but it is not LTPO, it's
just a fixed refresh rate,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.840
and then it's powered by a
4,100 milliamp hour battery

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.460
with wireless charging.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.090
Not great for the size of
this screen, but not tiny.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.550
And then it's IP 68
water and dust resistant

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.670
with a micro SD card slot
for storage expansion.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.030
But then a pair of really
mediocre cameras on the back.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.850
It's got the same 50
megapixel main camera sensor

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.840
that's in the ROG Phone 7
and the Oppo Find X5 pro,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.310
but with worse software,

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.370
and that's paired with a 12
megapixel ultra-wide camera,

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.860
both of which can pretty much only produce

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.910
in perfect lighting,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.190
after which things fall apart very quickly

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.650
with a lack of detail, excessive noise,

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.750
just no really impressive strengths,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.210
just a really very heavily mixed bag here.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.670
But there are two things about this phone

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.040
that actually I'm very impressed by,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.110
that I really like, okay?

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.690
Number one is the materials again,

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.640
just this world class build quality,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.280
because like I said, it's
basically the same team,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.020
the awesome OV1 team,

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.390
that came from the
original Essential Phone.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.950
And so they have this affinity

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.390
for super high quality materials.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.540
So we're talking matte
stainless steel frame

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.620
with colored titanium buttons
and a full ceramic back,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.330
which yes, picks up
fingerprints everywhere,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.410
other than the fingerprint reader,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.270
but dude, this phone is a tank.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.400
This phone is also very heavy.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.380
It weighs like 250 grams,

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.720
which is more than an iPhone 14 Pro Max.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.120
It's got these nice squared
off sides, that I really like.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.120
There's absolutely no squeaking,
creaking, flexing at all.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.820
It's just this hilariously,
well-made packaging

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.350
of these average specs.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.090
But then two, the other
thing I really like,

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.430
aside from the crypto
stuff, the software itself,

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.270
once you get into it, is
actually extremely clean,

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.830
very clean, like stock Android.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.270
So it is Android 13,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.000
and who knows when it'll
get Android 14 if at all,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.920
but you can dig through everything

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.730
and it is very quick and
responsive and clean everywhere.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.770
It's the stock Android quick settings,

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.950
the stock Android wallpaper
and customization screens,

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.360
all these stock Google apps,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.060
the clock, the calendar,
Chrome, everything.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.060
Now, does any of this justify
a thousand dollar price tag?

00:06:41.253 --> 00:06:42.270
(exhales) Okay, well, let's see,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.880
ot's got last year's flagship spec,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.550
kind of weak cameras, weak battery,

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.800
not that amazing of a screen,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.230
but it's stock Android and good build,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.940
not really worth a thousand bucks, right?

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.010
So that's why literally less
than a year after it came out,

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.270
the price plummeted
from a thousand to $600.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.880
So now the real question is would you pay,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.680
would anybody pay $600 for
a barely above average,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.090
well-built, Android phone

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.153
that happens to have some
crypto features built in?

00:07:13.623 --> 00:07:16.530
(sighs) I guess this is the
part where I have to go over

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.750
all of the crypto and web3 features.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.610
So all right, like I mentioned earlier,

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.730
there's three things that
make this a crypto phone.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.800
So the Solana Mobile Stack is an SDK

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.830
for apps to connect to
this Solana blockchain,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.900
which I mean, it's cool
that it's built in,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.480
but the obvious downside
being this does not work

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.310
with any other blockchain.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.300
So no Bitcoin, no Litecoin, no Ethereum,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.870
this is just focused on
the Solana blockchain.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.900
Then the seed vault is
basically dedicated storage

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.710
of a 24 phrase seed, stored
in a secure environment,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.870
where the Android OS cannot see them,

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.610
so that would let you unlock your wallet,

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.480
and then the last feature

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.730
is something I've been
calling a D app store,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.060
which is literally a second
app store on this device

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.320
that's specifically for crypto
apps, crypto focused stuff.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.690
So Phantom Wallet is on here,

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.940
OKX, a crypto exchange is on here,

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.220
Brave Browser, things like that.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.660
There's an app called Minty Fresh

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.390
that lets you turn photos
from your camera roll

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.630
into NFTs in a few
seconds and a few clicks,

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.460
if you're into that I guess.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.840
But those are the only three things

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.540
that really make this a crypto phone,

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.280
and one of 'em, the Dapp store,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.420
is not really even that special

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.250
because it is coming to other phones

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.560
and you'll be able to get
it on a non crypto phone.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.880
So there's that too.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.810
Now, the other stuff,

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.430
I think you can actually make an argument.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.400
is really, really cool to
have built into the phone

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.200
and actually secure like that.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.230
And if you are in the Solana ecosystem,

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.960
this is the only place
you can get that stuff.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.008
But man, I feel like
that's about the most niche

00:08:50.008 --> 00:08:51.420
(laughs) feature possible.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.220
Like remember we were just
talking about the Zenfone 10,

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.670
how I love that phone,
it's a super great phone.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.020
It's just a shame it won't sell

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.980
because not as many
people like small phones.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.990
Do you think the number of people,

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.670
who are in the Solana ecosystem
and want to buy a phone

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.283
that has some of those features built in,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.480
is greater than or less
than the number of people

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.920
who want a small phone?

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.753
Basically,

00:09:17.753 --> 00:09:19.920
the number one coolest thing
to come outta this project,

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.530
to me, is exposing me to
this thing right here,

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.620
which is the cable that comes
in the box for this phone.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.290
This is a braided USBC, a USBC cable,

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.700
but not just any cable.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.910
At the end here is a hard
switch that blocks all data

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.770
and only lets power through,

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.540
just making it a charging cable,

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.920
and that's actually pretty sick,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.540
highly effective for preventing

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.280
something called juice jacking attacks

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.040
where if you plug into, like
a public outlet somewhere,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.810
but that outlet is malicious

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.090
and is gonna try to upload
malware to your device

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.160
or download photos or something,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.340
this cable will not let that
happen, just blocks all data.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.410
So if you're plugging
into an extremely rare,

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.270
public USBC port, (laughs)

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.790
this is actually a great tool to have,

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.050
but it's also not that special

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.180
and it's available on
Amazon for like 30 bucks,

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.530
so I'll also link that below.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.320
So at this point, I don't
even have to really tell you,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.800
but the crypto phone is basically

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.750
a pretty standard Android phone
with a couple kind of cool,

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.930
but extremely niche crypto features

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.470
for one specific crypto stack,

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.110
one that happens to also
be tanking pretty hard

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.000
and has been tanking for months.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.460
And I also don't even
really have to tell you that

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.080
there's basically no reason

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.290
for 99.99% of people to buy this.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.720
Even if you were to try to buy this phone,

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.090
just for a nice clean stock Android phone,

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.880
and just totally ignore
all the crypto features,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.920
you can get a lot more phone for 600 bucks

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.720
for the same price you could get a Pixel 7

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.120
or probably Pixel 8, by
the time it comes out.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.050
You could get a refurbished Galaxy S 23.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.450
You could get any number of 1+ phones.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.940
I just don't think this is
anywhere near the top of the list

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.773
for 600 bucks.

00:10:57.773 --> 00:11:00.090
And really that's the shame of it.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:04.770
Being a brand new phone
company is really hard

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.200
unless your name is Carl Pay, apparently.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.110
And so I wish there was a world where

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:15.110
the OSOM OV1 could just
exist and could thrive,

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.370
and a small niche
community, could love it,

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.203
but now instead,

00:11:18.203 --> 00:11:23.150
this becomes the perfect
embodiment of crypto in 2023.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.027
At best, ahead of its time,

00:11:28.027 --> 00:11:31.500
but at worst, completely useless

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.660
to most everyday people

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.930
and gives whatever else
is going to follow it

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.553
an even harder uphill battle.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.030
Thanks for watching.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.680
Catch you on the next one.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.912
Peace.

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:48.568
