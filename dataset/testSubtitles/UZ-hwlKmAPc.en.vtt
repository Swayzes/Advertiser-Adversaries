00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.270
40 Super? More like 4080, wow, Super Paint Job.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.240
In 4K gaming, we found next to no difference

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.042
across our entire suite of games

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.510
between our two top-end cards.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.415
In fact, our Super card performed a bit worse in Cyberpunk

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.918
compared to our non-Super, despite having more cores

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.454
and higher on-paper clock speeds.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:25.258
Now, that doesn't mean the Super is a worse card overall.

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:27.093
We've just released a video demonstrating

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.829
that modern processors can have measurable difference

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.398
from one to the next.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.234
All it means is power limits are a bit,

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:37.937
and this whole launch shenanigans could have been an email.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.572
So rather than waste your time

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.842
trickling out LTT review videos every couple of weeks

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:45.845
with, ooh, one more line on the graph,

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.315
we combined everything into one Super video.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.285
Between the price cuts and the new cards though,

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:56.423
the GPU market has officially been shaken up a lot here.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.859
$1 for frame, the 4080 Super presents virtually

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.864
the same value as the beloved 3080 at its original MSRP.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.634
And while the other Super refresh cards

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.202
don't get lower prices,

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.704
they're at least more Winter Soldier Super

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.474
than Nick Fury Super.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:18.478
Finally, the 4070 gets a price cut down to $550,

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.948
which makes it actually still kind of a bad value.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.585
We're not gonna spend too much time on 1080p gaming

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.721
because even the weakest card in this kind of price tier

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.958
delivers an excellent 1080p ultra experience.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.927
It is impressive to see the 3080

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.262
sinking so low on our charts though.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.732
And the 4070 Super is really impressive,

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.734
beating out even the 3090,

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.369
despite retailing for less

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.072
than the historically low pricing on that card.

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.407
If you're an eSports player,

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:50.877
the good news is any card on this chart will do you well.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.413
But the bad news is the word Super

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.014
can mean basically anything

00:01:55.014 --> 00:02:00.019
from a sizable performance increase to meh.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:04.257
So what exactly did they change with these cards?

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:07.060
Let's go through it after this message from our sponsor.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.830
Build Redux, psst, hey, do you like gaming?

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.199
The folks over at Build Redux do as well.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.734
And their mission is to help you build

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:16.603
the gaming rig of your dreams.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:19.038
Pick your parts and let them take care of the rest.

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:21.741
Check out Build Redux at the link below to learn more.

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:25.111
The 4070 Super uses the same 8104 silicon

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:28.615
that's found on its non-Super and Ti cousins.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:29.883
Man, these names.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:33.853
But it comes with 20% increases in its functional units,

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:37.323
or FUs for short, just about across the board.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:40.260
And it got an especially big bump in level two cache.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.796
It, however, got no increase to its memory interface width

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:46.332
or its 12 gigabytes of VRAM,

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.735
a move that seems entirely designed to ensure

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:52.539
that this otherwise actually pretty solid value card

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.441
won't last for the rest of this generation of console games,

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.677
many of which already perform best

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:00.413
with 16 gigs of VRAM or more.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:01.714
So if that's a concern,

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:05.018
you'll have to look to the 4070 Ti Super.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:09.455
It now shares the same 8103 silicon as the 4080 family,

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:10.590
but it's clear that this move

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.792
is less about providing more value

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:15.862
and more about NVIDIA offloading some 8103 chips

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.497
that weren't up to snuff.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.399
As for the 4080 Super,

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.334
the modest increase in FUs

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:25.004
seems to offer a small benefit sometimes,

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.239
but other times it's clear

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.274
that NVIDIA's power limit for this card

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:32.679
is doing exactly what it's intended to do, limit its power.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.881
You'll see what I mean at 1440p.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:38.284
The 4070 Ti Super is another major disappointment here.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.119
Despite the shift to the bigger die,

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.056
we don't really see a major increase in performance,

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:46.059
at least not like we saw on the 4070 Super.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.695
And even at its new lower price,

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:51.297
the 4080 Super doesn't seem to offer

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:55.335
a great value proposition over AMD's 7900 XT

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:58.037
or NVIDIA's own 4070 Ti Super,

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:02.008
which now retail for 750 and 800 US dollars respectively.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:05.078
It offers only a single digit performance uplift

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.615
for what are in both cases, double digit price bumps.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.216
A couple of bright spots for NVIDIA though

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:12.552
are they took the lead in F123,

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:15.555
a game series that has heavily favored AMD in the past,

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:18.691
and the 4070 Super just kind of in general,

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:21.794
that is an offer that is kind of hard to refuse,

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:25.398
at least in the context of NVIDIA's other 40 series cards.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:26.599
Say it with me guys,

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.737
this is the card NVIDIA should have released a year ago.

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:32.438
Looking at games like Cyberpunk,

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:35.141
the step up from the non-Super is pretty darn big.

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:39.479
And yeah, it's $100 more than the 7800 XT,

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.250
but the 4070 Super outperforms it consistently by about 5%

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.720
and is compatible with NVIDIA's fancy pants AI features,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.057
like their new automatic SDR to HDR video playback

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.960
tomfoolery and DLSS with frame gen.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.361
We're gonna get to frame gen in a bit,

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:58.431
but first let's move on to 4K raster gaming.

00:04:58.431 --> 00:04:59.966
In Dota 2 at 4K,

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.335
every single Super GPU will be able to produce

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.871
as many frames as you can possibly output

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:07.040
with DisplayPort 1.4a.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.976
AMD's DP2 Cloud GPUs on the other hand,

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.778
may end up being the go-to

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:14.480
for high refresh rate 4K e-athletes,

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.382
even if it comes at the cost of some performance

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:17.617
in other games.

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:21.254
The 4080 Super pulls pretty far ahead of the 7900 XT

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:23.623
and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Atomic Heart.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.458
As for the 4070 Ti Super,

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:28.027
it has fully caught up to the 7900 XT

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:32.832
and extends its lead over the 4070 Super to about 20%.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.034
A point where it's $800 price tag

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:37.737
could almost be justifiable.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:42.075
And the 4070 Super begins falling behind the 3090.

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.343
It appears to be being held back

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.078
by that 12 gigs of video memory

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:47.013
that we complained about before.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.481
If you were hoping that this refresh

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:51.117
then would push the prospect of 4K ultra gaming

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:52.919
to a lower price bracket,

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.421
I'm sorry, but that just isn't the case

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.223
and it appears to be by design.

00:05:57.223 --> 00:05:59.892
So with Nvidia's cards having names that are too long

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:01.828
and traditional raster gaming performance

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:04.864
that is at best competitive with AMD,

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:05.965
the question becomes,

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:09.435
are Nvidia's other features worth the price premium?

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:12.338
Let's take a quick detour into productivity and find out.

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:14.240
Now featuring, I'm so sorry,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.510
you must be so tired of hearing about it, AI benchmarks.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.713
The Procyon benchmark is testing the speed of inference

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:23.449
of various AI models on this hardware.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.319
Things like upscaling and object recognition

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.255
or generating images like with stable diffusion.

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:31.457
Like it'll see pixels and infer

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:33.793
that those pixels form a stop sign.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:37.163
And naturally we see Nvidia dominate here,

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:40.433
but this isn't just some architectural failure

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:41.868
on AMD's part.

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:44.003
A big part of it is software.

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:47.540
CUDA has been around for a long time now

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.709
and basically every AI program

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:52.545
is accelerated by Nvidia's CUDA cores.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:56.349
Whereas AMD is stuck in direct NL hell in this test

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:57.817
and just can't keep up.

00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:59.919
So we're gonna be working to build out an AI suite

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.256
that is more representative as time goes on.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.124
Of note, this is the first instance

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:07.693
where we see an actual increase in performance

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:11.731
from the 4080 refresh, excuse me, 4080 Super.

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:13.966
If AI is a major part of your workflow,

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:15.902
then you can be thankful that you're now getting

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:17.570
even better AI performance

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.006
for less money at the very high end.

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:21.140
Similarly in Blender,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.943
AMD is hamstrung by lacking software support

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.612
and we see Nvidia dominate the rendering race

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:30.249
even without taking advantage of their optics rendering.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:33.019
However, that uplift that we saw in AI workloads

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:38.791
on the 4080 Super has all but evaporated.

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:40.693
Let's talk about how Nvidia's AI horsepower

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:43.830
affects gaming now then with DLSS and FrameGen.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.097
As we've seen in the past,

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:48.668
an increase in AI cores doesn't correlate

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:52.338
to improved performance from DLSS and FrameGen.

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:54.240
You turn them on and they work

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.942
or you don't turn them on and they don't work.

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:59.145
You get roughly a 60% increase in FPS

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.013
from enabling DLSS with FrameGen

00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:02.949
regardless of which card you're using.

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:04.617
That is assuming it's green,

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:06.752
which dramatically increases performance

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:10.289
with what has become a pretty small difference

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.958
in visual fidelity.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.327
The increase in latency is measurable,

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.896
but outside of professional gamers and enthusiasts,

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:20.433
I think it's kind of reached the point where it's like,

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.368
well, why wouldn't I turn this on?

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:24.437
As for AMD, you might've noticed

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:26.839
that even though they finally launched

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.941
their driver level FrameGeneration,

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.777
we didn't include it in our results.

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:34.347
We wanted to be as apples to apples as possible.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.148
And in theory, it's really cool.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:38.551
You just turn it on in the adrenaline control panel

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:40.786
and it boosts your FPS in any DirectX 11

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.755
or DirectX 12 game.

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:43.756
Though like with Nvidia,

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.825
they do say you need decent performance already

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:49.362
for it to work its best with AMD recommending 60 FPS.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.731
The problem is that we were not able

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:55.234
to get consistent outputs such that we would be confident

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.502
putting them on our graphs.

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:59.138
So we've got some screen capture here for you guys

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:02.475
to give you some idea of what you might expect

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:04.410
in terms of a performance uplift.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.679
But I think it's gonna have to wait for a future video

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.882
to see how their fluid motion frames compare to Nvidia

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:12.952
when it comes to image quality and latency.

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:15.087
Another place, speaking of latency,

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:18.558
where AMD has lagged behind Nvidia has been ray tracing,

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.093
which doesn't change at all.

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:22.962
The introduction of these performance bumps

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:25.565
and the new SKUs will all but force AMD

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:29.302
to discount pretty much their entire current gen lineup,

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:30.536
at least if they wanna appeal

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:32.939
to ray tracing enthusiast gamers.

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.942
Post price cut, the 4080 now competes directly

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:39.011
with the 7900XTX with slightly better raster

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:41.414
and much better ray tracing performance

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.350
alongside other Nvidia walled off features.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.987
And the story is the same when it comes to power consumption.

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:50.222
Even with the bump to total power consumption,

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:52.792
Nvidia's new cards handily outclass AMD

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.160
in overall efficiency.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.695
And if you were worried that the power bump

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:57.496
would result in thermal problems,

00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:59.699
maybe on the 4080 Super for example,

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:01.567
you can rest easy knowing that thermals

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:04.136
on all of these cards were very much in check.

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.772
So you can rest easy and comfortably

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:08.641
in our new collection of pajamas.

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:10.576
We have onesies and lounge pants

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:13.079
now available at lttstore.com.

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:16.248
Now, is anyone else getting a sense of deja vu by now?

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:17.483
If you are, it's probably

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:20.252
cause you're pretty smart and observant.

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:23.956
Nvidia is pulling from the exact same playbook

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.093
as they did with the 20 series.

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:29.295
Seriously, stop me if this sounds familiar.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.030
You release a generation of cards

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.234
that is perceived as not offering a very good value.

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:37.136
And in fact, not offering much in the way

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:39.939
of a performance improvement over the last gen.

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:43.476
Then you do a mid cycle super refresh

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.144
so that you can say, yeah,

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:46.412
we know this one was kind of a downer,

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:48.881
but we're listening.

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:50.783
Well, that may have been a very long

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:52.451
four and a half years ago,

00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:54.220
but I haven't forgotten Nvidia.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.588
And how is it that you thought

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:57.957
that this was worth dragging out

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:01.260
over a month plus long series of launch events?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.230
Did anyone else notice that they gave nothing

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.334
to the gamers who already had the least this generation?

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:10.136
What about people who have less

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:15.141
than 500 US dollars to spend on a gaming accessory?

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:18.377
Nvidia is basically yielding that customer

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:20.579
to Sony or Microsoft.

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:21.781
So I hate to say it,

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:26.118
but unless Intel Arc Battle Mage swoops in to save us,

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:29.422
APUs might be the future that we have

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:32.191
to look forward to for budget PC gaming.

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:34.126
As for the future of this video,

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:36.162
it's the segue to our sponsor.

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:37.430
Ground News.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.597
No one likes to admit it,

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:41.434
but we all kind of live in our own bubbles,

00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:43.669
thanks in no small part to internet platforms

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.971
that feed us more and more stuff

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:48.441
that they think we'll like, including news.

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:51.210
But Ground News wants to change how we engage with news

00:11:51.243 --> 00:11:53.379
by helping us break free from algorithms,

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.980
see through media bias,

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.050
and better understand where we get our information from.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.555
To do this, their team processes nearly 60,000 news articles

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:06.125
from over 50,000 different news sources each day,

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:08.060
merging coverage of the same events

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.695
to give you a clearer picture

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:12.198
of just what the heck is going on out there.

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:14.200
Every story comes with this little bar

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.968
that breaks down the political leanings

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.870
of the outlets that are reporting on it.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.839
For example, here's a recent story

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:23.042
about OpenAI no longer banning the use of chat GPT

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.276
for military purposes.

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:26.712
Outlets from one side of the spectrum reported on it,

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.214
while it looks like the other side

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:29.615
didn't really find it that newsworthy.

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:30.816
And if you wonder why,

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:33.719
Ground News can help you dig more into those outlets

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:36.555
to have a look at what topics they cover,

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:39.291
which ones they don't, and why that might be.

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:41.293
It's time we had a smarter way to read the news.

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:44.630

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:50.536
If you guys enjoyed this video,

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:52.671
why don't you check out the one I alluded to earlier,

00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:54.273
where we analyzed the difference

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:57.843
between a dozen different identical AMD CPUs

00:12:57.843 --> 00:13:00.780
and showed how they don't always perform quite the same.
