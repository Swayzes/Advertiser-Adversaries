00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.503
- I grabbed 50 random people
and a brand new Lamborghini.

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:06.506
Everyone put your right hand on the car.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:10.643
Whoever takes their hand off
last gets the $300,000 car.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.379
(cheers)

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.914
And I have over 50
different cameras monitoring

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:16.750
every single hand on the Lamborghini.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.584
We'll know if they take it off.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.319
- Do you see how beautiful this car is?

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.287
It will be mine.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.355
- As long as it takes,

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.289
we're not going home.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.257
- I'm already ready to go home.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.392
- You're probably wondering,

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.860
how do you use the bathroom?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.661
Chris, rip off the windshield wiper.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.031
(cheers)

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.732
We now have a windshield wiper

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.467
that if you're touching
with your right hand,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.403
you are still technically
touching the car.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:37.270
There you go.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.772
You can get off the car.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:39.973
(cheers)

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.409
I expected people to
get out in weird ways,

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.811
but I wasn't expecting
a little bit of water

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:45.945
to be one of 'em.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.248
(yelling)

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.916
- Oh, he's out.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:50.750
- What happened?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.852
- It was all in my face and I reacted.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:54.888
- Congratulations on being first out.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.256
Here's a 1,000 dollars.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.058
49 of you remain.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.559
(cheers)

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.393
- It wasn't on purpose!

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:01.828
- You took the Lamborghini from that man.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.630
- I know! And I feel bad, Cole.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.498
Someone's eliminated.
Oh, I feel bad for them.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:06.332
(laughs)

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.101
- 49 left, I'm not gonna be one of them.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.736
- I think a lot of people
are gonna start slipping up,

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.237
because my brain's already slipping up.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.305
It's only been 3 hours.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:14.607
(rock music)

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.342
- Raise your right hand if you're hungry.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:17.177
(crickets chirp)

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:18.445
(laughs)

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.046
One of these times,
we're gonna get someone.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.548
But anyways, we brought you all pizza.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:22.415
Give me a second.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.717
(cheers)

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:25.952
- Oh yeah, good stuff.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.353
- I'm hoping that while
they're all eating,

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.589
some people slip up and
take their hands off.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.424
And with so many people packed together

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.027
it didn't take long for
something to happen.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.728
- Somebody stepped on my foot,

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:36.896
and I moved my hand.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.298
I got to see my kid, Doug.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:39.165
(crowd awws)

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.300
- The Lambo would've been cool though.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.434
- [Mr. Beast] It's harder than it looks

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.369
to remember not to use one of your hands.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.038
All it takes is one little slip-up

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:47.140
and one of our 50 cameras will catch it.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.274
The water bottle falls.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.109
- Yep.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.943
- You go to pick it up.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.377
You then stare at the camera.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.279
(contestants laugh)

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.882
Whoever gets out next
gets a special prize,

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.417
but you have 10 seconds.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.251
- Me!

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.119
- [Mr. Beast] 10.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.153
9.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:00.987
- 8?

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:03.656
- [Mr. Beast] It is a brand new Nissan.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:04.791
- Shut up!

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.060
- Congratulations on the brand new car.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.294
Later, nerds. Drive us off.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.529
- I don't know where we're going.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.598
- And in case you're
wondering, every single person

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:14.134
on that Lamborghini is
walking away with a prize.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.568
You should subscribe so you can compete

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:16.503
in one of these videos.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.171
(upbeat music)

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.573
It's almost midnight and I'm
gonna give them sleeping bags

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.909
because I want them to fall
asleep and accidentally

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.577
take their hand off the Lamborghini.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.045
Who wants the sleeping bags?

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.881
There you go, here's a sleeping bag.

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.282
I did not mean to hit him in the nuts.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.250
There's some sleeping bags.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.084
All right, everybody.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.152
Get a good night's rest.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.286
- I think these guys on the ground

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.221
definitely have a top tier strategy.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.589
We don't trust ourselves sleeping

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:37.991
because our hands are gonna move.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.359
- [Mr. Beast] It turns out he was right.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.061
- Someone fell asleep and I
don't feel like waking him up.

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.365
I'm gonna give him $1,000
with this sticky note.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:46.199
(laughs)

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.968
(dramatic music)

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.207
So you woke up and what'd you find?

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.108
- $1,000.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.609
- Who put that there?

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.443
- I don't know.

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.278
(melancolic music)

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.112
(upbeat music)

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.914
- [Mr. Beast] Good morning, everybody.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:03.249
28 of you survived the night.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.317
How are you feeling?

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.685
- Half the team here
hate me, I don't know.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.087
- I hate him, he talks too much.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:10.623
- Oh wow. Really?

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:11.691
- I'm gonna be honest boys,

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:12.926
you've been pretty tame this video.

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:13.760
- Ooh.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.328
Let's create mischief.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.496
- And mayhem.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.764
- Can I scooch past you?

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:19.632
(car revs)

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.701
Do you think that'd scare anybody?

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.903
If I did one of those real
loud and they're like, oh.

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:26.906
(car revs loudly)

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:29.609
(contestants yell)

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.212
I literally just said, do
you think that could happen?

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.613
- I just grabbed the bottle

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:35.715
and I'd looked up and I was like, dang,

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:36.783
I'm toast!

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.519
- Welcome.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.353
Here's some prizes.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.187
- Thanks so much, bro.

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:42.255
Still walked out with something.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.223
Let's go!

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.057
- Could've won a Lambo.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.359
- It's time we do something special, okay?

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.193
Bring in the ramp.

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:48.494
Full disclosure everybody,

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.597
we've built this ramp
for the last 10 minutes.

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.432
So, who knows what will happen?

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:54.734
(crowd cheers)

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.136
(rock music)

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:01.307
Oh, she clapped?

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.208
- I know, I clapped.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.476
- Oh, really?

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:04.477
- [Crew Member] Let's go!

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.045
- We are now in the top 20.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:09.148
Only 19 people stand between
you and a Lamborghini.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:11.184
(electronic music)

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.218
Attention, everybody.

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:13.219
I have an announcement.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.855
We just dropped our brand new documentary.

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.457
While I'm telling the viewers about it,

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.058
if one of you make a basketball shot

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:20.026
I'll give you 10 grand.

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:22.095
Our brand new documentary
is only available

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.296
on CuriosityStream.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.099
(contestants cheer)

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.933
Did someone make it?

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:27.867
I need to do this quick.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:30.036
CuriosityStream is the
number one streaming service

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:32.238
for science shows, space
shows, history shows,

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:34.274
basically anything educational

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.742
CuriosityStream has it.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.412
Somehow while being jam-packed full of

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:40.680
educational information,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.815
the shows are also
still very entertaining.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:43.650
All right.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.484
And stop shooting, stop shooting.

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:46.552
And like I said, it
also has our documentary

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.521
which I'll tell you how to
watch at the end of this video.

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:51.090
Of course, David freaking won the $10,000.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.292
This guy's always winning money.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.126
- Thank you.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.360
- And congratulations, Corey.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.495
- Thank you.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:56.429
- At least this time you
didn't get out during the show.

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:57.297
- Yeah.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.599
(electronic music)

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.434
- We're a little over a
day into this challenge

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:03.236
and so far 30 people have gone out.

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:05.571
I wanna get to the top
10 as soon as possible.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.640
So I'm gonna bring out the big guns.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.675
Bring her on.

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:10.943
As you can see, we have
another car to give away.

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:12.645
How many of you would like to walk away

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.113
with this brand new Mustang?

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:14.947
- It's a Camaro.

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:16.282
- It's a Camaro. I don't know cars.

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.151
Chris, can you drive it
back down and go hide it?

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.919
- [Chris] Yeah, I'll go ahead.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.522
- And I think you guys can
piece where I'm going with this.

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:24.791
Whoever touches the
Camaro first can keep it.

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:25.825
(running sound effect)

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.327
(contestants cheer)

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.494
- [Mr. Beast] Oh!

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:29.595
(crowd voices overlap)

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:30.697
- Oh, we got another one.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:33.099
(rock music)

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:43.776
- I wonder where the car is.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:44.610
- Oh my gosh.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.179
(screaming)

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.715
- Congrats on the new car.

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:49.816
- [Chandler] Yeah, that's a
good commercial for the car.

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:50.650
(car crashes)

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.251
Oh.

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:54.153
- Good thing we got other cars, right?

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:56.689
And now that those 4 contestants are out,

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.424
16 of you remain.

00:05:58.424 --> 00:05:59.759
(contestants cheer)

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.761
Since these contestants survived this far,

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:03.896
I decided to reward them with some steak.

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.332
And I didn't realize how
hard it is to eat steak

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:07.467
with only one hand.

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:08.801
- It's so hard to eat.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.904
- You got caught in 4k.

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.673
Here's the typical $1,000 prize.

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:15.174
Give it to random children if you want.

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:16.242
- I will do that.

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:17.677
- Jimmy took a nap but before he did

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:18.878
he gave us a bunch of money.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.213
- So we put it in a cannon.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.414
(cannon fires)

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:22.448
That hurt my knee.

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:23.282
3, 2, 1.

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.122
The strategy is when they
try to pick up the money,

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:31.124
they're gonna take their hand off the car.

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.625
- [Mr. Beast] And, it didn't work.

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:33.993
And then they all went to sleep.

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.495
Morning, everybody.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:36.729
It's hard to wake you all up,

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.798
but two of you literally just got out.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.501
We will start off with
our first victim, Corey.

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:43.903
- You just regained consciousness,

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:47.273
and couldn't figure out
where you were for a second.

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:49.642
- Our next person in question is asleep.

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.010
Oh, she did it again.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.845
We don't have to show the footage now.

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:53.846
- Woo!

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:56.249
- We are one person off 10 people left,

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.152
which is exactly when this
challenge starts to get hard.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:00.286
(contestants cheer)

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:01.554
- Final 10, baby.

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:03.156
And then it's gonna get crazy.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.490
- We're about to do something crazy.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.726
- I have been waiting for
this moment this whole time.

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:09.328
- Tomorrow's gonna be a
very big day for all of you.

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.631
So I'm gonna allow you to
duct-tape your hand to the car

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.599
for the night so you can get some sleep.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.468
- I don't know if this is good or bad.

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:17.637
- Oh yeah, I can relax
my hand at some point.

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:18.805
Oh God.

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:19.939
Okay. Maybe not, I lied.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.841
- I didn't interact with
them for a few hours

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:23.976
so they could fall asleep and
I could see what happened.

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:26.012
Let's just say that
people aren't that great

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.513
at keeping their hand on the Lamborghini

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:28.414
while they're asleep.

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:29.916
Let's go break the news to 'em.

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:31.184
All right, everybody.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:34.587
As you can tell by the red
lights, Armageddon has happened.

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:36.756
Fidias, how many people
do you think got out?

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:37.590
- One?

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.925
- I hate to break the news to you but

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:40.760
half of you are literally out.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.661
- Oh my God.

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:42.862
- [Mr. Beast] Everyone,
point your eyeballs

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:43.896
at the projector.

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:45.431
Up first is our boy Danny,

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:47.400
both your hands are clearly off.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.135
- [Danny] I was asleep,
I didn't even know.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.870
- Our next victim is David.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.672
It appears your luck ran out.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:56.909
An itchy nose just cost
you a $300,000 Lamborghini.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.778
Up next, we have a Double Whammy.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.613
So, we'll start off with our boy Neil.

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:01.647
You can clearly see

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:04.050
there's just no contact whatsoever, Neil.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.884
It's okay.

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:05.751
Just another

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.186
(Akira cheers)

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:10.723
- Akira, if you look up here
at the screen, you're fine.

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:13.926
But your brother over here
might have some issues.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.130
Scratched your head.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.398
- Are you kidding me?

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:21.634
- [Mr. Beast] And then
went back under the tape.

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:23.503
Now that you've actually experienced it,

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.271
do you understand how he
lost a million dollars?

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:26.205
- Yeah, definitely.

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:27.607
This far in, it's a different realm.

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:30.109
- 1 final person has gotten out.

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:32.245
All right, pause it.

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:34.680
(contestants cheer)

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.982
(contestant screams)

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.450
I'm afraid she's gonna kill me.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.985
At least your boyfriend's still in.

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.386
- Win this car for us!

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:42.388
- Everybody follow me in the prize room.

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:44.757
As a reward for making it to the top 10,

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:45.858
grab whatever you want.

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:46.893
You want that one, you want one?

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:47.793
Take another iPhone.

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.795
We'll make sure you guys
all walk out with some cash.

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:50.663
Here, take an iPad.

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:51.697
- I know there's a car out there,

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:52.965
but I'm low-key happy right now.

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:54.100
You know what I mean?

00:08:56.235 --> 00:08:57.069
- [Mr. Beast] Oh my God.

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:59.038
This is why you've lost two Lamborghinis.

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:02.008
And after all of that, 6 of you remain.

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:04.176
One of you is literally
walking away with this

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:05.678
brand new Lamborghini.

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.114
This is what the Lamborghini
looked like at the beginning,

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:09.882
and this is what it looks like now.

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:12.151
And now it's time for the big surprise.

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:17.990
The Lamborghini is now being raised.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.824
- Higher.

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:23.095
- And now the Lamborghini
has lifted 2 entire feet

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:23.930
off the ground,

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.631
and I can raise it all
the way up to the ceiling.

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:28.334
Do not forget that a
Lamborghini's on the line

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:30.136
and only one of you is getting it.

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:32.538
- It's not on the line, its in the air.

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:34.473
- This whole thing for me has
been about mental toughness.

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:37.009
- You gotta eliminate the
risk of mental failure

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.843
as much as possible.

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:40.246
- I want to get as much rest as possible

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.547
because I have a funny feeling

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:43.316
this will get more difficult.

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:45.418
- Me and Nolan have pretended to be asleep

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.620
in this Lamborghini for like an hour.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.554
(car honks)

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:49.922
Should I open up the trunk?

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.293
Oh my God, he got out,

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:55.127
he got out, he got out.

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:56.062
- What did you wanna tell us?

00:09:56.062 --> 00:09:57.530
- When you pulled this latch up,

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.564
I think my hand came up.

00:09:58.564 --> 00:09:59.432
- We know it came up.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.333
Here's the footage.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:01.634
As a prize for making this far,

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:03.669
we're gonna give you $10,000 in cash.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.440
- I actually meant to
lift the front trunk.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.841
- Are you kidding me?

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:10.710
- And now that only 5 people remain,

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.345
Chandler, raise the Lamborghini!

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.846
You can raise it as high as you want

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:15.915
but that's probably a good spot.

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:16.749
You can stop.

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:19.685
I'm, I was about to run
over there, make it stop!

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:21.053
This is where things get fun

00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:22.722
because every time someone gets out

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:24.156
we're gonna raise the Lambo.

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:25.758
(intense music)

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.360
Akira, what's going on buddy?

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.362
- [Akira] Jimmy, I'm at my breaking point.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:30.196
- Think about it.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.530
Think about the million dollar challenge

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.898
100 people last leave circle.

00:10:32.898 --> 00:10:34.367
- [Akira] Jimmy, I'm not cut out for this.

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:35.468
I promise you though,

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.836
put me in the next challenge.

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.070
I will train every day.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.306
- If that's the case,
I'll shake your right hand

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.508
and guarantee you a spot
in the next challenge.

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:43.342
- Put it there, Jimmy.

00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:44.377
- Oh, let's go!

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.444
- Let's go!

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:47.480
- You just won $10,000 in cash.

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:50.282
- My right arm can't take it.

00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:51.851
- Enough of this $10,000.

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.686
You need to go train
for the next challenge.

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.154
We now have 4 players left.

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:56.222
Chandler, raise it.

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:59.325
I give you permission to
go as high as you want.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.393
That's probably high enough.

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:01.460
Chandler, if you go higher

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.628
Carl's not gonna be able to get out.

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:04.296
- I don't think I can anymore anyway.

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:05.331
- We trapped Carl.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.165
If you haven't already,

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.800
hit the subscribe button below the video,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.735
because this took a lot of time to put up.

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:11.604
I could make them do laps
around the Lamborghini,

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:13.639
stand on one leg and all sorts of things

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:14.540
to make this really hard.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.342
But instead I'm just gonna leave them be

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:18.244
and see who actually wants it the most.

00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:19.111
No messing around,

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:20.746
whoever has the most determination

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:22.148
is winning that Lamborghini.

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:22.982
Between me and you,

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.183
who are you the most afraid of?

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:25.051
- Myself failing.

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:26.252
- Wow, what a deep answer.

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.186
How about you, good sir.

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:28.154
How long have you lasted?

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:30.089
- I have a tattoo, your name.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:32.391
- Since when did you get
a tattoo of my name here?

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.492
- You are my idol.

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:35.094
I don't want to disappoint you.

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:36.295
- Disappointing me is irrelevant.

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:37.730
A Lamborghini's on the line.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.231
(intense music)

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:41.467
It's been 10 hours since someone got out,

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:42.435
let's make it harder.

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:45.438
We're gonna switch from a
hand to a single finger.

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:47.540
Which finger are you choosing?

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.507
The pointer finger.

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:49.341
Okay.

00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:50.276
Which finger are you choosing?

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:51.844
- Going to the pointer as well.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:52.912
- Okay, pointer finger.

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:54.346
Oh, keep that bad boy on.

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:55.715
- Oh, this is hard, boy.

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:58.617
- All that matters is that pointer finger.

00:11:58.617 --> 00:11:59.819
They pick pointer fingers.

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:01.020
She picked her pinky.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.888
We have a Lamborghini on the line.

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:04.056
These are big decisions.

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.157
Pointer finger, okay.

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:06.726
Three people chose their pointer finger

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.294
and she chose her pinky.

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:10.162
As of now, you all know the rules,

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:11.564
things got more interesting.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.800
- I'm 100% sure now that
you don't fake videos.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.236
Because I've been awake for 50 hours.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.271
- [Mr. Beast] Standing for this
long was really starting to

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:20.606
wear the contestants down.

00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:23.209
And soon enough, they
started making some offers.

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:24.710
What are you proposing, sir?

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.346
- How about a flat 20,
and one of those MacBooks?

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:29.248
- You drive a hard bargain. I love it.

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:32.685
20 grand and a MacBook,
if you get out right now.

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:33.753
Oh my gosh!

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.555
As you requested, here's $20,000

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:38.624
in cash and a brand new MacBook.

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:41.026
Congratulations in coming in 4th place.

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:42.561
You said you had a proposal.

00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:43.395
Let me hear it.

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:46.832
- 25,000 would cover a
portion of my student loans,

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:49.935
my phone and my roommate's
phone broke in the last week.

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:53.072
- Replacing your phones and
25 grand for student loans.

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:54.273
I don't have a problem with that.

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.674
Let's shake on it.

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:56.642
Oh my gosh.

00:12:56.642 --> 00:12:58.444
Oh, and her hand's very sweaty.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.879
All their hands are sweaty.

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.280
Thank you for coming out.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.481
I hope you had fun.

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:06.252
- 50 people comes down to
two people, is me and you.

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:08.320
- Oh my gosh! I'm just kidding.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.355
- This is crazy.

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.356
- You're saying this is crazy?

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:12.291
Wait for me to raise the Lamborghini.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.660
- No! No!

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.961
- Good luck, Fidias.

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.163
- Yeah, I, whoa.

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:19.231
- What? That wasn't much.

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:20.065
- Enough.

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:21.133
- Are you on your tippy toes?

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:22.168
- Yes! Please.

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:25.504
- Okay. All right, fine. I'll chill.

00:13:25.504 --> 00:13:26.505
Okay.

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:28.440
- Gentlemen, one of you is walking away

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.442
with this Lamborghini above your head.

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:32.378
And one of you isn't.

00:13:32.378 --> 00:13:33.212
Good luck.

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.313
- I'm coming for Fidias.

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:37.583
No matter what, even if
it takes the death of me.

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:38.818
- [Fidias] I love you, brother.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:39.652
- Love you too.

00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:43.155
- Your arm is fully extended.

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:44.557
Your finger has to be hurting.

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:45.424
- Oh, really?

00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:46.325
- Yeah.

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:47.426
- Oh, really?

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:50.129
- It doesn't feel great.

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:51.397
Hurting so bad.

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:53.232
- Your finger's shaking
more than I've seen

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:54.066
this whole challenge.

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:58.637
2nd place does give 40 grand,
which isn't a $350,000 car

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:00.673
but 40 grand's better than nothing.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:01.507
Oh, well.

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:02.408
Seriously think about this.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:03.642
- It hurts so bad.

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:05.778
- How about Fidias is just like.

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:07.947
- He's in no pain, and I'm dying.

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:10.216
- Just take it off!

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:11.083
- No!

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:12.251
- Oh my goodness.

00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:13.953
It's only you.

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:16.422
(Noah screams)

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:18.123
- Oh my gosh!

00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:20.159
I didn't know if you were joking or not.

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:21.260
- I just won!

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:30.569
- Here is $40,000 in cash, and Fidias!

00:14:31.837 --> 00:14:33.839
Are you crying for real?

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.541
And while he's driving
his brand new Lamborghini

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:38.010

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.246
