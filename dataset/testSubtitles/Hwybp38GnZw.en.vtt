00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:02.435
- I've recreated Willy
Wonka's Chocolate Factory

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:03.269
in real life.

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.305
And one of these 10
people is gonna walk away

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:06.606
with this chocolate factory.

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:07.974
(all cheering)

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:08.908
- [Jimmy] In we go.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.444
(all oohing and awing)

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:12.245
- [Chris] Wow.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:13.079
- [Chandler] Yo.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.714
- Welcome to my wonderful creation.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.017
- Oh my gosh, it is Candy Land in here.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.985
Look at the river!

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:20.153
- It's a chocolate door.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:20.987
(chomping sound)

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:21.821
Oh he's taking a bite out of our door.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:22.655
- That's good.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:23.823
- [Jimmy] These 10
contestants are all here

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.291
because they found a golden ticket

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.826
when they bought one
of our Feastable Bars.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.928
For our first challenge, we're
gonna play hide and seek.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.630
You have a thousand seconds go hide.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.464
(all talking)

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.767
- One, two, three, four.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:34.768
- [Contestant] Oh okay, we gotta go hide.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:35.635
Let's go. Let's go!

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.938
- Oh, look at this Coca-Cola
handle, oh my gosh.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.040
- Oh, yo dude.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.710
It's a marshmallow area,
what the heck is this?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.445
(all counting)

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:46.446
- 201, 202, 5

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.547
- What about these?

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:50.850
I don't know if I can fit in here, see ya!

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.684
(lid clangs)

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:52.519
Anyhow.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.853
- Hey, the factory's awesome.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.923
- This doesn't feel real at
all, feels like I'm dreaming.

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:59.793
- Yo, what in the, what even is this area?

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.829
(dramatic music)

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.531
- Thousand, let's go!

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:05.832
If I were to hide anywhere in

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.100
Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.069
I'd probably hide in the chocolate river.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.071
I don't feel like checking
it, so if they did they win.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.373
It's one of our side rooms
in the chocolate factory.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.374
- [Chandler] Cake.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:15.208
- [Jimmy] No, no.

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:16.042
- [Chandler] I can't have any?

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.277
- Obviously you can't
have a chocolate factory

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.378
without offices to manage it.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.180
No one in here.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.648
Let's go this way.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:25.085
- [Logan] Mm. Surely,
nobody's hiding in here.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.619
- [Chris] I don't see anybody.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.054
- [Logan] Nobody's in here either.

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.856
- And this is the Wollamhsram Room.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:30.924
- [Tareq] What are you saying right now?

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.358
- That's marshmallow backwards.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.326
- [Tareq] Oh, okay.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.160
- Yeah, duh.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.895
- Jimmy, oh, we were
just calling you Jimmy.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.264
We found this really awesome hiding spot.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.632
- Oh no.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.467
- Oh no.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.901
- [Jimmy] And it's the
guy dressed up cool.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:42.902
- [Chris] It's the cowboy.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:43.703
- No.

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:45.939
- All right, this way, watch
out for the giant candy cane.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.307
You've seen the movie before, right?

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:48.141
- I have.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.576
- All right then you know
you must get in the boat,

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.410
- In the boat.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.212
- Don't ask me how but
we put a chocolate river

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:55.615
with a chocolate waterfall in
the middle of this warehouse.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.883
(all saying bye)

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:57.917
(gun Shots)

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.018
- [Contestant] Bye Jimmy

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.286
- Part, the waterfall.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.222
- I thought this was gonna stop, oh no.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.191
(both yelling)

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.693
- The waterfall was supposed to part,

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:07.861
but I guess that messed up.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.530
Our next challenge is on the
side of the Chocolate Factory.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.332
I call it the Candy Wall of Death.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.000
Sounds a lot scarier than it is.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.868
Yes welcome!

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:16.970
- My gosh -
- Oh what the?

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.804
- So tall.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.572
- Welcome to the rock wall.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:20.607
(gong crashes)

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:21.574
- I gave Chris a gong.

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:24.210
The last person up the
candy wall is eliminated.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.912
Contestants, are you ready?

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:27.380
(all shouting)

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.214
- Go!

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.048
- [Chris] Go, go, go, go.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:29.883
- Okay.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.151
Oh we already have someone fall.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.419
Oh bro, that guy is
getting up there quick.

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.321
- Woo.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.156
Are you all right, sir?

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:36.990
- Appreciate it.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.891
- Let's go get up there.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.859
- How does he know how to climb candy?

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:40.894
- Ah! -
- What'd you say?

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.462
- Ah! -
- Okay!

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.296
- For the Chocolate Factory!

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.731
- [Chris] This ain't no normal prize,

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.199
this is a whole factory.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.033
(gong crashes)

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.067
- Ring the button, ring the button.

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:48.902
(bell rings)

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:49.736
- [Chris] Okay.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.171
- [Contestant] Yes sir!

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.005
- [Female Contestant] Oh, I cannot.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.240
- Remember, our chocolate
factory is on the line.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.942
Actually the chocolate
factory you're climbing.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:56.876
You gotta press the red button.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.212
[bells ringing]

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:00.947
- Step on it. Step on
something else with your leg.

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:03.683
- Don't let a Reese's Pieces
cost you a chocolate factory.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:04.884
- [Contestant] I can't.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.119
[all shouting]

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:09.055
- [Jimmy] You can keep going.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:12.258
- (all shouting)

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.160
- These two were unable
to make it to the top.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.763
So the only logical thing to
do is rock, paper, scissors.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:19.098
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:20.266
- Oh I got it.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.136
- Well, congratulations.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.304
Let's head over to the chocolate river.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:28.107
Here's an umbrella in case the
waterfall malfunctions again.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:29.042
- [Everyone] Bye!

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.311
- [Chris] Who would've thought
a river made of chocolate

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:32.845
is not very practical?

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:35.281
- And now that she's gone,
pair up into groups of two.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.083
Is everyone happy with their partners?

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.051
- [Everyone] Yeah.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.452
- All right, Next challenge.

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.754
And now we have the two
greatest eaters in the world.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:42.589
Get out the way.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.423
- [Chris] Excuse me.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:44.691
- Matt Stonie and Joey Chestnut.

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:45.992
(all cheering)

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:47.627
And they're gonna demonstrate
the next challenge.

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:49.862
Bring out the chocolate,
not this chocolate.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.764
This is our chocolate bars
that you can order online.

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.733
And we have two brand new Feastables bars:

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:54.934
milk chocolate and sea salt.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.669
Can you show us how to speed eat this?

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.503
- Absolutely.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:58.338
- Yeah.

00:03:58.338 --> 00:03:59.405
- Hey, all you guys should take notes.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.573
(crunching sounds)

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.975
- [Chris] That's insane.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:02.809
(slurping sounds)

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.911
- I feel like I'm gonna
throw up just watching them.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.446
(uptempo music)

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.814
- I think you all get the gist,

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:10.416
last team to eat the chocolate
bars, obviously eliminated.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.751
Begin the contest.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:13.720
- [Contestant] Go for it.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.854
- The challenge has officially started.

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:16.256
Two people will lose.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.024
- You guys literally
saw what you have to do.

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:20.393
Shove it in your mouth and
then shove water in your mouth.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.561
- Chew and swallow, chew and swallow.

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:22.829
Water's your best friend. Keep it going.

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:23.696
- Keep it going in your mouth.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.231
- I think they've made
the most progress so far.

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.065
- I'm lactose intolerant.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:26.899
(squeaky laughter)

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.201
- That's dark chocolate,
not milk chocolate.

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:29.035
So you're good.

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:29.869
- I'm good.
- Yeah!

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:31.804
- [Logan] There's a chocolate
factory on the line.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.273
- I've been trying really
hard to lose weight.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.341
This is like counterproductive.

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.175
- It's getting hot.

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:37.176
- You doing okay?
- Mm-hm

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:39.679
- Bro, you're sweating,
can someone gimme a napkin?

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:40.947
(mumbling)

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.849
(dramatic music)

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.717
- They are officially our first winners.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:46.552
- Yeah -
- Yeah we did it!

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.621
- You technically haven't
won until you swallow that.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.455
(swallowing hard)

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:50.423
- We got our first winners over there.

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.357
- It doesn't matter who wins.

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.192
It just matters who loses.

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:54.294
- Come on you got this

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.528
- That team was in last place.

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:57.063
Now they're gonna come
back and beat you guys.

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:57.997
- You got plenty of time.

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:00.033
Just focus on getting it down, mouth open.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:01.334
Hey, we got it!

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:02.402
- Yes!

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:03.703
- Those two guys are getting close.

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.171
It's kind of now or never for you guys.

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.439
- They are about ready to finish.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.041
You guys have to go fast right now.

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.008
- Slam it back

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:09.842
- Right now!

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:10.677
- Chris, are they are they

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:12.812
- They're chewing, they're
chewing their last piece.

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.380
- Swallow it, swallow it and you can win.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.949
- First one to clear, we gotta
see open mouth, open mouth.

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.418
- All right, his mouth's
empty, its down to him.

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:19.252
- Get it out, get it out.

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:20.086
Yeah. Got it.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:20.953
- His mouth's empty, so done.

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.355
- Oh yeah!

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:23.623
- So close!

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:24.924
- The chocolate's amazing.

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:27.193
But at a portion, oh my God.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:28.394
- To the chocolate river.

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:29.228
Goodbye.

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:30.496
- What's it like being
in the chocolate river

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:32.332
after eating a pound of chocolate?

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.166
- I don't know.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.034
- Make sure you watch the end
of the video because I have a

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:37.303
special surprise guest
that will blow your mind.

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:39.906
And now the final six
contestants are outside.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:41.574
And can you guys take your blindfolds off

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:42.408
and look to the right?

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.111
This is the one's largest bottle of Coke.

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:46.346
Chandler, can you hold my cane?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.547
- Yes.

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:48.381
(claps hands)

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:49.749
- [Jimmy] And there we
go, editing is cool.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:50.583
- How'd I get up here?

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.118
- If you land the world's largest Mento

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:54.320
in the world's largest
bottle of Coke, you win.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.521
Don't forget this building,

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.323
everything you know is on the line.

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:58.624
- This is half a million dollars.

00:05:58.624 --> 00:05:59.692
- Well, I mean, if not more.

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:00.793
- Uh. -
- Oh

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:02.462
- In, in the bottle.

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:03.629
- Yes. In the bottle.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:05.932
- No, no, no, no, in!

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:07.800
- Let's see how many times we
can get Chandler to say that.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.402
Don't forget if you make
this that could determine

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:11.404
whether or not you want
a chocolate factory.

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:12.238
- First try.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:14.707
- I think that was the worst one yet.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.709
[Dramatic Music]

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.044
- [Everyone] Oh!

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.279
- In and out!

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.981
- [Chandler] This is it, this is the one.

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.583
- [Everyone] Yeah!

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.952
- Let's go!

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:28.921
(all cheering)

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.189
- It flew so high.

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:31.524
- Whoever wins the Chocolate Factory,

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:33.292
you might have a, a
little stain on the side.

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.094
Since he was the one that made the shot,

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:37.196
he gets to pick who's eliminated,

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:39.198
look at these five people right here.

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:40.266
- Oh, this is hard.

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:41.434
- I mean, it could be you if you want.

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:42.568
- No, I think I'll pass on that,

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:43.403
(all laughing)

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.270
Eric, I'm sorry.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.805
(crowd groans)

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.441
- I don't know I'm, please forgive me man.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:50.410
- Well, you know what that
means, chocolate river.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.779
This is a smaller version of
the Mentos you were throwing.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.916
And if you look right here,
here is a solid gold Mentos.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.419
Here you go, you can sell it
when you leave the factory.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.887
- You better win this now.

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:02.722
- I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.357
- If you're wondering where that goes.

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:06.292
I don't even know, next challenge.

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:08.327
Now we're in a room
covered with marshmallows.

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:09.462
Dive on the floor.

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:10.430
(Logan grunts)

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.264
Did that hurt?

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.098
- No, not at all.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.199
- And in front of each of the contest,

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.567
I don't trust you with the flamethrower.

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:16.269
Can you stand just a little more that way.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.670
And in front of each contestants,

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.039
it's a little peppermint
carousel, can you all stand on it?

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.741
The challenge has officially begun.

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.509
Whoever falls off first loses.

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:24.944
- Do you feel bad about what you did?

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:25.778
- I feel awful.

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:26.813
- All right, just step off it.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:27.680
- No, I won't do it.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.681
- You can do it

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:29.749
- No.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:30.583
- Don't push.

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:31.818
- Currently they're not spinning.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.252
So let's move this here.

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:35.688
Now they're spinning just a
little bit, how is it everybody?

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:36.522
- Pretty fine

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:37.356
- Pretty good?

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:38.191
- Good so far.
- So far so good.

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.091
- Whoa.

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:40.193
- I think he was making fun of it.

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:41.227
You want me to ramp it up?

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:42.061
- I dare you.

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:42.929
- All right, we're ramping it up.

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:44.163
Now they're spinning faster.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:46.132
They all kinda look like MPCs, you know,

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.434
in the character
selection where they spin.

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:49.268
You know what I mean?

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:51.737
If you step here, step
right while you're doing it,

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:52.905
it'll help you with the sickness.

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:53.973
Like 'cause you don't have to spin,

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:54.941
you can just step in place.

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:56.609
- Don't trust Jimmy. I don't trust that.

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:58.544
- That seems scary. Oh, oh.

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:02.782
(everyone yelling)

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:03.716
- What do you do now?

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:05.818
(everyone yelling)

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:06.819
- Why did that hit me in the head?

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:07.687
- Even though he got out,

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:09.355
I wanna show you guys
the faster speeds 'cause

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.624
I spent a lot of money on this.

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:12.658
- [Jimmy] Look at him over there.

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:13.493
- Ah!

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:17.330
- I can't feel my toes.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.164
- To the river.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.131
Before you step in the boat,

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:20.500
I need you to assign them a number.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.635
One through four to each
of them, who is number one?

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:23.603
- Dallin. -
- One?

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:24.470
- Okay, so who's number two?

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.304
- Justin.

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:26.339
- Number three?

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.173
- Brian

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.341
- Are you just going
in order of the layout?

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.175
- I really am.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:29.976
- Oh, that's cheap.

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:31.110
All right, fine, get in the boat.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.579
- One last sweet treat
for the road, my guy.

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:35.248
- Ah, thank you.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.082
Watch you fall in.

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:38.484
- That could determine who
loses a chocolate factory.

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:39.819
Let's show you why that's relevant.

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.220
There's four toilets behind me.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.822
Three are real, ones made of a cake.

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:45.358
Whichever person picks the
cake one is eliminated.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.492
- So if they're right they're wrong?

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:49.562
- No, they have to be
right about the wrong one.

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:50.630
- [Jimmy] I'm not joking.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.132
One of those toilets is
literally made of cake

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:55.101
and whoever picks the cake toilet

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:56.702
loses the chocolate factory.

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:58.638
We're gonna start things off
with number one over here.

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.473
Take your blindfold off,
you have five seconds.

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:03.442
Five, four, three, two

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:04.243
- Two.

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:05.077
- Alight.

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:05.912
So you're picking toilet number two.

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:07.113
Stand in front of it and face this way.

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:08.381
Now we have number two, are you ready?

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.215
- Yep.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.049
- Take the blindfold off.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.218
Five, four, three,

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.052
- [Contestant] One.

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:13.886
- Okay, go for it.

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:16.856
Alight, that leaves only
toilet three and four left.

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:19.926
Five, four, three, two

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:20.760
- Three

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.694
- Okay, you pick toilet number three.

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:23.062
So I hate to break the news to you,

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:24.196
but there's only one toilet left.

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:25.731
So you can just go walk in front of it.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.233
Three of these toilets are real.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.435
One is made of cake,
can you guys sit down?

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:33.439
(intense music)

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:34.373
- Oh. -
- Oh yeah.

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.544
- Everyone his toilet
was the one made of cake.

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:39.679
- [Contestant] No, man.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.548
- Oh my God the cane.

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:43.449
- The cane is no more.

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:45.351
I don't know if you guys have
ever made a toilet out a cake,

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.253
but this took forever.
So please subscribe.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.087
- Can you flush that?

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:48.921
[Everyone Laughs]

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.891
- You know the deal, on the bridge.

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:53.726
- Better you than me dude.

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:54.560
- [Jimmy] Oh my God.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.095
- Sorry, but you had to go at some point,

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:56.896
if I was gonna win.

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:58.531
- Have fun in Arizona, I'll
see you soon down there.

00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.865
- {Jimmy} Oh my gosh.

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:01.968
- Oh, I don't know if
this is wholesome or not.

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:02.868
- Hey, don't worry Jimmy.

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:04.770
Being a boat captain's a piece of cake.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.605
(strong base)

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.139
- And we have one final challenge left

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:08.841
that will decide which
one of you walks away

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:10.109
with this chocolate factory.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.677
We have these three contestants.

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:14.246
And what better person to
decide which one of you wins

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:15.581
a chocolate factory than,

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:18.084
come on in, Gordon Ramsey, turn around.

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:19.151
- Oh my gosh. -
- No way.

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:20.920
- How's it going man?

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.821
And as you're probably guessing,

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:23.990
the final challenge is a cooking challenge

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.891
and they have 45 minutes to make a dessert

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.426
for Gordon Ramsey to judge.

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:29.495
He'll be judging on looks and taste,

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:30.563
Begin!

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:31.397
(clicking timer)

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:32.231
- Yes -
- Okay.

00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:33.432
- Don't forget a chocolate
factory's on the line.

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:35.601
I don't normally do these
cooking shows, what do we do now?

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:36.736
- So this is tough on them, by the way,

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:38.371
for the finale, they
have 45 minutes to cook.

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:39.205
That's that's,

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:40.039
- [Jimmy] That's not a lot of time?

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:40.873
- That's not a lot of time.

00:10:40.873 --> 00:10:41.807
- Oh I just made up a random number.

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:43.409
- Right, goodness how are we doing?

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:44.410
- I have no idea. I'm just,

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.244
- You have no idea?

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:46.679
- I'm looking at
ingredients and I'm trying

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:47.913
to figure out what everything is.

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:49.248
- So you've never done this recipe before?

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:50.750
- I don't know how to cook,
I'm just going for it.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.951
(Jimmy laughing)

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:52.785
- What are you working on?

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:55.187
- I need to make a cheesecake,
which I just found.

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:56.555
Probably shouldn't put that on the stove.

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:57.390
(both giggling)

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.858
- I'm starting off with a funfetti cake.

00:10:58.858 --> 00:10:59.692
- How much chocolate you putting in there?

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:01.494
- I'm gonna keep the chocolate
outta the funfetti cake.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:02.728
It's gonna come in at a later moment.

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:03.562
- A later moment?

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:05.364
We haven't got much time.
We've only got 45 minutes.

00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:06.599
- A little stressed out right now.

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:07.433
- Are you okay?

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:08.267
- I'm good. I'm good.

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:10.102
- He makes everything so
much more intense, I love it.

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:11.804
- What's the dessert?

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.305
Look at me, you've done nothing yet.

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:15.174
- There's, there's a few
different ones. So I'm gonna,

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:16.242
- A few different ones?

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:17.076
- Yes.

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:17.910
- You have 45 minutes.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:18.844
Can you work and talk at the same time?

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:19.745
- I was about to say the same thing.

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:20.913
- I probably should.

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:21.747
(all chattering)

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.082
- Honestly, I don't even know what to do.

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:25.551
Gordon just kind of took over
and it's really entertaining.

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:28.187
- Just over 20 minutes, halfway guys,

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.990
halfway to a amazing chocolate factory.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.158
- When I win this chocolate factory,

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:33.292
do you wanna buy it off of me?

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:34.694
(both laughing)

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.062
- I'm gonna see what you make first.

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:37.930
- Oh my gosh the cockiness.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.166
He decides whether or not you
win the chocolate factory.

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.367
- Oh I know, I'm aware.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.201
- Hey psst.

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.035
- Yes.

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:43.869
- Turn the gas on.

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:44.704
- I probably should.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:45.905
- Yeah, oh my God.

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:47.606
- Did you know how to
make brownies before this?

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:50.643
- Uh I have, but not with no instructions.

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:51.477
- Here we go.

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:52.311
- Lets go champ.

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:53.312
- Gotta get this in here.

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:56.849
(people laughing)

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:57.683
(torch firing)

00:11:57.683 --> 00:11:58.984
- You're burning the mat.

00:11:58.984 --> 00:11:59.819
The mat is burning.

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:00.853
- Oh shoot, you're right!

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:02.021
Just a light flame, that's
like eight inches long.

00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:03.889
- So we're, we're good
with fire extinguishers.

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:05.991
- And I don't think
marshmallows whisk like that.

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:06.792
- I don't know.

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:07.860
We're we're gonna find out though.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.694
- Oh my god.

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:09.795
- Don't come over here, Gordon.

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:11.297
- What have you done there?

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:12.131
- I don't know.

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:13.332
- It looks like you cooked it, ate it,

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.266
then threw it back up.

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:15.434
- Oh man.

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:17.369
- I think Gordon's
about to have a seizure.

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:18.537
- Two minutes.

00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:19.872
- Hey, you want me to
blow torch this for you?

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:22.041
- Uh no, not yet.

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:22.875
- All right, how about now?

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:23.709
- Not yet.

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:25.211
- Stop harassing the contestants.

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:27.279
- What Gordon's gonna want
is you to make it sound

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.714
like you put in a lot of effort.

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:31.250
So if you start using adjectives
that chefs like hearing,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.120
I put the nerds rope
here because it really

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.255
contradicts the chocolate really lets you.

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:38.657
- Shut it down, 15 seconds to go.

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:40.292
- Three

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:42.194
(crashing dishes)

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:43.162
- Oh my gosh.

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:47.600
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.801
Come on Christian.

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:51.470
Five, four, three,

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.005
two, one.

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:54.440
And stop, hands in the air.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.274
- [Jimmy] Done.

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:57.409
Gordon will now begin
judging all three dishes.

00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:58.911
He's gonna give him a score one outta 10

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:00.479
on looks and a score one outta 10,

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:01.380
based on how it tastes.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.248
Person with the highest score

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:04.016
at the end wins the chocolate factory.

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:05.117
- Justin, describe the dish.

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.519
- This is Rocky Road on a cone.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:07.853
I melted the marshmallows on top.

00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:09.421
I had a marshmallow at the
bottom 'cause I didn't know

00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:10.656
what to do at the bottom, so.

00:13:10.656 --> 00:13:11.490
(all laughing)

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:12.591
- I don't what looks worse.

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:14.193
The one at the bottom or the one on top.

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:15.027
(all laughing)

00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:17.797
So visually it looks a
little bit pedestrian.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:18.631
- I'll take that.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:19.532
- It looks like you've dropped it.

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:22.401
I'm gonna give that a
five out of 10, right?

00:13:22.401 --> 00:13:23.836
Wow.

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:25.971
How do we, does this
come with instructions?

00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:27.773
- Yeah, one honest bite.

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:30.009
(spits out bite)

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:30.810
- Oh, well.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.379
(laughing)

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:35.481
(explosive sound)

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:36.348
(loud laughing)

00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:37.283
- Five.

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:38.751
- Five. So 10 total.

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:39.585
- 10 total.

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:40.386
- All right. It's a 10 of 20.

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:41.220
So.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.188
- It looks like a bum's got
off there, what happened there?

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:45.124
- No it looked great before
and then the last minute he

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:47.693
somehow managed to ruin
his whole creation.

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:48.761
- On top I have a whipped cream.

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:50.663
That's actually melted.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:51.997
It's not there anymore.

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:54.800
And then I've got
caramelized bananas sitting

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.470
on top of coconut covered,
chocolate covered marshmallows.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.939
- Have you ever heard the word stop?

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:00.840
(Jimmy laughing)

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.241
Less is More? - I was
thinking the same thing.

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.075
- Yes.

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:03.909
- Yeah, so visually it looks a mess.

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:05.544
Three outta 10,

00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:07.546
Taste wise, what's the liquid?

00:14:07.546 --> 00:14:09.548
Why is it gone all liq.. What do you do?

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:13.519
- The syrup flooded out and
then it was, it was too much.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.854
- It's good?

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.523
- No, it's not, I know, It's not.

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:18.591
- What did you put in there?

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:20.226
I'm gonna give that a five.

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:23.062
- All right, you have
no way of winning, so.

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.430
- Thank you guys, it was a lot of fun.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.631
It was really nice to meet you.

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:26.932
- Likewise, likewise.

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:28.834
- You know, just for that,
we're gonna give him $10,000

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:30.102
for coming out.

00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:30.936
(people clapping)

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:32.404
- Thank you so much.

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:34.106
- All right, but you
lost, I'll see you later.

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:34.940
- Bye guys.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.276
- All right, so I've
created a funfetti cake,

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:40.079
chocolate river from the Willy
Wonka Factory with the boat

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:42.514
in the middle that goes
on through the waterfall.

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:44.083
Had to add a lot of color.

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:45.351
There's a lot of color in the factory.

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:47.219
- Visually. I think this looks the best.

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:48.320
- I like the story.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.689
So visually it's it's a
strong it's it's a seven.

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:51.891
- You only had 10.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.726
It's already close and
he hasn't ate it yet.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.394
- Sponge the funfetti is always better,

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:58.297
light fluffy, but I'm nervous.

00:14:58.297 --> 00:14:59.131
- Yeah?
- Uh oh.

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:00.299
- What do you think?

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.234
I can't tell if he's about
to be the worst cake ever

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:03.569
or like, oh, it was decent.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.403
- Right there.

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:05.237
- Oh my gosh.

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:06.772
- Is a seven out 10, congratulations.

00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:07.606
- Yes.

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:10.409
(all celebrating)

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:13.545
- That's it, Congratulations.

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:14.380
- Congratulations,

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.414
- Here's the deed.
- Give me this!

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:17.416
- He just won this Chocolate Factory.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:18.250
- It's all mine!

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.452
- To celebrate our launch of
milk chocolate and sea salt,

00:15:20.452 --> 00:15:22.955
we went out, we bought
10 Teslas, loads of cash,

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:25.057
and all these prizes
you see on the screen.

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:27.993
And prizes aside, unlike Hershey's,

00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:29.795
these bars only have
four to five ingredients

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.931
and just genuinely taste good.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.600
Go to feastables.com right
now and order some chocolate.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.002
Only problem is the chocolate
river is deteriorating.

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:38.470
All the candy is going bad.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.205
There's probably a million flies in there

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:42.141
and it costs a lot of money to upkeep,

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:43.142
so I'll be right back.

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:45.678
