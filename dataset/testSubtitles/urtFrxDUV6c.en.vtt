00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.101
- We are at a high school

00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:05.605
and I'm about to offer this
student $100,000 to drop out.

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.173
We worked with her mom and her teacher,

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.242
and she has no idea
we're about to interrupt

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:10.410
her summer school lessons,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.079
with a $100,000 in cash.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:13.913
- [Chris] Oh.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.216
- Let's see if she answers
the trick question correct.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.417
Hey, do you mind if we interrupt?

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.285
Have you ever heard of
the channel, MrBeast?

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.120
- I have.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.354
- Okay, this will make
this so much easier.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.423
Boys bring in the a $100,000.

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:24.257
- [Chris] Hello.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.060
- Would you drop out of high school

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.262
for $100,000 in cash?

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:32.265
(suspenseful music)

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.834
- Why not?
- Because I can still

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.070
make money going to
college and get a career.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.606
- I agree, which is why this
is actually a trick question.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.008
And if you said yes, I
wouldn't have given you money,

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:43.343
but since you said, no,

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.912
you just won $100,000.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.580
Here's $20,000

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.115
- 40,000, it's so heavy.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.083
Don't let it fall on her.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.384
- [MrBeast] Oh, don't cry.

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:54.320
- Thank you so much.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.155
- No problem.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.189
We'll just all cry.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.891
This is a Lamborghini.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.460
And Neil, if you can parallel
park this Lamborghini

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.228
between these two Teslas,

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.363
I'll let you keep it.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.397
- This is too easy, bro.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.298
- You seem pretty confident.

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:06.399
- I'm from New York,

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.734
we're raised on parallel parking.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:08.701
I don't need these anymore.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.036
- Are these the keys to your car?

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:10.870
- Yeah, man, I don't need them,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.971
I'mma drive home in this.

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.373
I got this.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.207
Here to go.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:15.175
- Oh wait Neil, wait, wait.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.242
I forgot to mention,

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.812
if this Lamborghini touches
one of these Teslas,

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.013
he loses it.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:20.947
All right, keep going.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:23.383
If he parallel parks this
Lamborghini right here,

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.217
he keeps it.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.118
This is terrifying.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.286
- I'm good right here.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.354
- You're good, you're good.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:31.357
(suspenseful music)

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:35.395
- Oh! Neil!

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.696
- Neil, do you know how expensive-

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.697
- Stop, don't hit the other car.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:38.698
Turn the car off!

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:39.532
- I don't know how!

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.367
- Neil, I think I need your car keys back,

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.103
'cause this is our next contestant.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.172
Let's see if Ivette can
parallel park a Lamborghini.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.640
Karl, can you get in and her teach her?

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.209
- That button, way over there is reverse.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.310
- This one?

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.144
There's not like a prindle?

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.046
- No, I use paddles.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.013
- Paddles?

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:54.848
- I don't know.

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:55.682
- This is gonna be awhile,

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:56.950
so we'll find out later in the video

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.118
if she wins the Lambo.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:01.754
I have over 100 different
watermelons in this field.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:04.924
And this is a check for $1 million.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.793
Ah, oh.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:07.660
- [Karl] Whoa, that was kind of perfect.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.761
- Okay, boom.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.232
There is now a check for $1
million inside this watermelon.

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:15.869
- Jay, you are surrounded
by over 100 watermelons.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.038
One of these watermelons
has a check for $1 million

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:19.873
inside of it.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.808
You get to bash one single watermelon.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.943
And if you bash the one
with $1 million in it,

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:25.011
you become a millionaire.

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:26.146
- All right, I'm gonna find it.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.580
I'm gonna find that one melon.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.382
There's big melons, there's little melons.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:31.050
There's green ones and yellow ones.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.719
- [Karl] This is sounding
like a Dr. Seuss book.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.088
- I have no idea what melon to pick here.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.090
I see some footprints next to this one,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.924
I don't know.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.726
- Jay's studying our
footprints of the sand.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:40.994
He's analyzing the stems.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.929
- Choices, choices, choices.

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.964
- Pick the watermelon you're smashing.

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.933
- No, no, no, no.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:47.901
- Get away from me,

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:48.735
I'm not a watermelon.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:49.936
- This is my million.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:50.770
- [MrBeast] That's it.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.905
- Look, it's all shiny.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.573
You're gonna make me a
millionaire, MrBeast.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:55.308
(dramatic music)

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.210
- [MrBeast] Oh, hit it.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:02:59.679
- $1000.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:00.513
- $1000

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.316
- I'll take $1000 from a watermelon.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.919
- If you would've went 10
watermelons to your right,

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:09.956
that's $1000.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:11.491
- There it is.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:14.027
- You would've saw this $1 million check.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.695
Can you confirm it says $1 million?

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.630
- That does save $1 million.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.233
- The only thing that stood
between you and $1 million,

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.467
was 10 watermelons.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:22.869
If you punch this bag,

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.771
it will rate how hard your punch was.

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.840
So naturally, I grabbed three
of the strongest men I know

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.175
and Chandler.
- Hey.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:32.912
- And whichever one of them
scores the highest gets $30,000.

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.080
- Easy money, yes!

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.882
- I say we start with the biggest guy.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.617
- I'm about the Falcon punch this thing.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.652
- Probably should have tested it.

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.454
- [MrBeast] 300, 400.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:43.256
- Oh my gosh.

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:44.691
- 902 on the dot.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.860
I would say the next
biggest person is Noah.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.062
- Come on, Noah!

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:55.802
(all screaming)

00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:59.339
- So far, the money is yours.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.940
Let's see if Sean can change that.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.141
This is Sean, my bodyguard.

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.210
Act like this is someone
trying to assault me.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.278
No, Sean saved me,

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:06.446
punch the bag.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.280
You can buy a lot with-

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.114
- Oh!

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.083
- [Announcer] Oh, that's a miss.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.117
- The score didn't go up,

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:12.619
so technically it doesn't count

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:13.920
Sean.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.688
Oh, that looks like a good hit.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:16.522
Oh, no.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:20.893
As of now, this $30,000 in cash is yours.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:23.229
The only man in the world
that can take it away from you

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.163
is Chandler.

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.331
Chandler, I know you hate pickles,

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.666
I'm gonna put it right there.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.034
Take your hit.

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:29.936
He's pulling on his crack head string.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.341
Oh wow, you scored better than Sean,

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.077
but not higher than Floyd.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:41.247
Congratulations, you just won $30,000!

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:47.153
- I punch hard, and it helped.

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:48.855
Now I can get my wisdom teeth out.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:49.922
- Back at the parking lot,

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:53.092
Ivette was really taking her
time parking this Lamborghini.

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:56.763
She literally spent over two
hours strategizing with Nolan,

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:59.532
but she does have until the end
of the day to complete this,

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.701
so we're gonna go give away
more money in the meantime.

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.903
And now we're back in
a high school classroom

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:04.971
with Mr. Hughes.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:05.805
- That's me.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:06.873
- Have a seat right here, sir.

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:08.641
- How the tables have turned.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.310
- And this is professor Chandler.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.144
- Hi.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:11.978
- This is the history book

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.212
you teach your high school students.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:14.514
- That is a textbook we use.

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:16.983
- Chandler's gonna pick a
random question from this book

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.117
and if you get it right,

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:20.586
we'll give you $10,000 in cash.

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:21.421
- Okay.

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.623
- Chandler, go ahead and
flip through the book.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:24.457
Flip.

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:25.325
The cold war.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.960
The Soviet Union views NATO as a threat.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.997
In response, the Soviets
developed an alliance system

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.334
in 1955 as a part of their
own containment policy.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.435
It was known as the?

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:36.436
- Warsaw pact.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:37.770
- Dang.
- He got it.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.240
Congratulations, you just won $10,000.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.141
Now here's the thing,

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:44.944
do you wanna risk this
$10,000 that you just won

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:46.846
for a chance at $20,000?

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:47.680
- Sure.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.482
I know this book front
and back, no problem.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:50.917
- As a teacher, he should.

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:55.188
This time, we have professor
Karl with $20,000 on the line.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.724
The Aztecs control Central Mexico.

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:01.494
What is a hard, glassy green or black rock

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.029
found in the valley of Mexico

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.398
and used to make razor sharp weapons?

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:06.232
- Obsidian.

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:07.233
- That does say obsidian,

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.970
which means he just won another $20,000.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.538
- I picked that 'cause of Minecraft.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.640
- Now obviously your cashflow
is getting pretty big.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.142
That's $20,000.

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:18.745
Do you wanna risk your
20 grand for shot at 30?

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:19.579
- We'll give it a shot.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.347
- It's time to get serious.

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:23.750
I'm gonna pick an extremely hard one.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.952
- Oh, he's really good at that!

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:29.756
- Around 520, an Italian
monk began writing a book

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:32.792
describing a strict, yet
practical set of rules

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:33.960
for monasteries.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.862
Who wrote?

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:37.397
- Benedict of Nursia.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:39.665
- Wait, he got it right?

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:40.967
- Let's go!

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:44.971
- Congratulations, you
just won 30 grand in cash.

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:47.440
I studied Benedict in
monastery for three years.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.208
- How was I supposed to know that?

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:51.677
- It pays to be a good teacher
and know your textbook.

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:53.179
- Thank you very, very much.

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.715
- This is $20,000 in cash.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:56.549
- It's real.

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:58.951
- You can split it 50 50
with a random stranger,

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:02.889
or you can steal it and walk
away with all $20,000 in cash.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:03.723
Any questions?

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:04.991
- Is there a catch?
- There's no catch.

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:06.359
- There's no catch at all?
- No catch at all.

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:07.260
- I wanna steal it then.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.594
- Okay, well that was quick.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.762
- There's no catch at all?

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.098
- Just one old man is
really sad right now.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:12.932
- Wait, what?

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.601
- The guy that lost out on 10
grands gonna be watching this.

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.170
- Wait, I'm so sorry.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.004
- What do you have to say now?

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:18.838
- I didn't know!

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:19.672
- But you did know.

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:21.307
- I thought there was gonna be catch!

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:23.543
- And boom, all $20,000.

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:24.577
All right, have a good day.

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:25.711
- You too, thanks.

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:28.214
- Would you have split the
$20,000 with someone random?

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:30.216
A person you've never
met in your entire life.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:31.217
- If thought they needed it,

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:32.051
yeah, I would have.

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:32.885
- What a nice guy,

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:33.719
now I feel kind of bad.

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:34.554
Luckily, we're gonna invite him

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:35.755
to be back in a future video,

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:36.622
so don't worry,

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:38.124
we're not completely screwing him over.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:38.958
Next bit.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.126
Don't forget to watch the end

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.662
to see if she wins this
expensive Lamborghini.

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:44.831
This is $20,000 in cash,

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:46.833
and this is a mountain of candy.

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.734
And this is Chris's son, Tucker.

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:49.769
- I made this.

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.571
- Chris, I think you see
where I'm going with this?

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:53.005
- Pick the money, boy.

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:54.540
- Put Tucker dead in the middle,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.374
right here.

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:56.209
- Okay, we've been working on this.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:58.678
Tucker step, step, step.

00:07:58.678 --> 00:07:59.712
- [MrBeast] Oh, he knows how to walk now.

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:01.647
- Go, go, go, go.

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:02.815
- This is a bunch of money.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.083
- Yeah, that's a lot of money.

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:05.618
- This is a bunch of candy.

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:06.652
Candy? Money?

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:07.487
Which one do you want?

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.488
- [Voiceover] Huh?

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.757
- Tucker, follow the money trail.

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:12.725
Woo!

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:13.759
- Two can play that game.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:16.929
- No, candy's gross.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:18.464
It's bad for your two teeth.

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:21.467
- Tucker literally didn't
move for almost 45 minutes.

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:22.835
Honestly, Tuck, if you picked the money,

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.003
I wouldn't even care at this point.

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:26.072
Just pick one or the other.

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:27.240
- He said, "okay, light."

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.774
Go, and let's go.

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:29.976
We gonna crawl, come on.

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:33.446
Peek a boo!

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:35.348
- It was never a fair
challenge to begin with.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.182
- Peek a boo!

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.016
- [MrBeast] He pulled out the peek a boo.

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:37.884
- [Chris] When does it count?

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:38.818
- I don't know.

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:42.021
He's just grabbing the lights.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:42.955
We'll just uh.

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:44.757
Oh wow!

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:45.591
He touched the money!

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.425
- [Chris] Whoa!

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:47.260
- [MrBeast] Good job, Tucker.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.694
- Also, I'm gonna give you some of this.

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.429
We're gonna take one of those lights home?

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:52.164
- Tucker, the world wants to know,

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:54.600
are you happier about the
20 grand or this light?

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:57.537
You heard it here folks.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.437
Thank you, Tuck.

00:08:58.437 --> 00:08:58.905
Next bit.

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:01.641
- It's literally like nothing
changed since we left.

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.175
- We've been doing this so long,

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:04.243
it's almost outta gas.

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:05.311
- Wait, really?

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.680
I'm gonna give you until this
Lamborghini runs outta gas.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.514
- Look at me real quick.

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:09.348
I believe in you.

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:11.350
- At least someone believes in me.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.585
Should I go?

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:13.419
- [Karl] She's going.

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:14.253
- She's gone.

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:15.087
- I'm so scared.

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:16.956
- You got this.

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:20.226
- Tiny bit more.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.060
Stop, stop, stop!

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.028
Oh my gosh.

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.397
It is less than an inch away.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.865
If you shook the car right now,

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:27.833
it would hit the Tesla.

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:29.035
- What is that, like an inch and a half?

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:30.069
Inch and a half.

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.637
She's gonna have to fully
commit to one of them.

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:33.506
- I know.
- Commit to this one,

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:35.508
and then keep readjusting.

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:36.475
- Ready?

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:37.577
- Stop, stop, stop!

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.411
No!

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.245
Did it hit?

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.079
- [Ivette] No it didn't,

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:40.913
I'm gonna cry.

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:42.014
- We think she hit the Tesla.

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:42.848
Play the clip.

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:47.320
If this piece of paper
can't fit between the cars,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.487
they're touching.

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.224
- No, no, no!

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:53.392
- They're definitely touching.

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:55.194
She didn't win the Lamborghini.

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:56.562
Can you break the news to her?

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:58.731
