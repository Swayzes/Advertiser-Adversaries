00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.340
- Every day, he survives in this room,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.260
I give him $10,000.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.600
We literally have a million
dollars in cash here.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.280
So if he survives a hundred days

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.540
he can become a millionaire.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.500
- You're gonna be poor.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.270
- At any point if you
want to end the challenge

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.770
and leave just press this red button.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.603
- Got it.

00:00:14.603 --> 00:00:15.436
- You wanna demonstrate it for us?

00:00:15.436 --> 00:00:16.710
- No, you're not gonna have it that easy.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.600
- I'm gonna dramatically seal the door.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.433
Good luck.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.630
- So this is my apartment now

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.450
but instead of paying
rent, I make $10,000 a day.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.182
This is gonna be very easy.

00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:27.015
Very easy.

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:28.962
(ominous music)

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:29.795
(upbeat music)

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:31.461
Right there. Woo.

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:32.441
Oh my God.

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:33.274
(drum beats)

00:00:33.274 --> 00:00:34.530
- Oh, it's disco time.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.650
- Stop messing with the lights, please.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.360
♪ La la la la la la la la ♪

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.850
- [Jim] Josh seems to think
that this is gonna be easy.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.130
I don't think he understands just how hard

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.294
this is gonna get.

00:00:45.294 --> 00:00:47.877
(mellow music)

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.940
- So I just woke up after
my first night sleeping here

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.890
and I'm probably just
gonna jump on the treadmill

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.300
and then eat some breakfast or something.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.133
I don't know.

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.110
(rock music)

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.240
- Hello there, Josh.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.400
It has officially been 24 hours,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.230
but I left out a key element.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.480
When I give you the $10,000 like this,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.910
you have to let me take
one item from this room.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.791
You have 10 seconds to hand me an item.

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:11.624
- 10 seconds?

00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:13.136
- Nine, eight,

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:14.709
- Three.

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:15.660
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.740
I'm gonna give you the ice cream machine.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.240
- Chris, Chandler you know what to do.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.470
Okay.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.420
- [Josh] Oh my god!

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:22.760
- Chandler!

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.208
(drum roll)

00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:25.041
(cheers)

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:25.874
- [Josh] There you go.

00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:27.240
- You just got rid of
the ice cream machine

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.730
which means you have 24
items left in this room

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.682
to get rid of.

00:01:30.682 --> 00:01:32.070
And now that we just flipped
your world upside down

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.903
I'm gonna leave.

00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:33.736
- Thanks, Jim.

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:34.770
So this genuinely changes everything.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.940
I'm actually worried about

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.230
what I'm gonna have to choose between

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.970
like family portrait or the guitar.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.770
On one hand something to keep me busy.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.630
But that's also the only
time I can see my girlfriend

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.470
is looking at that picture.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.090
I just need to be strategic with the items

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.923
that I'm giving away.

00:01:45.923 --> 00:01:47.550
Make sure I've got enough
to keep me occupied

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.587
for the long run.

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:51.570
(bright music)

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.295
- Hey, get off the computer.

00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:54.180
Take the money.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.680
- Oh, wait, why'd you throw it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.970
Give us an item, in a nice way.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.410
- This is the item that I will give you.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.490
- Do you wanna give us another item?

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.420
- What's in it for me?
- Nothing.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.526
- Then no.
- [Jim] Okay.

00:02:01.526 --> 00:02:04.680
(upbeat music)

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.360
- Here's another $10,000.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.200
I request an item.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.690
- I got a for you right here, Jimmy.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.640
- What item do you think
you'll get rid of next?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.280
- I think I'm gonna get
rid of the whiteboard next

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.563
because I can write on the walls.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:18.780
He left, didn't he?

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.550
- To make sure Josh was comfortable here

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.350
I gave him a private
chef that will cook him

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.850
literally anything he wants.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.410
- This is ridiculous.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.700
Let's try this.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.533
Oh my God.

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:29.354
This is the best thing I've ever had.

00:02:29.354 --> 00:02:32.937
(sentimental guitar music)

00:02:34.512 --> 00:02:36.000
(Carl screams)

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.890
- Add it to the pile, boys.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.710
- I'll add another 5,000 if
you let Carl pick the item.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.543
Three, two, one.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.130
- Okay fine.
- Wait, really?

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.870
- The picture of him with his sister.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.920
- Carl.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.480
- This'll look great in my living room.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.500
- I'm gonna go insane now.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.269
That's the only time I
can see my girlfriend.

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.440
- I have to go film a video on sharks.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.090
So Carl's gonna take care of you tomorrow.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.550
- Is there literally anyone
else in the universe that can

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.383
- No

00:02:57.383 --> 00:02:58.216
- So I'm in charge?

00:02:58.216 --> 00:02:59.049
- You're screwed.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.200
- That's not gonna fit in the hot tub.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.490
It's not gonna fit.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.440
- There's water everywhere.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.910
- Whoa, no, Carl.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.290
I'm getting the flame thrower, no!

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.698
- Keep the markers.

00:03:08.698 --> 00:03:12.281
(dramatic classical music)

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.254
- So I'm getting rid
of the drum set today.

00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:20.400
(heavy rock music)

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.233
Oh no.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.880
I'd say that's is a
pretty eventful morning.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.470
- Oh, you broke your drum set.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.750
This makes me wanna ask,
mentally are you okay?

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.670
- Yeah, I mean actually,
got a lot of rage out

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.050
so now I'm feeling really loose.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.883
- All right.

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:32.925
He doesn't know,

00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:34.470
but there's a check for a
hundred thousand dollars

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.490
hidden in that guitar.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.230
If he gets rid the guitar
without noticing it

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.850
that's a hundred thousand
dollars down, shh.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.530
Josh's room was getting pretty messy.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.990
So I paid a cleaning crew to
come in and take care of it

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.910
and he somehow slept through all of it.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.100
It has officially been
eight days in this room

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.881
and for whatever reason,
he's asleep at 6:00 PM.

00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:50.730
- Probably 'cause he's bored.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.280
- Good morning, Josh. Even though 6:00 PM.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.810
- Here's another 10 grand in cash.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.997
What's the item for today?

00:03:55.997 --> 00:03:56.830
- The flame thrower.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.020
- All right, the flame thrower is gone.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.580
We totally don't have
anything else planned

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.413
while we're here.

00:04:00.413 --> 00:04:01.246
- Jimmy, what about?

00:04:01.246 --> 00:04:02.160
- That's it, don't give
it away, Christopher.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.849
- That didn't seem
suspicious at all, for sure.

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:05.790
(angelic music)

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.860
- Wait, why is my face so distorted?

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.150
I'm gonna hand it off to Chris

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.100
and you know how dumb he can get.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.930
- I am your god.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.810
- Chris, do you have to
be so close to the mic?

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.160
Show me the outside world.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.530
- You can't see anything
except for like the black sky.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.880
- Is it dark outside already?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.795
- Yeah.

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:22.920
- I've really lost all concept of time.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.330
- All right Jimmy, I'm gonna come get you.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.580
- What's that over there?

00:04:26.423 --> 00:04:29.006
(guitar music)

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.970
If Nolan spends the next 24 hours with you

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.890
I'll give you an extra 10 grand today.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:35.760
- Do I get money too?

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.612
- No, just him.

00:04:36.612 --> 00:04:37.445
- So I just have to stay in here?

00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:38.400
- Ready to start the challenge?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.233
- Yeah, we're chillin', let's do it.

00:04:39.233 --> 00:04:41.269
- One, two, three, four.

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:43.140
(upbeat music)

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.640
- You shouldn't have
gotten rid of the drums.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.703
- I know, dude.

00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:48.525
(upbeat music)

00:04:48.525 --> 00:04:51.660
(Hip Hop music)

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.310
- All right, I'm done. I'm going home.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.450
- Nolan, you're not leaving.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.283
- I am leaving.

00:04:55.283 --> 00:04:56.116
- No, no, no, no.

00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:57.120
- I'm pressing the button.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.792
Okay, it has a little bit
of battery left on it.

00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:00.630
(upbeat music)

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.463
- It's you.

00:05:01.463 --> 00:05:02.731
- Chill!

00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:05.790
- I can't take it anymore,
they won't open the doors.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.530
Are you kidding? There's another wall.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.363
Dunk contest.

00:05:08.363 --> 00:05:09.644
- All right, let's go.

00:05:09.644 --> 00:05:11.793
Yes.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.153
- Just two dudes in a hot tub.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.870
- Boys, there's another digit.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.800
- Do you even know what that means?

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.957
- No.

00:05:20.957 --> 00:05:21.790
- Can I just say whatever I want

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.623
and you guys just don't question it?

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:23.456
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.400
- To celebrate 10 days
we had a custom $10,000,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.080
five foot cake made for you.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.130
- Oh my God.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.593
- Guys, guys, guys.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.393
- I don't know what to do.

00:05:32.393 --> 00:05:34.255
I'm just gonna stand
back and let this happen.

00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:35.280
- What do you mean let it happen?

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.113
- Eat it.

00:05:36.113 --> 00:05:37.510
- Oh my God, it's incredible.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.540
- Even though the cake is a mess

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.980
there's some of our Feastables bars on it.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.810
Just go to feastables.com,
they taste amazing.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.980
- It's so much better than the cake.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.630
- Enjoy your $10,000 cake.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.740
- Bye Jimmy.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.010
As of today, I am now at $115,000

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.452
thanks to the extra 10 grand
for Nolan staying here.

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:54.780
(upbeat music)

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.613
- What up Josh?

00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:56.940
Sorry I couldn't be there today.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.680
I'm out of town filming a different video

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.810
but we still gotta give you your 10 grand.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.800
Do it.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.210
- Oh my God.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.530
- Throw an item outside the door.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.523
- Here we go, boys.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.703
- Mission complete.

00:06:07.703 --> 00:06:09.150
Josh is getting super lonely.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.200
Every time I talk to him,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.240
he mentions how much he
misses his girlfriend.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.790
Every day we've been grabbing
a briefcase from this pile

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.200
and look how much it's shrunk.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.033
Would you rather,

00:06:17.033 --> 00:06:19.410
I deliver you another
10 grand in a briefcase

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.300
or your girlfriend delivers it

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.650
but it only has five grand in it.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.483
- Is she here?

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:24.599
- Yeah, right outside.

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:25.432
- Oh yeah, five grand. I don't care.

00:06:25.432 --> 00:06:28.440
- As I promised you simp,
here's your girlfriend.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.760
- Oh my God.
- Hey.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.550
- Put that down, I don't care.
- Here's your money.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.810
- They look so happy.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.180
He's gone 12 days without
seeing his girlfriend.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.713
- Been the longest that we've gone

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:39.090
without seeing each other

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.220
in our entire six year relationship.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.010
- Also, I forgot to mention
that you only have 10 minutes

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.440
and it's been like three, so
you have like seven minutes?

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.273
- No.
- Ah.

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:48.300
- I feel like as long as I know

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.590
that you're doing okay out there,

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.790
I'm gonna be doing fine in here.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.220
It's kind of like surreal that
you're even here right now.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.880
- I hate to ruin the moment
but the 10 minute timer is up.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.320
- No!

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.700
- I'm deaf now.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.927
Love you, bye.

00:07:00.927 --> 00:07:03.330
- Ah, I don't know if
this helped or hurted me.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.170
I hurt.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.620
- [Jim] On day 13 Josh
reminded me of a $10,000 bet

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.460
he made with Chandler.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.770
- I'll bet you 10 grand
I go longer than 10 days.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.603
- All right, deal.

00:07:11.603 --> 00:07:14.370
- I'll bet you 10 more
of Jimmy's thousands.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.900
- How about, I don't
care what he's saying?

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.100
Take this, no more bets.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.100
- I actually want you
guys to take this 20 grand

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.390
and I want you to buy a ring with it

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.890
because I'm gonna propose to my girlfriend

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.880
at the end of this video.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.713
- Oh wow.

00:07:24.713 --> 00:07:27.000
- Are you sure you trust these
hooligans to buy you a ring?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.460
- I don't, but I have no other choice.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.293
On a real note though,

00:07:30.293 --> 00:07:32.370
I have been wanting to propose
to Kenna for years now.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.720
Being trapped in here has made me realize

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.010
how valuable time is.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.940
I'm just done waiting.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.670
- [Jim] So the audio might
have gotten messed up here.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.380
- We're at the local diamond shop.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.280
- [Jim] But Chris and Chandler

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.690
still made a deal with the jeweler

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.180
and found the exact ring
that Josh was looking for.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.735
- Yay Josh.

00:07:46.735 --> 00:07:47.880
We're back.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.440
- So this is your first time ever

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.400
seeing your wedding ring.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.513
- Yeah, this is crazy.

00:07:53.103 --> 00:07:56.160
- Yo, that's insane.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.320
Bits aside, this is exactly what I wanted.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.450
I literally can't stop
looking at this ring

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.340
but to be honest it's
making me want to get out

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.173
more than anything.

00:08:03.173 --> 00:08:04.590
Every day I spend in here

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.960
it's like I'm holding myself
back from being engaged.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.630
- [Jim] Josh has now made $160,000

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.520
and been inside of this
room for two weeks.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.290
And I was out of town on day 15

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.080
so I had to FaceTime Josh
with a special guest.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.913
- Hey buddy.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.090
- Is that Jake Paul?

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.785
- You're just winning at life.

00:08:19.785 --> 00:08:22.140
(classical music)

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.087
- A perfect centerpiece to my room.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:26.730
The recliner's gone, I'm
now down to nine items

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.950
and I have no clue what
I'm gonna give up next.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.720
I don't look stupid playing VR.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.940
You look stupid playing VR.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.500
Oh my God. Oh no.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.705
Oh no.

00:08:35.705 --> 00:08:36.538
No.

00:08:36.538 --> 00:08:37.920
It's gonna be the treadmill.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.770
Nolan's here to hang out.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.994
- What was that?

00:08:41.994 --> 00:08:42.827
Ah.

00:08:42.827 --> 00:08:44.440
Whoa.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.340
Ow, what is that?

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.160
- Maybe this is cheering
me up a little bit.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.100
Knowing that I could leave
right now with 190 grand

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.630
is making it incredibly difficult.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.450
It's honestly like the lack of fresh air.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.530
I feel sick.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.700
The doctor checked me out today.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.380
My throat's like kind of messed up.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.870
Slightly considered the
possibility of pushing the button.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.280
- Boohoo, I'm Josh.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.200
I'm making hundreds of
thousands of dollars

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.580
to lay in a room and do nothing.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.519
- Okay. Are you mocking me right now?

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:08.352
- No, no, no no. Here's your 10 grand.

00:09:08.352 --> 00:09:09.185
What's the item?

00:09:09.185 --> 00:09:10.018
It's gonna be the VR.

00:09:10.018 --> 00:09:10.851
- Then what are you gonna do tomorrow?

00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:11.940
- Play guitar I guess.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.960
- You sound defeated.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.130
- A lot of you guys are probably like,

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.450
oh this would be a cakewalk,

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.283
it's the easiest thing ever.

00:09:16.283 --> 00:09:18.116
But it's something you truly
won't understand until you--

00:09:18.116 --> 00:09:18.949
- You know what? You're right.

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:20.097
It's very hard, you should just leave.

00:09:20.097 --> 00:09:21.630
- No, I can't.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.680
- Hello Josh.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.520
- What's going on?

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.372
- Is he wearing his
clothes on the hot tub?

00:09:25.372 --> 00:09:26.907
Buddy, how you doing?

00:09:26.907 --> 00:09:29.700
- I'm just existing right now.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.320
- Just existing in the hot tub.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.210
The item he's getting
rid of is the hot tub.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.043
- Mm-hmm.

00:09:34.043 --> 00:09:34.876
- You're in charge of removing it.

00:09:34.876 --> 00:09:36.180
Turn on the lights.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.013
- Here we go.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.090
- I don't think it'll fit.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.870
- Wouldn't it just be easier to drain

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.250
and disassemble the hot tub in the room?

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.140
- Wouldn't it be easier
to worry about yourself?

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.006
- That's fair.

00:09:47.006 --> 00:09:47.850
(saw whirring)

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.130
I think I can ram the forklift into it

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:50.963
and it'll just fall.

00:09:50.963 --> 00:09:52.170
- Oh no.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.085
Oh my God.

00:09:54.085 --> 00:09:54.918
Oh my god.

00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:56.670
- Honestly, Jim this is the
most excitement I've had

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.000
the whole time I've been here.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.833
- This is actually very entertaining.

00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:00.213
Just watching him being idiot.

00:10:01.243 --> 00:10:03.134
- Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop.

00:10:03.134 --> 00:10:04.440
- Oh my God, my room.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.421
- Oh no, I'm getting the rug pulled on me.

00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:07.653
- What is going on?

00:10:07.653 --> 00:10:08.515
(horn honks)

00:10:08.515 --> 00:10:10.114
- Oh God, oh God.

00:10:10.114 --> 00:10:12.570
- Okay, oh he made it.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.412
- How is this going well right now?

00:10:14.412 --> 00:10:16.576
(wood cracks)

00:10:16.576 --> 00:10:17.409
- Am I going through the floor?

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:18.270
- You're about to.

00:10:19.488 --> 00:10:20.843
- Oh my God, get it out, go.

00:10:20.843 --> 00:10:22.208
(Chris screams)

00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:23.242
Oh my god, the floor.

00:10:23.242 --> 00:10:24.494
(Chris screams)

00:10:24.494 --> 00:10:25.847
Oh my god.

00:10:25.847 --> 00:10:26.909
- He got it out.

00:10:26.909 --> 00:10:28.380
- Let's go.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.750
- [Jim] Oh yeah, oh.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.670
And that concludes Chris being an idiot.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.770
Here's what things look like
at the start of the video.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.570
And here's what things look like now.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.090
I think the forklift tire
marks really add character.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.560
- I mean, look at this place.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.194
I feel like I'm living
in a construction zone.

00:10:42.194 --> 00:10:44.340
(upbeat music)

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.590
Oh my God I forgot about
all the water jugs.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.570
Early on, I had to fill my
hot tub up with more water

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.857
'cause it was getting low
and I threw these up here.

00:10:49.857 --> 00:10:51.586
Can you gimme the stars?

00:10:51.586 --> 00:10:54.660
(mellow music)

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.653
- Lights on.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.200
What up, Josh? Josh?

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.130
- I'm up here, Jim?

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.780
- Here's your 10 grand for the day.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.800
What item are you giving up?

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.540
- I think it's gonna be
the pool table today.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.280
Jimmy, can you let me down first?

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.270
Jimmy no.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.293
I don't want to be here anymore.

00:11:07.293 --> 00:11:09.060
- Then leave. I just made you rich.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.140
- Yeah, I know, thanks Jim.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.700
Hey, on a real note, you're the best.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.533
- I love you.

00:11:12.533 --> 00:11:13.980
Speaking of love, I
talked to your girlfriend

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.240
and she said, she misses you a lot.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.830
- Bro.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.120
- That's enough human interaction.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.050
If you survive the night

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.000
we'll bring a ladder in the morning.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.378
- I miss everything outside of this dome.

00:11:23.378 --> 00:11:25.961
(guitar music)

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.560
I just keep thinking about Kenna.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.510
- [Jim] I think Josh is
getting sick of people

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.833
watching him all the time.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.970
- Let's go.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.090
Nope.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.290
Oh no.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.130
- What are you getting rid of?

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:47.970
- Basketball.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.094
- Say no more.

00:11:49.094 --> 00:11:50.370
- Oh my god.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.260
- Honestly now the most
exciting part of my day

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.910
is them taking my items.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.610
- All he has left to live
off of is this guitar

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.710
and this bed, and 230 grand.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.310
- It's less depressing when
you add that at the end.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.710
Because I kept the whole bed together

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:05.850
I only have the guitar

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.512
and now I need to start sacrificing sleep.

00:12:08.512 --> 00:12:11.056
(dramatic music)

00:12:11.056 --> 00:12:13.260
(string twangs)

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.610
That's it, that's the last straw.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.380
I just broke the string on the one thing

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.970
that was remotely keeping me insane.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:18.803
Keeping me sane.

00:12:18.803 --> 00:12:19.782
I can't even talk.

00:12:19.782 --> 00:12:22.532
(dramatic music)

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:26.133
Woo. Oh, that felt good.

00:12:28.277 --> 00:12:29.110
What is this?

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.390
(guitar music)

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.738
What? Is this a check for a hundred grand?

00:12:33.738 --> 00:12:36.120
Woo. Let's go.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.953
- What's up Josh?

00:12:36.953 --> 00:12:38.820
- Look what I found, Jimmy.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.990
- Why'd you smash it?

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.130
- There's my item.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.607
11 briefcases for today.

00:12:42.607 --> 00:12:44.130
- There you go.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.350
- Beautiful. Jimmy, it's time.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.183
Go get Kenna.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:48.120
- You want me to go get your girlfriend?

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.953
- Right now.

00:12:48.953 --> 00:12:49.786
- Are you sure?

00:12:49.786 --> 00:12:51.720
- I am 100% sure.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.950
- You don't want to stay in this room?

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.420
- I made 340 grand, I'm done.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.958
I'm good. We're doing this thing now.

00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:56.791
- Okay.

00:12:56.791 --> 00:12:57.624
- And I'm leaving.

00:12:57.624 --> 00:12:59.940
- Enjoy the last few
moments before he gets out.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.680
- I just want to talk for a minute.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.513
Like on a real note,

00:13:02.513 --> 00:13:03.780
spending this time apart from you

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.640
has made me realize even more

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.821
just how much I love you and need you.

00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:08.940
- He's about to do it.
He's about to do it.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.680
- I wanna spend the
rest of my life with you

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.177
and I want to grow old with you.

00:13:12.177 --> 00:13:13.710
And I need to ask you a question.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.799
- Oh my God.

00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:16.142
- Will you marry me?

00:13:16.142 --> 00:13:17.142
- Yes, yes.

00:13:21.245 --> 00:13:22.078
- Oh!

00:13:22.078 --> 00:13:23.166
(Kenna laughs)

00:13:23.166 --> 00:13:24.415
(Josh laughs)

00:13:24.415 --> 00:13:26.280
- They tripped over the
money they just won.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.191
- [Jim] And on top of that,
we brought your family out.

00:13:29.191 --> 00:13:30.136
- Oh my god.

00:13:30.136 --> 00:13:32.719
(upbeat music)

00:13:34.348 --> 00:13:36.848
- Okay, let's take a step out.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.613
- Let's go.

00:13:38.613 --> 00:13:40.470
- You're gonna make me cry, Josh.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.840
- If you haven't already,
subscribe. Goodbye.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.610
Someone random that
subscribes to this channel

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.490
in the next seven days will
receive $10,000 in cash.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.110
That's right guys, we're
closing in on my dream

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.520
of 100 million subscribers

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.510
and I really wanna hit it.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.740
It would mean the world to me.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.030
So subscribe if you haven't already

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.220
because you could win $10,000 in cash.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.713
- Woo, fresh air baby.
