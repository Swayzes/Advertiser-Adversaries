00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.837
When I casually dropped the bombshell recently

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:07.974
that we're building a LAN gaming center.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:11.211
Y'all understandably were like, what?

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.046
I have so many questions.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.182
So I brought Chase and Dan out here

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.617
to get you guys the answers.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:18.918
I can't wait to give you guys a tour

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.487
because there is so much going on in here.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.321
Let's go.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.656
We've got two units,

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:26.393
each of which is about 18,000 square feet.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.661
And as you can see, they're brand new,

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.563
which comes with some drawbacks.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:34.901
Things as simple as toilets and walls are BYO.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.570
But it also means that no one else's junk

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.006
is in the way of us executing on our vision

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.143
of the ultimate LAN center.

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:44.944
There will still be some challenges.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:47.480
We'll be sharing the parking allocation for this complex

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.650
with at least a dozen other tenants.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.920
So, hey guys, do you mind if we use some of the spots

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.754
on the weekends?

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.956
Cool, but there's lots of other great stuff

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.458
about this building.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.526
It's even got water.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.493
Wow, water.

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.196
Look, there's even an area where you can touch grass.

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.365
You can fit so much power in this bad boy.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.634
Speaking of power, that's one of the biggest challenges

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:08.835
when you're hosting a LAN event.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.137
How many people are we trying to connect to this thing?

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:14.040
We're trying to fit 250 to 300 people in here

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.042
and we want to do multiple Whale LANs a year.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.410
Whale LAN.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.112
We're gonna show you guys exactly how we're gonna do it

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.114
after the segue to our sponsor.

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:22.282
Build Redux.

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:24.884
You can build your dream gaming rig with Build Redux.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.853
You can customize your build any way you want

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:28.922
and let Build Redux do the heavy lifting

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.356
all at a price that's competitive

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.092
with building a PC yourself.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.327
Check out Build Redux at the link down below.

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:35.161
Tour time.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.729
Right now, we're standing in what's going to be

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.632
a closed off LAN equipment storage area

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:41.901
because under normal circumstances,

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.703
this is going to be a badminton center.

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:46.606
So the idea is everything we need to host a LAN

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:51.611
is on pallets and wrapped or on racking inside this area.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:56.182
And what's our goal for roll out and unroll out?

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.251
We basically just want to roll out the entire LAN

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.520
in like a single day, set up all the tables,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.255
set up all the power, all the networking,

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.756
and then roll it back into this area

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.291
so that we can be back to playing badminton

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.326
as fast as possible.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.393
Freaking awesome.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.696
But that means that there's some stuff

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.364
that we have to hardwire into the building.

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:13.333
So from the panel over here,

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.369
we're gonna be using these twist and lock power connectors.

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.205
They're called CS6369 connectors.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:22.041
And then each of those is gonna be positioned,

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.410
what I think it was about 20 feet apart

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.411
all the way down the building.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:29.048
Yeah, and each receptacle is gonna be 50 amp and 240 volt.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.683
So we plug into a distribution box

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.318
and then that runs out to each lane

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.853
so we can power everyone's computer,

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:35.155
hopefully without an issue.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.923
So then this side is gonna be check-in,

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.158
it's gonna be our stage,

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.727
it's gonna be kind of like console or retro areas.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:42.962
If we have any other booths or activations,

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:44.764
everything's gonna run along here.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:47.300
That way you can kind of split the whole room.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.701
For the console area,

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.637
we could steal my old projector setup.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:51.471
Yeah.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:52.739
We'll have full lighting control in here.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.375
We're gonna just completely cover over all the windows

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.577
because you don't want any light for badminton

00:02:57.577 --> 00:03:00.013
and you especially don't want any light for a LAN party.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.582
So man, we could have like,

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.817
even like a couple projector walls

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.519
for people to play Smash or whatever.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.353
Yeah, for sure.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:08.655
I mean, if you look at this wall over here,

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.557
there's actually just these huge blank gaps.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.158
That's perfect for projectors

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:13.960
and anything else you wanna throw up on the-

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.395
About that, bad news.

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.531
That wall is gonna be kind of an ugly color for badminton.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.999
What color is it gonna be?

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.034
Green or blue.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.569
Okay, well, we'll definitely just have to use

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.403
the other wall then.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.038
Yeah, that wall is gonna be the same color.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:25.872
Oh, okay.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.040
For the same reason.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.974
I guess we're gonna have to invest

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:28.942
in some projector screens.

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:29.776
Yeah, don't worry.

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:30.577
We've got a couple.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:31.511
Okay, okay.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.412
Enough power though.

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:33.913
We brought Dan here for a reason.

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.248
Let's talk about networking.

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:36.482
But to get there,

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:40.119
we're gonna have to kind of traverse the badminton area.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:42.222
Where's the slots going, Linus?

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.356
Slots, you say?

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.091
Well, officially we aren't gonna have any,

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.793
but Chase, I think you were saying

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.695
we could put arcade machines along this wall?

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:49.896
Yeah, we could have a row here

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.598
or in this little corner right here.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:53.967
So we have a lot of room for a lot of activities.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.002
We don't have arcade machines.

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:57.370
We will figure something out.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.271
I see.

00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:00.206
Here on our way up, I'll give you the lay of the land.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.475
This double door is gonna be staff only

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:06.012
and completely closed off during LAN events for security.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:10.316
This is going to be the entrance, service area,

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.819
and pro shop for the badminton center.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.820
This right here is gonna be

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.056
the world's most expensive hallway between the pro shop

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:19.492
and what will be the concession change room area.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:21.961
And that's because these two units

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.696
were not really designed to be combined.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.733
So there's a giant support beam here.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.234
Ah, the reason I bring this up though

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:29.802
is under these stairwells,

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:31.971
there's gonna be a couple of little Harry Potter closets.

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:34.040
One of which is going to be a network closet

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.010
that is connected to, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.444
I'm not gonna run all the way there now.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.413
It's quite far, which is the reason

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:41.981
that we need this little closet

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:45.418
because otherwise some of the lines along this wall

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:46.653
would have been too long.

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:48.821
Ethernet can only do about a hundred meters

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.523
before you start running into trouble.

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:54.127
On this side, this is gonna be all badminton all the time.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.895
Although who knows if Wayland gets huge,

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:57.363
maybe we'll wire it up for power

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.431
or networking at some point.

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.700
It's gonna have badminton specific lighting though,

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.369
special HVAC so that there aren't air currents

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:05.204
within the space, all kinds of cool stuff.

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:07.206
Then over here, we're gonna have our change rooms

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:08.441
and our concession area.

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.644
So men's change room, little utility area

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:14.080
with a sink and washer dryer, that kind of stuff.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.682
Women's change room.

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.817
Naturally, this is the women's with the natural light.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.585
They always get the nicer bathrooms.

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.120
This is gonna be a little concession area.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.755
We're hoping to have like, you know,

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:25.325
muffins, coffee, bubble tea, that sort of thing.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:29.195
And then this is the stairwell that I was hoping to take up

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.197
and it's on the ground.

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:32.231
That's okay, we'll take the other one.

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:33.399
Hopefully that'll be fine.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:34.701
This is to code, right?

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:36.502
Seems like it.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:37.337
Here we are.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.205
We're gonna have a little office space right here

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:42.875
and a network closet that I am deeply worried about this.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:43.976
We're supposed to have one of those

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.813
big floor standing Eaton UPS units in here.

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:49.315
Wanna run us through what we're gonna have in here?

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:50.483
Well, I mean, we've got our UPS,

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:51.751
we've got our full-size rack,

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:53.553
we've got our switching infrastructure

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:56.689
for like the 300 individual ethernet runs.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.958
We don't need 300 individual runs, do we?

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.927
Yeah, I mean, this place is massive.

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:03.363
We're getting all ethernet down the sides here.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.698
We've got the fiber runs, we've got ethernet runs

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:08.101
for all of the ethernet connected speakers.

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.937
We've got all our visa machines downstairs.

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:11.871
All the cameras.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:12.839
All the cameras.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.340
Taking security very seriously.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.808
All of the door access.

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.343
Chase, do you have the plans?

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:18.311
Yeah, I do.

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:20.246
So this is the server room

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:21.814
and then the office right next to it.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:25.118
So I don't know, this looks like it's right.

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:25.952
Yeah, that's right.

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:27.920
I think it was bigger at some point.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.921
It's tall.

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.957
We could just put them on top of each other.

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:32.992
Like bunk beds, the servers.

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:33.993
I like that idea.

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.161
That's a good idea.

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:36.396
Linus does not seem amused.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.030
Oh, okay.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.365
How did this happen?

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.567
I mean, that's about 19 inches.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.735
This could be our rack.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.437
This is gonna be just like the one

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:47.006
under the stupid office stairs.

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:49.041
There's enough room, it'll be fine.

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.710
Well, we're gonna get that resolved,

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.646
but one way or another, about every 10 feet,

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:56.382
so twice as many drops as the power drops,

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:59.819
we're gonna have both ethernet and fiber.

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.155
In a perfect world, we're gonna use the fiber

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:04.757
and we're gonna have 25 gig going

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:06.759
to each row of computers.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.327
So that would mean everyone gets

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:10.930
a full dedicated gigabit uplink

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.333
to what is not going to be the fastest internet ever,

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:17.637
but given that we're gonna have a Steam cache in here

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:20.940
that will also handle caching Windows updates

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.809
and all that other kind of cool stuff,

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.211
should be more than enough speed

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:27.780
for anything you guys would wanna do while you're here.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.249
And then, because fiber's fragile

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:33.386
and this is gonna be a badminton center 98% of the time,

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:34.754
in case that gets damaged,

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:37.056
we're gonna have Cat 6A dropping down

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:38.458
to each of those spots as well

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.928
and the capability of having a 10 gig copper uplink

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:43.863
in case we need to.

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:45.064
It's like, you might have to slum it

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:47.600
with 500 megabit to your desk,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.769
assuming everyone is hitting it at the same time.

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.070
I think you'll be all right.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.039
Is this the bathroom up here, Dan?

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.209
I think so, considering there's a toilet hole

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.677
and another thing there.

00:07:57.677 --> 00:08:00.446
Wasn't 100% sure if it was a toilet hole.

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.914
It does look like a toilet hole, though.

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:03.783
I mean, any hole's a toilet hole.

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:05.718
This is gonna be a kitchenette,

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:09.922
with the idea being that if we turn this

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:13.693
into a member's lounge or turn it into more gaming area

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:16.762
during LANs, you'd be able to, you know,

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:19.732
microwave some pizza pops or whatever the case may be

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:22.768
and then over here through this door is gonna be a gym.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:24.570
Nothing heavy, we're not gonna have

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.806
like massive weight machines or anything like that.

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:29.909
I'm talking some treadmills and other cardio stuff,

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:32.979
maybe some medicine balls, that sort of thing

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:35.348
and then it'll also be an observation area

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.782
where you can kinda, you know,

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:39.018
your kid's got badminton lessons or something,

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:41.654
you can stand on the treadmill, watch the lesson.

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:44.957
Everything's kind of in flux right now, though.

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:48.394
It could change, just like, you know,

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:51.731
we changed this having stairs, ha ha.

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:54.333
In all seriousness, these stairs will come back.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.936
The original plan was actually to have them go

00:08:56.936 --> 00:09:00.573
down a little bit, across and then up to the other side

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:03.075
but there was a reason we couldn't do that.

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:04.277
I forget what it is.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:05.711
So now we have this door.

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:07.914
Hey, I found the toilet for your toilet holes.

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:10.449
Oh, perfect, it makes a good stand, honestly.

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:13.719
Yeah, for the backpack from lttstore.com.

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:14.554
Hey, nice.

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:17.857
Why did you put yours on the bowl?

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:18.858
You said it wasn't used.

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:21.260
We should talk about how the PA system's gonna work.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.094
That's right.

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:25.464
Man, there's nothing that makes me more angry

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:26.732
than a PA system that...

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:31.170
Could the owner of a [inaudible]

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.605
Whose lights are on?

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:33.773
I don't know.

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:36.943
So I tasked Dan, who actually has a ton of experience

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:38.978
in audio, with coming up with a PA system

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:41.914
that's gonna not suck and we ended up with...

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:43.382
It's a full Dante integration

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:46.485
with ethernet connected POE speakers pretty much everywhere.

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:49.055
Honestly, seeing this place for the first time today

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:51.924
I'm a little concerned, but I think it'll be fine.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.359
Oh good, that's always a good sign.

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:55.595
Thankfully, one of the controllers that we got

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:58.831
for this has some really powerful echo rejection as well

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.333
cause we're gonna have wireless microphones

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:01.200
and things like that.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.001
Yes.

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:03.402
Some of the major issues with having microphones

00:10:03.402 --> 00:10:05.671
in a giant echo chamber like this

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:08.474
is the speakers feeding back into the microphones.

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:10.476
However, one thing that's gonna help is,

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:12.411
you know how we always spray the ceilings

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:13.279
in our buildings?

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.080
You're gonna do that?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.214
We're gonna do it here as well.

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:18.150
Because as much as I love the sound of like,

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:21.921
I actually hate that sound.

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:24.957
I also hate being standing on the opposite side of the court

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:26.859
and not being able to hear what the other person's saying

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:28.294
because of all the standing waves.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.161
Of course.

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:30.062
So yeah, we're gonna spray it.

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:31.497
And then in the longterm,

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:34.000
we'd like to also get some giant panels

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.801
and just kind of plunk them on the wall

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.003
every once in a while as well.

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:37.870
That'll be great.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.339
Yeah, we're gonna do some hanging speakers up there.

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:43.109
All of the speakers are gonna be along the walls as well.

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:44.677
In here, we're gonna do them everywhere.

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:46.112
How many speakers are we gonna have?

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:48.914
I think it's like 40 or something.

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:52.018
It's a lot, but I mean, the place is giant, right?

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:54.787
There's really only one or two in here.

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.255
The nice thing about doing Dante

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:58.457
is for the microphones and things like that,

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:00.693
any ethernet jack in the building,

00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:03.262
you can just plug them in and you're good to go.

00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:05.464
All of which is obviously gonna be great for LANs,

00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:06.799
but also good for badminton.

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:08.200
We wanna run tournaments here.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.735
And when you're calling people to their court,

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:11.237
it's nice to be able to actually hear them,

00:11:11.237 --> 00:11:12.872
especially if you're in the change room

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:13.839
or something like that.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:18.010
And in the longterm, we have very big dreams

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.880
for what we could do technologically here for badminton.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.082
We're gonna have cameras on every court

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:24.016
right out of the gate.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.218
So if you're running a tournament or something like that,

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:28.821
you can just send a Twitch link to your parents

00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:32.058
and they can watch or cool stuff like that for the kids.

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:33.592
And then in the longterm,

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:35.294
we'd love to use those cameras

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:37.196
to have a little instant replay.

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:39.131
You see these trenches on the floors?

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:41.834
Each of these is gonna carry power and networking

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:46.072
from the wall to the center between each court.

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:49.241
And the idea is that we could run anything here,

00:11:49.241 --> 00:11:52.378
but in the shortterm, the plan is to have TVs.

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:55.681
One here, one here, one here, one here.

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:58.217
So then on each court, after each point,

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:00.453
the camera says, okay, hey, the shuttle touched the floor,

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:02.088
use machine vision for that.

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:05.224
And then it'll play back the last three or four seconds

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:06.759
so that you don't have any disputes

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:09.762
about line calls, for example.

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:13.199
I would love to automate scorekeeping in the very longterm,

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:17.036
but that's gonna take some serious work

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.871
and maybe a bigger network closet

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:21.073
for all the GPUs that would have to power it.

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:24.610
Bunk beds.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.978
We're not doing bunk beds, Dan.

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:27.179
We're doing bunk beds.

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.015
Now we'll be fine.

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:32.985
I mean, we've got the Camino, which has six 4090s in it.

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:33.819
That'll fit in there.

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.254
They're gonna need that back.

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:37.523
Since we're here,

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:39.792
did you guys have any other questions or concerns?

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:42.061
Yeah, are we gonna be covering up all of these windows,

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:44.396
especially the ones on the roof and the sides?

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:46.932
All the windows are going to be blacked out.

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:47.767
Okay, perfect.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.002
Yeah, we want perfect light control in here for badminton.

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:52.872
And then for a LAN, in the longer term,

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:55.307
I'd love to have two sets of lights,

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:57.977
visible lights and then black lights.

00:12:57.977 --> 00:12:59.578
So we could just turn the whole place

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:02.114
like rave style, all black light.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:02.982
I think that'd be super cool.

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:03.783
That would be a ton of fun.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.050
You could get those ones that blind people?

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.585
No, no.

00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:09.421
We get the ones where we'd have like UV reactive paint

00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:11.290
and then we'd put some stuff on the walls.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.225
That only shows up when you're hosting the LAN.

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.661
Sign the wall kind of thing and UV light?

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:18.264
For middle of the night stuff.

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:19.899
There's no reason we couldn't bring some stuff

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:21.000
from LTX, right?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.868
Yeah, we could bring anything that we still have

00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:24.036
from LTX back here.

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:27.072
So like the RC cars, the retro corner,

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.107
any of those kinds of booths.

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:29.775
If we still have some of the stuff kicking around-

00:13:29.775 --> 00:13:31.410
How fun would that be?

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.278
Okay.

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:33.078
It would depend though.

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:35.080
The RC cars, would we be playing badminton

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.149
on the weekends on that side of the building?

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:39.051
During the day, certainly.

00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:41.220
But whether it would be happening at night

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.823
depends on whether we have 24 seven access

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.424
for badminton club members.

00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:46.258
Got it.

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:47.459
And that's TBD right now.

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:50.296
So almost certainly we won't at the very beginning.

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:52.531
So I see no reason why we couldn't open up those doors

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:55.634
at night and just like go hog wild over there.

00:13:55.634 --> 00:13:57.002
Yeah, I mean, it gives us a ton of space

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:59.772
to just do some fun activations if we have anything

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:01.307
that needs a little bit more room.

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:04.443
And I think I did pretty okay with the speaker placements.

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:06.545
There's going to be a center one just above you.

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:09.281
And then of course kind of dotted around with all the walls.

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:11.584
And if you treat it, then I think this will be okay.

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:14.119
Right now it definitely needs it.

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.187
Oh yeah.

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:16.021
Oh yeah.

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:17.656
I want to convolution this so I can capture it.

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:19.158
It's a beautiful reverb.

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:23.295
Horrendous.

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:24.263
Yeah.

00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:25.097
Send me that.

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:25.898
And while you're at it,

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:28.434
maybe send him this message from our sponsor.

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:29.735
Squarespace.

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:32.338
Creating your own website shouldn't be difficult.

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:34.773
Luckily with Squarespace, it's not.

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:36.575
Their all-in-one platform makes it easy

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:38.878
to get your website up and running quickly.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.313
Just start with their fluid engine site builder,

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:43.415
pick a template and then you can customize

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:46.552
every detail imaginable with drag and drop technology

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.387
for desktop or for mobile.

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:51.457
Then you upload whatever photos or files you need

00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:53.859
and the Squarespace asset library lets you manage

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:55.594
all of your files from one central hub

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:57.763
and use them across the Squarespace platform.

00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:59.531
And then once your site is out in the wild,

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:01.600
you'll get detailed analytic insights

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.602
so you can see what's working well

00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:05.738
and what needs a little TLC.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:06.939
And if you need help,

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:09.074

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.377

If you guys enjoyed this video,

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.153
hey, I'm gonna throw over to the Channel Super Fun we did

00:15:21.153 --> 00:15:25.190
in the studio back when it was just an empty box like this.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.458
Man, looking at it now,

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:29.728
it's hard to believe that it was ever just bare concrete

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:31.730
and walls and I promise you guys,

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.066
this place is gonna look flipping amazing

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.001
even though it doesn't look like much yet.

00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:37.303
Chase is on the case.

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:38.704
It's a Paw Patrol reference.

00:15:38.704 --> 00:15:40.172
I can tell you have kids.
