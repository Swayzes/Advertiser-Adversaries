00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.680
- All right, so today I got a hold of

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.230
and got to poke around the new iPhone 15

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.940
and the iPhone 15 Pros.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.860
I do remember flying here and I'm thinking

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.300
what could Apple possibly do?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.640
Like what could they possibly
introduce with a new iPhone,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.460
the 23rd iPhone that's
actually interesting?

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.360
Now, there is more stuff

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.100
than just the iPhone that was mentioned

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.710
at this Wonderlust event that Apple hosted

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.910
including some stuff that straight up

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.480
wasn't mentioned on stage at
all, so we'll get to that.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.770
But this is just the new iPhone stuff.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.690
So stay tuned and get
subscribed to see the rest.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.570
But let's just talk about
the new iPhone 15 and 15 Pro.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.610
So here's a lens to look
at all this stuff through.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.040
Coming into this, basically
everything Apple just added

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.130
to their newest flagship
phones falls into two buckets.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.260
It's either something we've already seen

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.000
in some other phone for years,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.490
or it's some ecosystem feature

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.770
that only works with other iPhones,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.850
which is not necessarily a bad thing,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.400
but it's just a lens to
look through this stuff at,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.480
just to keep an eye on it.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.790
So this is the iPhone 15.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.990
There's the same two sizes, again,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.660
iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.390
And yeah, you know there's
some small changes,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.410
like the slight soft corner
radii on the aluminum rails

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.120
and the one piece glass back

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.670
fading between a lighter
and darker version

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.680
of the same color, like this new pink one.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.030
It's pretty seamless.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.710
Also, satin soft touch backs

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.750
across the whole lineup instead of glossy.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.190
I definitely like that.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.840
But the big headlining
feature really is its USB now.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.310
Lightning is officially dead.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.550
These new iPhones are all
USB-C across the board.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.740
Now on one hand, this is a huge deal,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.960
like there's only ever
been one port change

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.980
in the iPhone ever.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.910
Back in 2012, it went from
that 30-pin connector thing

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.460
to this new lightning thing,
which we've had ever since.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.490
And now the second one ever is USB type C.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.830
But on the other hand it's,
I don't know, it's just USB.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.620
Like it's the same port
all these other laptops

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.360
and tablets all over the planet have had

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.770
for the past couple years.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.300
I imagine that might
be another year or two

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.780
before the whole lineup,
like the baseline cheap iPad

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.750
and the iPhone SE and
everything else gets USB-C.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.860
But yeah, I don't know.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.870
We knew it was coming, but
it's still kind of surreal

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.050
to look at an iPhone and
see a USB port on it.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.720
So what does this enable
is a real question, right?

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.840
First of all, it's the one
cable that you can ideally use

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.620
to charge all your stuff,
so your Mac, your iPad,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.680
your iPhone, your friend's Android phone,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.830
the new AirPods which
just got a new USB-C case.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.300
All that stuff, one cable.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.400
Oh, and now you can charge accessories

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.650
like the new AirPods with the wire.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.570
So there's no wireless
reverse charging right now,

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.000
but that C to C cable
that comes in the box,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.380
you can like plug it into the iPhone,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.550
plug it into the AirPods

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.370
and charge the AirPods up
from the iPhone battery.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.203
So that's pretty cool.

00:02:36.203 --> 00:02:39.480
But they did hold back
on one very key thing

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.240
and they saved it for the iPhone 15 Pro.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.060
So I'll get to that in a
bit, but that's the USB-C.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.240
Aside from that, really it's
a slightly updated phone.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.530
It's a little bit of a new display.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.480
You know, you get the Dynamic
Island here, of course,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.920
on these baseline iPhones

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.780
and there's also now a
higher peak brightness,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.950
2,000 nits now

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.800
which is twice as bright
as the iPhone 14s.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.970
And there's a new camera.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.490
The primary camera is
now a 48-megapixel chip,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.540
presumably the same one

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.360
that was in the iPhone 14 Pro last year

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.920
and all the benefits that come with that.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.790
And then the rest of the phone

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.440
really follows that same formula.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.510
They do this thing where
the new baseline phone

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.900
is basically last year's
Pro phone repackaged,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.600
so it inherits the same A16 Bionic chip

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.190
from last year's Pro phone.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.020
The coolest feature of this phone though,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.700
and you know, it's also on the Pro phone

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.200
but I still think it's pretty solid,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.250
is the camera has this new
next-generation portrait mode

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.080
but basically it automatically detects

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.820
when there's a subject in a photo

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.640
and captures all of the
depth information needed

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.570
to be able to turn it into
a portrait mode photo later.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.770
So you don't have to remember

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.890
to switch it to portrait
mode necessarily every time.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.470
And if you ever forget but
want to add that blur later,

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.150
you can do it with high quality results.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.170
So that's cool.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.670
Aside from that, the rest of the phone,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.380
I mean it's the same thing, right?

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.780
Same sizes, guys, same ceramic shield,

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.300
same dust and water resistance

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.780
and same starting prices, 799 for the 15

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.790
and 899 for the 15 Plus.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.770
So then there is the Pro phones,

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.250
the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.900
There is some more new here.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.820
A lot of it, I'm actually
gonna want to test

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.500
just to see if it's
actually what they say,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.050
but make sure you get subscribed
to see those full reviews

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.120
when they come out later this
month and we can figure out

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.990
if the phones are worth it.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.480
But basically it's not bleeding edge stuff

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.770
that we've never seen before.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.600
It's just welcome stuff.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.210
And those are mostly in build quality,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.160
the chip inside, and the cameras.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.720
So let's just start with the chip inside.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.430
First of all, it's a brand new chip

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.740
that's called the A17 Pro.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.510
It's the first time
they've used the word Pro

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.470
in an iPhone chip,

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.300
and it's their first three nanometer chip,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.830
so it promises some performance

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.750
and efficiency improvements as a result.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.550
I think they said it's like 10% faster

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.070
high performance cores
and the neural engines

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.930
up to twice as fast, bunch of other stuff.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.460
Not sure how much of this
you'll actually notice

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.630
in everyday use, but hey,

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.940
future proofing and headroom
is never a bad thing,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.100
so this is clearly a powerful chip.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.860
They showed a demo of a game
with like faster ray tracing

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.930
which isn't new, but you know,
it helped make their point.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.240
But the interesting thing
to note here with this chip

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.240
is they mentioned the chip has
a new USB 3 controller on it,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.040
which means the 15 and
15 Plus don't have that.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.250
So basically that means
the Pro iPhones USB-C port

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.670
actually gets upgraded USB 3 speeds,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.140
the faster data transfer speeds

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.030
up to 10 gigabits per second,

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.820
but the base iPhones
without that controller,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.750
they get USB-C,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.170
but they're gonna be
stuck at USB 2.0 speeds.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.330
Basically the same we've
always had with lightning,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.490
like 480 megabits per second.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.250
Now this probably won't
make a real difference

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.083
to most people.

00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:40.140
Like I don't know when the last time

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.430
you plugged your phone in was,

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.370
but it's kind of a bummer
that not all of the benefits

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.480
of USB-C come to all of the
phones, but for the Pro phones

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.790
that are gonna be
shooting more ProRes video

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.450
or ProRaw photos, I mean it takes forever.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.040
If you've shot this stuff like I have,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.590
you know it takes forever to
get those off of the phone

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.150
'cause they're big files.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.560
So I kind of wish they'd gone all the way.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.930
I wish they'd done Thunderbolt speeds,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.933
20, 30, 40 gigabits per second.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.690
But yeah, it's just gonna
be USB 3 on the Pro iPhones

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.180
and USB 2 on the base iPhones.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.800
You know what is disappointing, though?

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.080
No fast charging.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.060
I talked about this on
the podcast on "Waveform."

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.350
I'll try to link the episode below,

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.600
but like switching to USB-C, you'd think,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.460
oh, this is a huge opportunity for Apple

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.920
to like explain why they're doing it,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.080
and we know why they're doing it,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.270
but oh, why are you
giving us this new port

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.850
and all this big new USB-C deal

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.110
and it's just the same 20 or
so watt charging we've had

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.020
for the iPhone for forever,
no new fast charging.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.600
Kind of figured they would
try to do that better.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.610
But yeah, this will still
take an hour and a half,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:48.540
two hours to charge.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.620
But anyway, the new design

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.120
is what most people are fawning over

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.530
at the moment with the pros.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.060
So they have switched the rails

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.610
from that shiny
fingerprint stainless steel

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.640
to this new grade 5 titanium alloy

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.590
with a brushed texture.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.120
And it's nice.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.010
First of all, it's noticeably
lighter in the hand,

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.280
which I love and it seems
like it's also enabled them

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.920
to shrink the body of the Pro
iPhones just a little bit.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.420
So they have the same screen sizes,

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.580
but the screens now get
even closer to the edges

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.100
and there's even slightly thinner bezels.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.480
And I actually do notice that.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.520
Now, a lot of people are
also quoting stronger

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.770
as one of the benefits too,
but I really don't think

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.510
this is gonna make as much of a difference

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.560
as people are thinking.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.980
Like the Pro iPhones have had
this stainless steel rails

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.813
for a while now.

00:07:29.813 --> 00:07:31.200
I've dropped this phone,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.750
as you know, I don't have
a case, on the ground.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.580
I've dented the stainless steel rails.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.690
It's fine, it doesn't break.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.100
It's not the stainless steel that breaks,

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.500
it's the glass that breaks.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.333
And as far as we can tell,

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:45.930
it's the same ceramic shield
glass on the iPhone 15 Pro.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:46.770
That hasn't changed.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.210
So if you drop it on the glass,

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.150
you're still gonna have not great results.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.180
But yeah, technically,
sure, titanium is stronger.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.700
Either way, the new colors are black,

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.940
white and this new blue
which is really subtle,

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.300
and then natural which I
guess, it kind of embraces

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.980
the raw titanium feel.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.720
Reminds me of "Starlight,"
if you're curious.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.220
Kinda like this warm tone.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.720
Weirdly, I think I like it the most.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.640
But also something else
Apple set on stage,

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.660
and this was pretty quick

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.650
so you might not have even picked it up,

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.900
but they did mention
that they have redesigned

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.180
a bit of the interior of the chassis

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.450
to make the back glass more replaceable.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.220
So it's a more repairable iPhone design.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.053
Technically.

00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:25.710
It's a small thing, it's
just one little step,

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.420
but it's a step in the right direction

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.220
for a more repairable iPhone.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.240
But my favorite feature,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.680
and before we get to any of the cameras,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.660
I honestly think this
is my favorite feature,

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.660
is the new action button,
a new customizable button

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.730
on the side of the iPhone,
just the Pro iPhone.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.060
So it replaces the mute
switch, which is pretty iconic,

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.790
but it's in the same
spot as the mute switch

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.470
and it's actually customizable.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.670
So it's a pretty small button,

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.040
basically about the
same size as the switch.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.870
And by default, it actually behaves

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.220
just like the mute switch did.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.810
So you actually hold it down

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.860
to switch between muted
or ringer on, great.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.940
But if you dive into the settings,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.670
there's actually a section
for this action button

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.790
and it's actually really
in depth and super solid.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.350
It basically lets you go through and pick

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.670
the function of the button,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.560
and there's way more here than I expected.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.510
So you can keep the mute switch on,

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.250
or you can have it switch you

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.100
in and out of a certain focus
mode, like do not disturb,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.200
or you could pick whichever
other one you want.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.900
You could also have it
auto launch the camera

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.000
and pick whichever camera mode it opens.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.490
You could also do flashlight turning on

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:34.260
or opening up voice memos, or
it can toggle the magnifier.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.300
Or the last option actually
is you can have it trigger

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.830
a series shortcut, which as you know,

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.780
can technically do almost anything,

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.900
including basically launching
any app on your phone.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.200
I think there may be a bit of
a delay from the button press

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.050
to the app opening, if I'm
thinking about this correctly,

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:49.980
like it's done in the past

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.660
but I'll have to test
that for the full review.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.100
But theoretically, you can map this button

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.190
to open whatever, your calendar
app, your to-do list app,

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.510
whatever app you want

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.490
which is totally not what I expected

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.780
to be on the list of things you could do

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.970
with a new button on
the side of the iPhone.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:03.803
But now you can.

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:04.830
But then last but not least,

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.390
the new cameras across the board here.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.780
There's a new larger 48-megapixel
main sensor for the Pros

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.460
and improved ultra wide.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.700
And then the Pro Max, just the Pro Max

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.500
gets a new intricate
folding 5X telephoto camera.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.760
I'm guessing if I asked Apple,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.770
they would say that
there is only enough room

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.070
in the bigger Pro Max to
fit this folding lens.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.690
I'll ask, we'll see what they say.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.970
But until then, the regular 15 Pro

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.490
is gonna still have the 3X telephoto,

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.960
the regular 3X from last year.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.970
And then we found this
seemingly random feature,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:36.803
it's in the settings,

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.280
they also talked about it in the keynote,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.090
but where you can change
your default focal length

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:47.090
to be either 1X or 1.2X
or 1.5X, for some reason.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.120
So it's buried in the middle
of the camera settings,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.760
but you can tell it to default

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.700
to one of these specific
three focal lengths.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.100
So if you switch back to the camera app,

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.830
that 1X button is now
always going to take you

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.990
to the new focal length
that you've chosen.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.370
And you can still get to 1X

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.080
or whatever other focal length you want,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.213
but I just found that interesting.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.710
If you're someone that
takes 1.2X photos so often

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.470
that you want a button to
get there as fast as possible

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.890
'cause it's the perfect focal
length for you, then sure.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:20.880
Maybe if you're a photographer,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.920
you don't wanna do the
work of digital cropping,

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.350
just hit that focal
length every time, sure.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.370
But there's been a lot of comments

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.200
that at the end of the
day, it feels like USB

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.960
is literally the biggest
headlining new feature

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.410
of this year's new iPhone, which is crazy.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.070
I can't quite get rid of
my lightning cable yet.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.190
There's still some accessories,
there's like MagSafe Duo

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.160
there's AirPods Max, there's
like the Magic Trackpad,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.290
there's a couple things that
still are lightning now,

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.060
maybe they'll switch that
in the next couple months.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.710
But now I'm genuinely curious
if there's going to be

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.680
a bunch of new USB-C phone accessories

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.200
because of of the iPhone getting USB-C,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.420
similar to our sponsor
of this video, Anker.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.430
So they've made a whole
new lineup of products

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.310
for the iPhone 15
headlined by the Anker Nano

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.760
which is like this little small
but mighty USB-C power bank

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.090
that can crank out 30 watts
with the built-in USB-C cable

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.530
and it can also charge it up 30 watts.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.030
And if you have that little
button up at the top here,

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.980
it'll actually show a literal percentage

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.320
of how much battery you have
left, or if you're plugged in,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.110
it'll show you a time which
counts down so you really know

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.890
exactly how much of the 10,000
milliamp-hours you have left.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.090
Plus there's some other
stuff in the lineup.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.090
There's a wall charger,
braided USB-C cables galore.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.160
So feel free to learn more
about Anker's new lineup

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.030
at the link below

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.680
and shout out to Anker
for sponsoring this video.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.440
So iPhone 15 Pro will start at
the same price as last year,

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.670
which is 999,

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.210
but they've bumped up
iPhone 15 Pro Max sneakily.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.060
Interestingly, it will start at 1,199

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.370
but it's also the only
one with the 5X camera

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.120
and it's the only one
that starts at 256 gigs.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.350
And last year, the price of
the 256 gig Pro was the same,

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.000
so you're kind of matching.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.970
It's just like getting
rid of the $1,100 phone,

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.380
for some reason.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.510
Either way, let me know
if you're interested

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.460
in these new iPhones at all.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.680
You're either in camp don't care at all,

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.750
or you're in camp like
totally getting one of these.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.910
Or maybe you're watching
to see if the reviews

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.890
prove that the new features are worth it.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.000
Let me know what you're thinking.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.740
Comment section's always open.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.500
Thanks for watching, and I'll
catch you in the next one.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.333
Get subscribed.

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:18.166
See you later.

00:13:18.166 --> 00:13:18.999
Peace.

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:21.413
(cool music)
