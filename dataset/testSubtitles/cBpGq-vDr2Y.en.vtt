00:00:00.327 --> 00:00:01.350
- You know what's funny?

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.930
When there is not that many changes,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.820
it really puts a magnifying glass

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.643
on the few changes that
there actually are.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.240
Have you ever listened to a car reviewer

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.390
describe the latest
generation Porsche 911?

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.270
Like, this is a car that's
looked more or less the same

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.380
for the past 50 years
with slight evolutions

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.820
with each new generation.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.940
And literally, every time
you watch or read a review,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.657
they always say every single time,

00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:29.850
"Oh, it's so refined,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.980
oh, this is an engineering masterpiece

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.118
that's been perfected over generations.

00:00:34.118 --> 00:00:35.970
It's a formula that's been developed

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.830
in the same direction for years."

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.820
I actually, as a kid,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.676
I used to actively dislike
Porsches because I just,

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:43.050
I knew they were expensive,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.190
but I thought they're all so boring,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.390
they all look like the same thing.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.820
Why would you get one of
those, when you could get

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.206
a way more exciting
Ferrari or McLaren instead?

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:54.540
But as I've gotten older,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.280
I can appreciate the Porsche
formula a little more.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.920
I don't love it or anything,
I wouldn't say I love it,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.330
but I can appreciate it
more, does that make sense?

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.530
I hope that makes sense.

This is the iPhone 15 Pro.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.513
Not a lot of changes.

00:01:46.447 --> 00:01:47.820
(logo whooshing)

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.350
So, okay, I think people
gotta get this thought

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.170
out of their head that you've
gotta upgrade every year

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.100
to the newest phone.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.660
Like, I realize most of
us already know this,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.060
but for some reason, people
are still stuck on this thing

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.250
where they say, "Oh, last year's phone

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.530
is barely different
from this year's phone,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.000
it's not worth upgrading."

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.863
But like, that's not new,

00:02:03.863 --> 00:02:06.960
like the Zenfone 10 I just reviewed

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.390
is just a refinement of Zenfone 9.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.070
Like the bleeding edge ROG phone

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.780
has looked the same for three years now,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.880
the Pixel is finding
its stride with design.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.320
But what we're really looking for

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.340
is for them to fix anything
that's wrong or bad,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.500
and then just find ways, clever ways,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.460
good, interesting ways

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.200
to just get a little
bit better every year,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.400
so that over a long time,
over a bunch of improvements,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.120
it adds up to a bigger,
more significant change.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.090
So that's what's happening
here with this iPhone 15 Pro.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.530
I've been using it for
about two weeks now.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.150
They've made some improvements,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.960
but now we're starting to also
see some possible problems,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.640
some new issues that have risen
up, so let's talk about it.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.920
So there's basically four new
features they've added here.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.630
I'm gonna go over some
of the more fundamental

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.620
and existential stuff in the
regular iPhone 15 review,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.970
so definitely make sure you're subscribed

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.110
to see that when it comes out.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.943
But for the Pro,

00:02:58.943 --> 00:03:00.330
it's time to deep dive on the stuff

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.758
that's unique to this one,
the professional stuff.

00:03:03.758 --> 00:03:06.693
That being the build, the chip,

00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:10.170
the cameras and the Action Button.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.400
So easiest place to start

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.080
is the way they've built this phone.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.970
So Apple made an update to the build

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.130
and the materials of the iPhone this year,

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.200
they've softened the corners a little bit,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.120
it's clearly still a boxy
design, but, you know,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.400
now, instead of a completely
flat glass at the front,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.490
there's this gentle little
curve just at the very edges.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.290
I think that'll maybe
make screen protectors

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.370
slightly more intricate,

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.870
but I think it has a nice look to it.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.060
And then the screen sizes
are exactly the same,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.550
but now the bezels are
actually a tiny bit slimmer

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.383
all the way around.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.260
So technically the phone

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.230
is like one millimeter smaller diagonally

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.570
and the rails have famously switched from

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.490
that shiny stainless steel

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.670
to a lighter, coated and brushed titanium.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.210
The result, it's very
slightly better, I think.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.440
It's kind of funny,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.990
I've always associated a heavy phone

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.230
with like expensive feeling, you know?

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.060
Like, the ceramic phones
are like extra heavy,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.551
they feel like substance.

00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:04.140
But I understand why people
want it to be lighter.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.240
And so, this phone is
actually noticeably lighter

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.080
than the previous Pro.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.472
It's 10% on paper, but it
feels like more than 10%.

00:04:10.472 --> 00:04:11.580
And then, there's a new set of colors too

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.870
so I'm sticking with it,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.270
this new natural titanium
is the best color,

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.700
this is the first year I am not ordering

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.380
a dark or black iPhone.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.027
They still look good, don't get me wrong,

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:24.660
but they get all kinds of
fingerprints on them like crazy.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.950
And also, my worries about
the light colored scratches,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.000
if you go deep enough,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.430
were all confirmed by
Zack, JerryRigEverything,

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.900
in his video cutting the thing up.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.990
So because I'm on team no case,

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.590
I'm going with the all gray phone,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.540
I think it looks dope,
so I'm going with that.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.740
I think basically the idea is,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.360
if you have a perfectly working phone,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.130
there's no world where you
should upgrade to this one

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.480
just for the titanium build

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.460
or just for the slightly thinner bezels.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.050
But you have to appreciate,

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.570
put this up next to an
iPhone 11, then, yeah,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.907
you can see the differences
compounding over time.

00:04:53.907 --> 00:04:57.870
Just like if you sat in a
992 generation 911 right now

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.360
after sitting in a 997 generation car.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.846
But the real highlight of this
build here, let's be honest,

00:05:02.846 --> 00:05:07.846
is there's a new port at
the bottom, that USB type C,

00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:09.780
which makes a big
difference to people like me

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.790
who have other gadgets in their life,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.940
computers, headphones, mouse, keyboard,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.220
I just bring one charger,
it works with everything.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.060
I have already had this rite
of passage moment that everyone

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.080
who gets this phone is gonna have

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.760
where you have an existing Lightning cable

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.350
and you try to plug it
in and then you're like,

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.082
oh right, new cable.

00:05:27.082 --> 00:05:28.860
But now I've gotten used to it.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.760
But the thing is,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.780
I could have sworn Apple
would do more with this port.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.640
Like, okay, we know that

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.620
they were basically forced
into doing this by the EU,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.720
so shout out to the EU for that.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.070
Now we have a USB iPhone,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.600
but like the only pitch is just,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.392
hey, one cable for everything.

00:05:44.392 --> 00:05:46.020
That's it, Apple really?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.720
So like with 30 pin to
Lightning all those years ago,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.650
the benefit was obvious,

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.200
it's just so much smaller of a port

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.390
so that let them fit
more stuff in the phone,

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.500
plus it's reversible now.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.630
Now with this USB type C, it's like okay,

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.270
it was already small, it
was already reversible,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.570
charging speed did not improve
at all, it's still 25 watts.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.060
There's no extra like desktop mode,

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.320
plug it into a monitor and get,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.060
there's no decks or
anything like that, right?

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.493
It's just one cable for everything.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.270
Okay, fine, sure, welcome to the club.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.243
You know, iPhone users
can now take advantage

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:19.526
of the U in USB-C.

00:06:19.526 --> 00:06:21.570
I talked about the handshake it does

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.850
with plugging directly into other phones

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.190
and reverse charging them
at four and a half watts

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.440
in the unboxing video, that's pretty neat.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.940
You can also plug in other things,

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.000
plug in a keyboard and type
with it, plug in a monitor,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.370
it'll mirror your screen at up to 4K 60.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.840
And the Pro phone now supports

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.180
USB 3.0 data transfer speeds

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.070
so you can get that ProRes footage

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.350
off the phone noticeably faster,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.120
and you can actually, for the first time,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.820
shoot video directly
onto an external drive.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.370
Now there's some talk about the
cable that comes in the box.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.280
Remember that nice high
quality braided USB-C cable

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.840
that comes in the box?

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.650
But it's only USB 2.0 transfer
speeds, it's a slow cable.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.640
So if you have a Pro phone,

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.830
you need get a faster
separate cable for it?

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.570
That seemed weird to people,

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.974
but it's not, that's very normal.

00:07:04.974 --> 00:07:06.990
Most smartphones come with

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.058
just a USB-C cable just to charge.

00:07:09.058 --> 00:07:10.410
It's a charging cable.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.670
If you wanted a data cable,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.100
you'd have to buy a
thicker, more robust cable

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.284
that looks the same but is a data cable.

00:07:17.284 --> 00:07:20.820
It's kind of confusing
and annoying actually.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.757
Welcome to the world of USB-C, my friends,

00:07:23.757 --> 00:07:24.960
it's good to have you.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.300
But that is a good segue
to the main enabler,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.050
the new powerhouse chip inside
this phone with a new name,

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.030
the A17 Pro.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.740
So the base iPhone 15s

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.620
got last year's A16
bionic from the 14 Pro.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.380
And so, here's this new more powerful chip

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.050
in the highest end phones
and it's not the A17 Bionic,

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.750
this is the first one with
the Pro name, A17 Pro,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.000
and this thing goes
kind of crazy on paper.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.835
This is their first three nanometer chip,

00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:52.050
actually, the first three
nanometer chip in any phone

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.350
that we'll probably see for
at least another year or two.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.400
I ran some benchmarks,

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.790
it's literally approaching M1 chip levels

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.370
of synthetic benchmark scores,
and compared to last year,

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.680
it's 10 to 20% more powerful

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.310
on both the CPU and the GPU,
which is very respectable.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.390
But more power is like
more horsepower in a car.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.900
It's only really useful or noticeable

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.030
if it lets you do more things with it.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.100
I'm gonna live in this analogy
a bit more for a minute,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.190
but like the last generation
Porsche 911 Turbo S,

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.250
it was already so ballistic fast

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.260
that you never approached that limit

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.580
anywhere on public streets

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.740
until you get to the
highest end of performance,

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.573
on the track.

00:08:32.573 --> 00:08:34.320
And the highest end
iPhone is the same way,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.390
like, the Pro iPhone's been great

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.540
at just surfing Instagram and texting

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.400
and doing all the normal web browsing,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.440
basic stuff you'd do on a phone.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.120
And so, the only place you'd really notice

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.680
the extra performance is,
well, we got a gaming demo.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.990
Apple showed these wild demos

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.000
on the new iPhone at the keynote.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.440
And just a disclaimer,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.940
I'm not much of a phone gamer

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.670
so I'll defer the commentary
on this to Dave2D,

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.500
you can go watch his video, linked below.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.333
But they literally launched
exclusive games on the iPhone,

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:08.040
that are like "Resident Evil: Village"

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.600
and "Assassin's Creed",

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.610
but not on cut down mobile versions,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.640
these are literally the same
versions with the same assets

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.250
and same textures and everything

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.617
from the PlayStation version

00:09:18.617 --> 00:09:20.910
'cause it literally is
the PlayStation version.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.743
That's impressive.

00:09:21.743 --> 00:09:24.054
Plus you know, performance
headroom is never a bad thing.

00:09:24.054 --> 00:09:26.520
But I think also for me and
for a lot of other people,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.230
the more impactful things

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.270
that you'll actually
notice about this new chip

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.010
are in the dedicated parts of it

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.960
that are for specific tasks.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.730
Like, the new image signal processor

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.070
lets you take really, really fast,

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.290
lag-free photos constantly.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.500
The new neural engine recognizes
Portrait Mode subjects,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.190
like people's faces and
dogs and cats automatically,

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.110
and lets you go back in time

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.566
and set a regular photo
to a Portrait Mode photo.

00:09:51.566 --> 00:09:53.130
The USB 3 controller

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.140
that enables faster data transfer speeds

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.880
is also on the A17 Pro,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.830
all of that is coming from the new chip.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.390
But what I'm more concerned with

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.150
at the moment is battery life.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.260
Okay, so actually, it's
kind of two main issues

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.100
that have been popping up

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.690
that you kind of have
to try to figure out,

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.370
are they isolated issues

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.140
or are these real problems with the phone?

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.530
And those are battery life
and overheating issues.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.850
And to be honest, part of the reason

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.590
this review took like longer than normal

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.990
is I've been really trying
to dig into the battery

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.610
and figure out what's going on here.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.960
So objectively speaking,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.140
these phones have slightly
bigger batteries than last year

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.820
and a new three nanometer chip.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.380
So in a controlled environment,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.240
they should do better and they do,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.510
they literally last longer on
like simple benchmark stuff.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.250
So that's good news.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.410
Now when I test a phone, like normal,

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.540
I pretty much, I kind of go by feel,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.180
I always have some mix of good days,

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.910
some average days and then some bad days,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.920
where I can sort of figure
out what's draining it,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.060
what its weaknesses are

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.910
and then I can come to
a conclusion from that.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.750
So now here we are, I
get a couple days in,

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.280
I get a couple weeks in

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.920
and I've had a good
amount of average days,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.669
I've had a couple of
those bad draining days,

00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:05.280
but I also haven't had
any of those amazing days

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.590
where I get like nine
hours of screen on time.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.120
I just haven't had any yet.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.950
And then, we also started to
see some of those headlines

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.710
about battery life potentially being worse

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.270
and there's also some overheating issues

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.940
popping up on Twitter or X

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.010
and some people were asking
if mine has had any issues.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.540
So here's the weird answer,

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.480
yes, but not when I would expect,

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.820
Two days ago, literally, I
was just at a golf tournament,

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.310
it was in Florida, it was
like 100 degree really feel

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.240
or something crazy like that.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.340
And I'm outside with my
phone at max brightness

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.670
with GPS going all day out in the sun,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.950
and it was fine, no problem,
no overheating issues.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.000
But then, a couple hours later,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.850
I'm on the airplane with
my phone in Airplane Mode

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.860
and I've got just like
music playing on Bluetooth

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.560
with Spotify and like
scrolling through Instagram,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.570
and for like five minutes,

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.800
the phone just gets really hot

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.720
and just blasts through like 5% battery,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.950
and then it's fine again afterwards,

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.130
and I'm like, there almost
seems to be no rhyme or reason

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.080
why it does this randomly once in a while.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.680
So my best theory is
that the A17 Pro is just,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.390
it's a more powerful
chip and so therefore,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.880
is able to drain power
more quickly than before

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.553
in high intensity settings,
like gaming, et cetera.

00:12:08.553 --> 00:12:12.030
And there's also been some
issues attributed to iOS 17 bugs,

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.400
like we're already on 17.0.2.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.170
I imagine there's some more updates coming

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.200
to both iOS and a bunch of apps.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.033
But by the end of this,

00:12:20.033 --> 00:12:21.840
I kind of feel like I'm
expecting battery life

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.450
to basically even out to
be the same as last year,

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.820
which is a boring answer, but
that's kind of what I expect.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.470
Now we can talk all we want

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.460
about what the word Pro
actually means in a smartphone,

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.150
but with iPhones, that
has mostly meant cameras.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.060
And it turns out there is a lot going on

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.510
with these relatively
similar looking cameras

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.730
on these new Pro phones, both
in hardware and software.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.820
So you're looking at a new
bigger 48 megapixel main camera.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.410
There's also an improved ultra wide

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.630
with a closer up macro capability

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.104
and a whole telephoto situation

00:12:54.104 --> 00:12:55.530
that we'll get to in a minute.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.560
But then with software,
there is this whole new

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.670
intricate image processing
pipeline happening.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.440
So you know how most smartphones,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.320
a lot of 'em today have
like 48 megapixel cameras

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.840
and they all bin down to 12 megapixels.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.190
They give you 12 megapixel shots.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.260
You know, previous iPhones did this,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.780
this new one, for those
who might've missed it,

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.130
is actually by default

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.975
spitting out 24 megapixel
images instead of 12,

00:13:21.975 --> 00:13:24.060
and it's only about one and
a half times of file size.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.170
So this new process,

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.640
which is the same
actually across the board

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.430
for iPhone 15s and 15 Pros,

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.090
is it's taking a 48
megapixel full sensor shot

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.610
for detail information

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.420
and also taking a full
sensor 12 megapixel shot,

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.470
which is the quad binning for
light information and noise.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.220
And then, it's using the
neural net to combine them

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.320
and do a sort of a detailed transfer

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.010
to get you this hybrid 24 megapixel image.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.207
It's very complicated, very clever,

00:13:56.207 --> 00:14:01.207
and the end result is slightly better.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.750
It's really right in line
with what I've been saying.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.871
So if you just generally look
at photos shot on this camera,

00:14:07.871 --> 00:14:11.070
it's an iPhone photo, like,
they look pretty great,

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.660
they're awesome with dynamic range

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.160
and sharpness across the board.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.180
I still prefer

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.676
and shoot in the rich contrast
profile most of the time,

00:14:17.676 --> 00:14:20.460
but, yeah, mostly, the iPhone
is one of the best cameras

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.870
at just pointing and shooting,

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.300
in full auto, just getting
results that look good,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.200
even if it doesn't look the
most like real life, you know,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.260
it's doing the classic
relighting and tone mapping

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.680
and everything we're used
to from all this smart HDR,

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.370
it's all here and a lot of
people like it and it looks good.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.530
The improved Macro Mode
is also really good.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.260
And with this natural fall
off with the primary camera

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.580
without even needing Portrait Mode,

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.442
you can get some blurred
backgrounds, it's awesome.

00:14:47.442 --> 00:14:49.710
Autofocus is also really, really fast,

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.420
especially whenever there's
a face in the scene,

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.862
this thing loves seeing faces.

00:14:52.862 --> 00:14:55.200
And the benefit of the bigger sensor

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.940
shows itself at night too

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.580
with even longer handheld captures.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.580
It's not magic, it's just
physics, but, you know,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.490
does the 24 megapixel make a difference

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.590
over the 12 megapixel?

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.870
Well, zoomed out, absolutely not,

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.220
they look basically the same.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.060
So you gotta zoom in,

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.690
and even at 50% zoom, you
still can't really tell.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.990
It's not until you zoom all
the way in that you can,

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.310
okay, you can see a difference,

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.020
you can start to notice a difference

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.670
in fine detail and contrast.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.400
The 15 Pro is definitely,
when your pixel peeping,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.410
more contrasty and sharp

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.230
when you're all the way
zoomed in versus last year.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.854
But that's just when you've
zoomed all the way in.

00:15:33.854 --> 00:15:37.080
And by the way, once you get past 2X zoom,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.480
it's back to kicking out
regular 12 megapixel images.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.620
So again, it's like,

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.650
it's a small, small
year-over-year improvement

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:47.280
with that tiny amount of
like pixel peeping detail,

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.150
but over a longer distance,
over a bunch of generations,

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.860
that's the type of thing that adds up.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.940
They even, on the Pro phones,

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.760
did a couple of presets from the 1X lens.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.340
There's a 24 millimeter
all the way zoomed out,

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.860
then a 28 millimeter,
a little bit tighter,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.130
and a 35 millimeter
that all have their own

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.010
dedicated image processing
pipeline presets

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.810
to maximize detail into

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.510
these basically super
res, zoom, focal lengths

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.520
that you can digitally zoom between.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.760
I wouldn't exactly call it
having extra lenses on the phone,

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.120
but, you know, 1.5X zoom
on last year's phone

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.350
versus 1.5X zoom on this year's
phone, slight difference.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.970
But there is a difference.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.460
Honestly, the most Pro things
about these new phones though

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.740
is definitely their video cameras,

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.350
so I'm just gonna nerd out
about these for a second.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.830
Because the iPhone's video capabilities,

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.160
I've talked about this so much,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.500
but they're still so clearly far out

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.000
in front of the rest of
the smartphone world.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.470
It doesn't even shoot 8K,

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.140
which it's totally capable
of with the 48 megapixels.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.490
I wish they would let us,

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:52.410
but even just at 4K 30
in full auto, the detail,

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.890
the auto focus, the slight
depth, the dynamic range,

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.680
the stabilization,
they're all world class.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.690
I mean, if you wanna just
look at test footage,

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.330
the entire electric Rivian
delivery van review I did

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.300
on the Auto Focus channel
was shot on iPhone 15 Pro,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.460
audio included, I'll drop the link below

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.930
if you wanna watch that whole thing.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.810
Also, shout out to the new
AV1 Codec support on the chip,

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.790
that's gonna play nice with YouTube.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.940
But this year, you can also shoot Log,

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.820
literally a Pro camera feature.

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.250
Now it is annoyingly buried

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.520
several layers deep in
the separate Settings app,

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.800
which is really not very Pro.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.870
But if you find the time
to go switch over there

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.190
and get into Log,

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:35.070
the iPhone will shoot
with way more information,

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.640
that classic flat Log look,
dynamic range, everything.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.980
And you don't have to deal with
whatever Apple was gonna do

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.530
with over sharpening and
saturation and processing.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.210
Apple has its own transformation LUT

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.370
to turn it into SDR or HDR

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.440
or you can go in and
fully grade it yourself

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.660
to really get the most
out of the iPhone's video

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.560
and it looks really,
like, really, really good.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.020
So the one thing that I'm
gonna say to, you know,

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.210
because I'm pixel peeping at this point,

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.480
is the haloing from point light sources.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.890
You know, it's one of
the hardest challenges

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:05.880
with these tiny optics

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.590
so I get why they haven't
just fixed it yet,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.060
but like it's pretty bad.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.520
Anytime there's any sort of point lights,

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.960
especially with video,

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.940
despite whatever new lens
coding they're doing,

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.860
it's pretty dramatic and it
seems like it's the worst

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.240
on the iPhone of any other phone.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.250
So it's there, gonna point it out again,

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.358
but, hey, if that's the biggest
downside of iPhone video,

00:18:23.358 --> 00:18:24.510
I'll definitely take it.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.460
And then, iPhone 15 Pro Max,

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.290
the big one is the only
one that comes with

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.389
the new 5X larger telephoto lens.

00:18:31.389 --> 00:18:34.020
I would bet my life that
that's gonna come down

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.870
to the smaller 16 Pro next year, whatever,

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.070
but it's only in the big one this time.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.630
But yeah, it does let
you get a little further

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.590
with max zoom, from 15X to 25X.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.190
It's nice if you do a lot
of zoomed photos and videos,

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.540
which is a very specific crowd,

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.590
there's some people that do that,

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.870
you know, concert goers, things like that.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.390
But there are just very few
people who should buy one

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.340
just for this lens because it also means

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.080
you have to have a bigger phone

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.900
and it also happens to
mean that your 4X photos

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.730
just before you get to 5X

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.170
will actually be worse on this phone.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.640
But, yeah, it's not nearly as capable

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.740
as some of the longer
telephoto periscope lens.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.380
I mean Samsung has a 10X optical lens

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.380
that blows this one out the
water in terms of reach,

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.770
I think Apple's main advantage
really is just stabilization.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.410
Like, they finally do that
zoom in preview window

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.760
on the corner of the viewfinder

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.200
and they overstabilize the frame,

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.760
so you can zoom all the way in

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.757
and get a shot in super
creeper mode, it's great.

00:19:26.757 --> 00:19:28.680
But I'm just gonna
shamelessly borrow a line

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.630
from Mr. Mobile because he said it

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.360
as well as anyone possibly
could, and he's right,

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.910
which is just that so
much of the differences

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.460
between these cameras, this one,

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.070
the last iPhone, the Samsungs,
the Pixels of the world,

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.070
so much of the differences
between them is software

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.410
that it's hardly even consistent anymore.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.170
So if you are looking
for like a hard verdict

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.960
on like iPhone 15 Pro side by side

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.509
versus Samsung versus Pixel
or Oppo, whatever else,

00:19:56.509 --> 00:19:58.890
you kind of just have to
make it up after a while,

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.600
like, yeah, there are
gonna be certain instances,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.250
like exact zoom focal lengths

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.840
where one is sharper than the other,

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.130
but honestly, at at the end of the day,

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.900
a lot of it is gonna be taste.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.850
And so, yeah, you just
kind of have to figure out

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.062
which one you like as far as image quality

00:20:11.062 --> 00:20:12.570
and especially UI,

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.970
just the actual way you
shoot photos and videos.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.440
Which reminds me, I do wanna mention,

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.982
this RAW Max button is hilarious.

00:20:19.982 --> 00:20:22.110
This is a button to take

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.200
your full res 48 megapixel Pro RAW photos,

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.020
but it just says RAW Max, okay.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.270
And if you want a 48 megapixel JPEG,

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.210
you have to jump back into the
Settings app, switch it over,

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.500
then bounce back, and now
the button says JPEG Max,

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.114
which is also hilarious.

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:40.740
Last thing I gotta say though,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.040
this new Pro phone has an Action Button

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.510
on this new Pro iPhone only

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.030
because only pros need customization.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:52.140
Look, I kind of love the Action Button,

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.160
but I also need to realize

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.010
that it's kind of either
overrated or underrated,

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.210
depending on who you are.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.360
Like, on one hand, it's
literally a customizable button,

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.280
like, who even saw this coming?

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.650
It replaces the least used button

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.150
that was on previous iPhones

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.790
because your phone should
always be on mute anyway.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.640
And so, then, you can
map this Action Button

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.980
to basically anything you want.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.270
You can keep it as a mute switch

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.100
and it has the same strong haptics

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.870
so you can tell if it's muted or unmuted

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:20.670
in your pocket without looking.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.380
But there's also a bunch
of other cool functions

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.400
you can pick from,

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.270
from launching your
camera to a voice recorder

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.340
to just literally any app on your phone

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.080
you want through a Siri Shortcut.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.220
Your favorite YouTube channel right now

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.720
is probably making a tutorial

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.880
on the best Siri Shortcuts

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.240
to map to the Action
Button from launching apps,

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.330
to the specific things inside of apps,

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.159
from unlocking your car,

00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:46.980
to not just launching my
favorite task manager app,

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.850
but launching a new task
inside of my task manager app.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.310
It just lets me, it's great,

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.110
it's awesome, honestly,
I hope it gets copied,

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.300
even though a bunch of phones
were doing this years ago

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.133
and then they stopped.

00:21:58.133 --> 00:22:00.450
I hope they bring it
back now in a response

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.440
to how great this is.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.383
But on the other hand,

00:22:03.383 --> 00:22:05.883
I do kind of feel like,
for a lot of people,

00:22:05.883 --> 00:22:07.200
this is gonna be one of those things

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.870
that they play with for
like three or four days

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.880
and then just kind of forget about it

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.780
and never use it again.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.540
And I mostly think that's
because it's not super reachable.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.510
Like, it's not a one handable button

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.060
where your fingers
usually rest for everyone,

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.290
especially on the Pro Max,

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.230
it's way up there on the corner
above the volume buttons.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.330
It could be a cool shutter
button for the camera,

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.370
but the volume buttons already do that,

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.510
so yeah, I feel like you might as well

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.550
just end up setting it
back to a mute switch

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.860
and forgetting about it after a few weeks.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.240
But I guess that's fine too.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.073
It's one of those things

00:22:37.073 --> 00:22:38.880
that you'll just figure
out which user you are

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.365
after you use it for a while.

00:22:40.365 --> 00:22:42.300
Kinda like I've been using

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.280
that Eight Sleep mattress
cover that I was talking about,

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.920
I've been using it for
about three months now,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.320
this is the pod cover
that goes on your mattress

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.620
that either warms you up or
cools you down, helps you sleep.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.270
Like, now that I've used it for a while,

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.520
I've understood, like I
was a skeptic at first,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.320
but honestly, it's one of those things

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.740
where I go to a hotel bed and
I have a harder time sleeping,

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.630
which it used to be the other way around,

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.590
but I just sleep so much
better in the Eight Sleep bed

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.930
'cause it's cooled down
to let you get sleep early

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.330
and then warms up in the
morning to help you wake up.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.560
And it's become really clear that

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.630
temperature is one of the
most important factors

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:16.800
when it comes to sleep,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.240
and it's become real obvious to me

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.830
that falling asleep faster,

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.150
getting better quality sleep

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.010
and then being able to depend on it

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.870
is something I wouldn't
trade for anything.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.300
It's just, it took me
some time to learn that.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.370
Plus there's an app that shows me

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.350
all my info about my sleep every night

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.600
and it lets me adjust
the autopilot if I want.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.480
If your partner sleeps at a
different side on the same bed,

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.420
they can adjust the temperature
in the app too, it's great.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.470
So I'll leave a link to it below,

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.000
and since they're a great sponsor,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.270
they're actually giving you
guys $200 off the pod cover

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:49.443
if you use code "MKBHD"
at eightsleep.com/mkbhd.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.691
But anyway, what's the verdict?

00:23:51.691 --> 00:23:56.343
What's the verdict with
the new Pro iPhone of 2023?

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.040
It's one of those things where like

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.540
I have conversations with friends

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.600
and I always end up having
to try to condense it all

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.460
and summarize it into like one sentence,

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.570
and the truth is like,

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.060
it's the same phone as last year with USB,

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.440
a little bit of a faster chip,

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.940
a little bit of a brighter screen,

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.740
a little bit of thinner bezels,

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.100
and like, I don't know, better
cameras, that's kind of it.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.710
So you have to decide how much
of that is important to you.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.290
Are any of those things important to you?

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.460
Honestly, USB might be
the most important thing

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.673
about the new iPhone, despite
what Apple was hoping.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.150
Welcome to the club, my friends.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.620
Thanks for watching,

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.224
catch you guys in the next one, peace.

00:24:37.224 --> 00:24:39.891
(upbeat music)
