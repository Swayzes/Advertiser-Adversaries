00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.539
We've been seeing ads for this thing for years, and you guys have even suggested making a video about it twice.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.908
But come on!

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:14.914
Look at it. In a world where a top-of-the-line GPU costs a couple of thousand dollars

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:21.654
who in their right mind is spending double that amount on the chair you sit in while you use it?

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:26.593
Oh wait, I know. It's us. It's literally our job to buy

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.896
outlandish stuff like this and show you guys what it's all about.

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:37.437
So with a little help from our sponsor Epomaker, a team of gamers, engineers, and designers who are dedicated to bringing high-quality,

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:40.306
customizable mechanical keyboards to the community at affordable prices.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:44.110
We'll take a closer look at their RT100 keyboard a little bit in this later.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.382
We have finally put the Cluven's Scorpion computer cockpit to the test.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:55.121
and found some unexpected conclusions, but before we get to those let's

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.625
rewind a little bit.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:05.899
After a 10 to 32 day wait for shipping this is what arrived in my driveway, or

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:11.538
to be more specific at the curb at the end of my driveway.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:16.142
Luckily no one stole it, so let's get it inside and take a look

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:22.916
We're gonna have a link in the video description if you guys can't wait to follow my example and blow your own money on one of these.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:24.050
Oh.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.420
But I'm not at the stage yet where I think I'm ready to recommend it.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.826
This is far from the lightest chair that we've ever looked at coming in at a whopping

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:36.362
200 kilograms of shipping weight.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:40.767
To their credit, this is one of the most user-friendly packing crates. I think I've ever seen.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:41.835
Wow!

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.073
That is smaller than I expected.

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:51.277
Say what you will about the size you can't fault the robustness of it.

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:55.682
Come on you-

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:02.622
I wonder what percentage of the injury report forms are me.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.729
How the devil are you supposed to move this thing?

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.498
Dude, there's a lot of pieces in here

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.000
I thought you said the assembly was supposed to be straightforward?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.769
Their assembly video’s only three minutes long, it can’t be that hard.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.471
How many legs the Scorpions have?

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:22.142
When I have this chair my gaming will have no lags.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.080
Whoa!

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:31.551
Now it reaches its full magnificent height.

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.186
That's just mostly packaging.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.788
That's not packaging.

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.870
Oh sick! Look at these lights.

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.406
Okay, I got an arm.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:54.841
Oh it opens up.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:03:01.047
I’m just trying to picture the person whose house you walk into and this is in their living room, you know?

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.149
It sends a message

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.784
What's the message Jordan?

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:05.585
Nothing good.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.687
This is the bubble wrap output of a small nation.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.791
That's quality foam. Oh, sorry, sorry. Oh, oh.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.962
How do you like me now, ladies?

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.634
Yeah, you can, no, no, you can, this is what, it's movable, it's movable.

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:23.636
Thanks Colin, but I think I got it.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.373
Oh, I think I crushed those cables.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.443
Got the instructions up, but before we start them I just gotta say

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.478
where's your tracksuit, buddy?

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.215
The form’s impeccable, but you got to get the stripes.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.850
This is the Scorpion’s decorative foot.

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.752
Also a weapon.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.890
Its only contribution is to be a tripping hazard.

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.426
It's Law and Order.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.596
That one got me, all right.

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.497
Aw it’s gross, the cable’s white.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:54.200
I know right, but it's the one white thing on it.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.502
It comes in white too, and gold. Really?

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.037
And gold? Yeah.

00:03:58.638 --> 00:03:59.439
Okay that- Ohh.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:00.907
Oh that's awesome.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.442
Oh that-

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.981
That's pretty cool.

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:12.118
Next up is our arm with the controls for the scorpion tail and the seat on it.

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:14.654
I don't know what any of these buttons do and they're not labeled

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:19.058
but this seems like a good time to tell you guys the whole thing is made out of powder coated steel

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:23.830
with PU leather over what seems to be a really high quality foam.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.465
It has built-in RGB lighting.

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:31.271
Pre-installed 5 meter cables, ours came with three HDMIs and two DisplayPorts,

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:37.777
and barely 160 degrees of adjustment on the chair seat itself

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.782
That's about five degrees.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:46.119
Will my wife get the insurance if I die in this thing?

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.254
That would be active scorpion, I don't know if that counts.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:49.722
You ready?

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:57.397
Oh there's the other arm.

00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:03.403
Now that's funny, the RGB remote is just one of those wireless RGB remotes

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:05.605
but just embedded in the side of it.

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.173
There we go.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.642
All right.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:14.881
Being able to adjust this forward and back would be good.

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:16.983
Oh, no wait. Oh it does move.

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:18.951
Oh look at, oh wow, look at that!

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.521
It has all the adjustment

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.058
Since we're talking about this arm. I want to look at the RGB control.

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:27.226
This is flipping cool.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.997
You just touch anywhere on the wheel, and then it's that color.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:38.471
We went with the three monitor mount. We've got three of these Gigabyte M27U gaming monitors.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:44.577
They'll do up to 160 Hertz 4K, they’re VESA HDR 600 certified and come with HDMI 2.1

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:49.749
and the reason we cared about that was because we initially thought this didn't come with any DisplayPort pre-wired

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.051
but it turns out it did so-

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:58.558
They've spent money on things that matter like the motors feel good. They feel smooth.

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:00.827
It's reassuring as you're moving it around.

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:05.598
The build quality is obviously a little on the industrial side, you know.

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.134
It's welded steel. What do you want?

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:09.836
How are we gonna get power to the monitors?

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:12.438
There was a power bar up there I think.

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:15.274
Yes, there is in fact a power bar in there.

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:19.312
All we got to do is remove these three screws and we get access to it.

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:21.914
Only three outlets but there's a five monitor mount.

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:26.052
There are such thing as C13, you know, Y splitters and whatever just-

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:29.155
Okay, we found an oversight.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.290
Is this how the RGB is mounted?

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.327
Yeah, I guess it doesn't matter

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:38.865
We'll adjust them in and out afterwards. Yeah, not much in the way of other adjustments though, hey?

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:40.099
Not so much.

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:43.503
You just gotta hope they kind of balance I think. Yeah.

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:46.939
Oh how's the clearance on that?

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.341
Not amazing. Cool.

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:51.110
So we need to put it sideways in order to-

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.680
Which is fine because now it's just like the RGB strip. Exactly.

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:58.184
I'm not sure what the plan is for cable management here.

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:02.455
LTT cable arches to the rescue. There we go.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:05.825
Oh, that's pretty good. That's pretty darn good.

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:13.699
Now obviously for a gaming battle station so magnificent. We're gonna need a pretty magnificent computer. So we've done with the-

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:19.038
What's that Colin? What is it 7800X3D and a 4090?

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.242
I'm just guessing. Oh it is. Oh great.

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:26.012
Realistically which cables you hook up to your monitors

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:29.749
is gonna come down to what IO you have on your graphics card more than anything else.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:34.554
I didn't look at this before we started. So I guess I'm using a DP to HDMI adapter.

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:36.956
Should we see if we got these monitor cables right?

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:40.927
Did we just blow a fuse?

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.628
Wait, we don't even need the power bar

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:47.433
There's another power bar behind another access hatch built into the chair.

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:49.635
Ow, ow, oh.

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:53.739
Do they seriously have the top power bar plugged into this power bar?

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:57.677
And it's not like it's a high current application or anything.

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:01.280
Check this out, the scorpion claws open.

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:04.283
What? No way!

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:08.788
If you have a little kid or a pet and you just really wanted them to not have eyes

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:10.656
then you just leave these open.

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:14.026
That's great. It's dangerous. Just like a real scorpion.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.730
I've got a plan for us to teamwork this Jordan if you can operate the dials

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.235
I'll keep an eye on the cables here and Colin you keep an eye on the cables at the back and if you see any

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:24.170
and if you see any problem, just say something.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.307
Oh.

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:30.209
Oh.

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:31.544
Wait.

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:34.847
There's not even a problem, Colin, for crying out loud, okay.

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:39.418
Jordan, I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little sketched out about lying in this thing.

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:40.453
How's your insurance?

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:41.287
Good.

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:44.790
But the thing about insurance is I'm not the one who gets the payout.

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.760
You always say monetize your death.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.566
It seems like they've done a pretty good job of keeping the length of the cable travels the same regardless.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:59.071
This should address the monitor, but that whole thing where the whole thing shifted is a little sketchy.

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.007
I mean, I'm not getting into it, what do I care?

00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:03.776
Why are you not getting into it?

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:04.777
I’m over the weight limit.

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:05.645
Oh.

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:10.283
That's a thing you encounter sometimes with Asian design

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:15.321
in the North American market you saw the whole thing with Nintendo theme park?

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:16.522
Yeah, were like

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:20.393
the average American male like couldn't go in one of the rides or something like that.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.294
Before we get in,

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:24.096
we didn't have any issues with the cables while we were moving the chair

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:27.466
but that's not necessarily a given forever based on that

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:32.305
these are just kind of hanging loose and there seemed to be some things in here that they could get caught on.

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:34.907
The good news is I think we figured out how to get into it.

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:42.114
No problem.

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.650
Oh we haven't talked about our peripherals yet.

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:51.958
This is Epomaker's RT100 mechanical keyboard the gasket mounted design is both quiet and comfortable.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:59.865
While it's 97 keyed layout offers a compact form-factor without having to give up a dedicated number pad or media controls.

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:03.636
That's in no small part. Thanks to the multi-function media control knob.

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:08.374
It's got USB C, Bluetooth 5.0, and 2.4 gigahertz wireless connectivity

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:12.511
meaning you can connect to your PC or Mac or I mean, whatever. It's Bluetooth, right?

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:19.452
However you prefer, and hidden in the storage bay for the 2.4 gigahertz receiver is the connector for the smart mini display.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:25.591
A programmable smart display that shows essential system and real-world data right out of the box and

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:30.262
just like the south facing RGB lighting on every key is customizable to suit your preferences.

00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:32.632
We'll get more hands-on with the RT100 in a minute

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:36.135
but first you need to get some games loaded on this thing.

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.871
Oh, shoot. I never checked if I plugged in the right things.

00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:40.306
Well, this one's got a signal.

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.775
What are the odds I got only one of three?

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:49.281
No question, if the goal is to find the chair that makes you feel like an absolute boss

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:50.616
Your journey's over.

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:52.318
These monitors look great though.

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:55.488
Man 4K is sharp at this distance.

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:59.358
The kind of setup that just puts a smile on your face, you know?

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:05.698
There are some issues, at my height exactly, the monitors are in the right spot when the angle is right

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:08.300
and there’s not really a ton of adjustment on these things.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:14.173
Also, I'm already noticing that when I move the mouse and type on the keyboard, there's a little bit of

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:16.676
Wiggle wobble.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:20.146
Now we got this working. Holy crap.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.183
Think the best thing I can say about the chair right now

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.752
is I kind of forgot I was sitting in it.

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.821
And I really do mean that in a good way

00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:33.325
the worst chair is the one that you think about while you're inside it.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:35.394
Jordan. What's up?

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:39.665
Remember how we adjusted the angle of this display just right?

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.735
Well now- Yeah? It's pointed up this way.

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:43.302
Oh.

00:11:43.302 --> 00:11:46.872
So the fact that I have no on-the-fly adjustment means that

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.912
unless I had a fourth motor right here in this one, which we checked, we don't.

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:54.480
I have no way of

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.750
adjusting this angle after the fact.

00:11:57.983 --> 00:12:03.656
Well, my keyboard and mouse- Oh, no, okay, it comes in a little bit. The angle is a little funky

00:12:05.024 --> 00:12:09.595
The benefit of that is that it doesn't tip towards you like on some of these that I've seen in the past

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:13.032
The disadvantage is that your arms are like this.

00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:15.668
Widescreen gaming forum still thing?

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:18.571
I got to give some credit to the RT 100 here sponsored or not

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:23.776
It's a little narrower which objectively creates more mousing space in a scenario like this

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:28.981
but unlike a tenkeyless if I wanted to use this for work as well, and I needed a number pad

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:30.816
everything's there. It's good to go.

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:34.453
We're gonna switch over to Forza, which definitely supports- okay.

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:40.526
That we can fix, the ergonomics of the cup holder on the other hand.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.831
Okay

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:49.502
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:52.138
If I wanted to hold a controller here,

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.040
to get this completely out of the way

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.578
going over my legs like that.

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:05.184
And then now it’s so far away that if I do need it for something to navigate a menu or

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:07.553
cause I got an email, I gotta

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:09.588
drag it way back over here.

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:12.391
In fairness to Cluvens,

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:16.462
I haven’t seen good solutions to most of these problems.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.731
So the question in my mind isn't so much

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:23.369
Should you buy the Cluven Scorpion if you're shopping for one of these chairs as it is

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:31.710
should you even be considering one of these chairs because I've yet to use one that even for free I would consider putting in my house.

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:38.851
Obviously people are buying them though, or they wouldn't exist which if you think about it is kind of a good thing.

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:42.721
The immersiveness is great. So whatever my feelings are about these things

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:50.529
Obviously they exist which means obviously people are buying them and finding ways to work around some of the challenges be they

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:56.435
Ergonomic or be they practical like one of the things we noticed is if you're not using headphones

00:13:56.535 --> 00:14:00.239
You probably don't have a really great way to handle audio.

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:04.043
I don't know about speakers mounted to the edge of these monitors. They're kind of

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.579
wobbly enough as it is.

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:12.585
With that said I think Cluvens has got the most usable package I’ve seen so far.

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:16.021
So maybe it's time to get some impressions from the other members of the team.

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:20.059
Let's see who wants to swap out their existing station for this.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.796
How do you get in Jordan? Well, that's for you to figure out.

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:32.037
I feel like I'm in a dentist chair. Oh, that's the whole back. Oh, wow.

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:39.011
This keyboard’s got a little screen on it. It's kind of cute. What can you put on the screen?

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:40.779
It'll do like your

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:46.318
temperatures, your CPU use, whether you can put the animations and stuff with logo is.

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:48.120
So I can put memes? You can put memes on it.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.221
Hell yeah.

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:51.056
I'm actually kind of shocked at how comfortable this is

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:56.328
I thought this would be a lot weirder and not as enjoyable. I could play in this all day.

00:14:56.929 --> 00:15:01.066
But would you buy it? Well, how much does just the chair cost? I don't need the whole setup

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:08.874
The chair is $28.99 US plus shipping. I think that's totally reasonable. I would enjoy movies in this I think

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:11.377
And would you replace your workstation?

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:17.116
Oh yeah, easily. Oh, are you kidding me? Is that an actual option? We get to keep it.

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:18.784
Yeah

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:20.452
Okay that’s not cool.

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:22.788
Like cut my Achilles tendon.

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:27.092
Yeah, we're gaming now. It feels a little cramped to be honest.

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:28.327
I feel like it's a little

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:32.498
It's a little tilted. Yeah, it's a little crooked.

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:35.034
I have the go button all the way over there.

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:38.971
This is not the chairs fault the chair is actually pretty comfortable.

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:42.875
You really want to recline it or else your wrists kind of feel like they're getting a little cramped.

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:47.346
Would you pay for the chair yourself? I don't think I'd want to pay for this myself

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.983
Would you want it as your workstation? Oh, no, I'm good.

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:55.087
Wow pinnacle of luxury, hey?

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:56.922
I don't even know what to say. It's really unique.

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:59.024
I am really concerned though

00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:01.126
about how close we are to the monitor.

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:04.396
Because I think after like eight hours of a workday or playing or gaming all night

00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:05.731
it's gonna be pretty difficult.

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:08.300
Even my field of view can't even go from edge to edge

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.071
so I feel like I'm not getting the the most advantage out of it.

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:18.010
But super comfortable to be honest with you. I really like it. Could you imagine if I brought this home to my wife?

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.713
She would be so upset.

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:27.519
If I didn't care about budget and had the space for it, for sure. I'd probably rock it. Would I buy it?

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:30.489
Sure. Yeah, I'd do it

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:32.958
And would you use it as your workstation here?

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:35.494
Oh definitely. Oh, yeah.

00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:36.562
This is unexpected.

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:43.936
We have not one but two members of the team who would like to daily drive the Scorpion and the only fair way to

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:45.938
settle this I think is

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:46.772
RPS.

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:50.275
Rock-paper-scissors best two out of three. Okay, ready and go!

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:58.317
Oh you want me to do the whole- you want me to do all the work for you. Rock-paper-scissors shoot!

00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:58.917
Shoot.

00:16:59.385 --> 00:16:59.885
Shoot.

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:01.186
Shoot. Shoot.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.755
Oh, oh, we got one win.

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:03.489
Hit one!

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:04.223
No!

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:05.557
Rock-paper-scissors shoot!

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:07.526
Yes! Oh it’s one-one!

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.728
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:10.929
There it is!

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:14.133
Now we have to haul it upstairs.

00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:17.036
That's his problem. Not ours. Oh good. What?

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:18.904
No, we can get him some help. We'll get him some.

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:21.340
Elijah, we'll get you help. All right. I always need help.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.841
Are you serious? I actually have to?

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:24.676
Well, yeah, you said you wanted it.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:29.314
I thought it was more of just like a theoretical, but I’m still down.

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:36.955
Okay, maybe we'll do a Floatplane exclusive with Elijah's long-term impressions actually living with this thing day-to-day.

00:17:36.955 --> 00:17:40.059
Oh that's, oh yeah, I’m actually really excited.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:44.930
And I'm excited to tell you about our sponsor, oh wait, I already told you about our sponsor, this keyboards pretty sick.

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:46.732
Yeah, check it out. We're gonna have a link down below.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:52.905
If you guys enjoyed this video, why not check out the last one we got which was kind of like this concept but no motors.
