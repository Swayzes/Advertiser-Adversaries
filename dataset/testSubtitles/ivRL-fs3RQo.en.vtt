00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
Quick, look at this, and this, and this, and this.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.680
Did you notice anything?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.880
Only the last one was made by Razer.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.460
Here, let me slow it down.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.420
This, and this.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.040
That's no snake, it's a frog.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.560
And it also shows up here on the sick custom hang tag.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.440
And this shade of green, that ain't quite right either.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.440
But don't feel bad.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.220
When we first spotted these green and black box products

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.360
next to the checkout in the auto parts store,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.780
we didn't notice either.

00:00:28.784 --> 00:00:30.944
Wait, auto parts store?

00:00:30.944 --> 00:00:34.104
We're only 32 seconds into this video

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:37.884
and I have so many more questions than I did when I started.

00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:39.544
Guess I better clear my calendar.

00:00:41.284 --> 00:00:44.024
These screwdriver sharp gaming peripherals

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:45.784
are branded Dart Frog,

00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:49.464
but they're actually manufactured by CJ Global Inc.

00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:50.764
Who even is that, you ask?

00:00:50.764 --> 00:00:51.784
Well, based on their website,

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:54.848
they're everything to everyone.

00:00:54.848 --> 00:00:57.788
They're the refreshing touch of Mexican beer on your lips.

00:00:57.788 --> 00:01:00.168
The forgotten vanguard of American heroes.

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:02.608
The brave explorers of the final frontier.

00:01:03.588 --> 00:01:05.768
Okay, they're a bargain basement electronics manufacturer

00:01:05.768 --> 00:01:08.868
who appears to have made some pretty big brand deals.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:09.708
Good for them.

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:11.788
Frankly, I didn't realize the US Army

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:13.488
was so into merchandising.

00:01:13.488 --> 00:01:17.768
Now drop down and give me 20 segues to our sponsor, maggot!

00:01:17.768 --> 00:01:18.808
The Ridge.

00:01:18.808 --> 00:01:21.552
Upgrade your everyday carry with the Ridge wallet.

00:01:21.552 --> 00:01:28.692
Its RFID blocking technology protects your cards from digital
theft, while its durable materials ensure that it lasts for years to come.

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:34.192
Click the link below and use code "Linus" to save 10% on your
purchase and get free shipping.

00:01:35.192 --> 00:01:41.832
Hopping right in, Dart Frog's packaging is clearly designed to
piggyback on Razer's hard-earned reputation.

00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:48.252
But being a knock-off isn't necessarily a knock against a product,
as long as the price is right.

00:01:48.304 --> 00:01:52.824
And for what we paid for the Dart Frog M307 Laser Gaming Mouse,

00:01:52.824 --> 00:01:57.484
11 Freedom Dollars, we're prepared to overlook a few warts.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.884
The packaging feels more premium

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:00.524
than some real Razer products,

00:02:00.524 --> 00:02:03.704
and the specs, honestly, kind of appealing.

00:02:03.704 --> 00:02:08.464
Adjustable DPI at four levels, 500, 1200, 1600, and 2400.

00:02:08.464 --> 00:02:10.044
Why 500, not the standard 800?

00:02:10.044 --> 00:02:11.184
I don't know.

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:14.064
Ergonomic design, color-changing light,

00:02:14.064 --> 00:02:16.804
seven lights or seven colors?

00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:17.644
We don't know.

00:02:17.644 --> 00:02:18.176
We'll figure that out.

00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:20.236
And a braided one and a half meter cable.

00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:22.356
And in terms of the look and ergonomics,

00:02:22.356 --> 00:02:25.176
it is not that dissimilar to comparables

00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:27.476
from brands like Razer and Logitech.

00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:29.936
To be clear, there are some eyebrow razors here.

00:02:29.936 --> 00:02:32.756
Eight buttons with a fire key.

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:33.716
What's a fire key?

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:34.976
Left click?

00:02:34.976 --> 00:02:36.116
No?

00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:38.396
Oh, this.

00:02:38.396 --> 00:02:41.276
If it works anywhere near as well as the RGB, who knows?

00:02:41.276 --> 00:02:42.796
Maybe I'll be impressed.

00:02:42.796 --> 00:02:44.336
There it is, the first piece of our fart dog,

00:02:44.336 --> 00:02:46.736
I mean, dart frog gaming setup.

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:47.408
And next.

00:02:47.408 --> 00:02:52.408
We've got the K520 metal gaming keyboard for $22.

00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:53.448
I don't know about you guys,

00:02:53.448 --> 00:02:56.048
but I love it when the key specs on a product

00:02:56.048 --> 00:02:58.548
have no formatting and zero punctuation.

00:02:58.548 --> 00:03:01.048
Sorry, I mean, when they're ramblamatic.

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:03.588
Metal design, anti-ghosting USB plug

00:03:03.588 --> 00:03:06.288
and play specifications, colon,

00:03:06.288 --> 00:03:08.488
RGB LED backlight, five foot cable,

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.568
USB interface anti-ghosting.

00:03:11.848 --> 00:03:13.168
Sounds promising to me.

00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:16.724
Looks less promising.

00:03:18.724 --> 00:03:20.864
Feels even less promising.

00:03:20.864 --> 00:03:23.184
In fairness, there is metal involved,

00:03:23.184 --> 00:03:25.704
however flimsy it might be.

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:28.644
It's probably less flex in this t-shirt.

00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:30.204
LTTstore.com.

00:03:30.204 --> 00:03:31.444
But some of these other specs,

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:34.644
I just have no idea what they're talking about.

00:03:34.644 --> 00:03:37.524
Seven keys shortcuts, 12 buttons?

00:03:37.524 --> 00:03:38.684
What does that even mean?

00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:41.784
And why is there an Internet Explorer shortcut?

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:43.404
I guess you need it if you wanna be compatible

00:03:43.404 --> 00:03:45.844
with Windows XP all the way to Windows 10.

00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:47.804
Not 11, curiously.

00:03:47.804 --> 00:03:50.164
I guess you gotta draw the line somewhere, though.

00:03:50.164 --> 00:03:51.804
This'll go perfectly with my mouse.

00:03:51.804 --> 00:03:54.204
And look, an integrated phone holder.

00:03:55.404 --> 00:03:57.644
To round out our amphibious gaming setup,

00:03:57.644 --> 00:04:00.049
we've got the Dart Frog S142.

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.049
Computer gaming speakers with RGB LED lights for $11.

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.109
They feature three watt, two and a half inch drivers.

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.969
Are these even actually two and a half inch?

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:11.249
They're under two.

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:14.409
Frequency response down to 25 Hertz.

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.629
Strong doubt.

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.409
HD quality sound.

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.229
Oh boy, these guys.

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.489
I think probably their best feature looking at them

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.249
is gonna be that they make my hands look huge.

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.869
What does separation plus minus 40 decibels mean?

00:04:30.049 --> 00:04:30.889
I don't know.

00:04:32.034 --> 00:04:32.874
Yeah.

00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:34.754
The lack of an indicator for which is the right

00:04:34.754 --> 00:04:36.374
and which is the left channel,

00:04:36.374 --> 00:04:38.274
not to mention the USB power,

00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:39.974
I think tells me everything I need to know

00:04:39.974 --> 00:04:42.854
about the performance of these speakers.

00:04:42.854 --> 00:04:44.794
They do look kind of pretty though.

00:04:44.794 --> 00:04:47.974
And look at that built-in volume dial.

00:04:49.094 --> 00:04:50.894
Is it just me or does that seem to suggest

00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:52.994
that these were headphones at some point?

00:04:54.034 --> 00:04:54.874
Oh, wow.

00:04:54.874 --> 00:04:56.354
I am immediately doubting

00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:59.154
some of these very real user reviews.

00:04:59.154 --> 00:05:00.414
Linda9,

00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:04.076
I think you can go wrong with this mouse.

00:05:04.076 --> 00:05:06.356
Ergonomics are kind of a mess.

00:05:06.356 --> 00:05:08.476
You guys are gonna be feeding me some labs data for this.

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:10.236
Yes, we've got information on accuracy,

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:11.856
precision and latency.

00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:12.676
Oh, good.

00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:16.356
I'm just trying to click play

00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:18.816
and this is already a disaster.

00:05:18.816 --> 00:05:21.056
Took me three attempts.

00:05:21.056 --> 00:05:23.416
I clicked CS2 and apparently we're gonna play

00:05:23.416 --> 00:05:26.036
TAC FPS Micro Corrections Easy V2.

00:05:26.036 --> 00:05:26.976
My favorite.

00:05:27.312 --> 00:05:28.812
Easy, you say.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.040
It just feels a little bit off though.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.200
It actually doesn't feel that far off.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.120
They say that this is set at 500 DPI,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.100
but what we measured was actually closer

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.480
to the standard 800.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.180
It was around 700 DPI.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.660
So, you know, it's a-

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.160
Explains why it feels a little off.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.820
Yeah, just a little off.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.780
481.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.140
That's fantastic considering that this mouse

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.780
has a deviation that's about three times worse

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.033
than the cheapest mouse that Logitech makes.

00:06:00.033 --> 00:06:01.413
Ah, I see.

00:06:01.413 --> 00:06:04.713
So that's the consistency with which

00:06:04.713 --> 00:06:06.513
your motion will be interpreted.

00:06:06.513 --> 00:06:08.213
Should I try this with the Logitech mouse

00:06:08.213 --> 00:06:09.293
and see if I do any better?

00:06:09.293 --> 00:06:10.133
Sure.

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:12.053
Or give me a real razor.

00:06:12.053 --> 00:06:12.893
Do we have a real razor?

00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:14.973
Yeah, we have the DeathAdder V2,

00:06:14.973 --> 00:06:17.713
which is very similar to the Essentials,

00:06:17.713 --> 00:06:19.113
which is what will be our recommendation.

00:06:19.113 --> 00:06:21.633
It's slightly better than the Essential though.

00:06:21.633 --> 00:06:23.173
I don't know why I'm doing this to myself

00:06:23.173 --> 00:06:25.473
because realistically, oh God,

00:06:25.473 --> 00:06:26.993
this is not gonna be any better.

00:06:26.993 --> 00:06:28.873
Oh my God, it's definitely better.

00:06:28.873 --> 00:06:30.144
What'd I say I got last time?

00:06:30.144 --> 00:06:36.384
480, I think? Yeah, just about 480, I believe. Okay, to give you
guys some idea, I am

00:06:37.684 --> 00:06:40.024
halfway through and I'm at 305 now.

00:06:40.884 --> 00:06:41.904
565!

00:06:41.904 --> 00:06:48.224
Those precision numbers are especially bad when you consider that
we're comparing to a bad Logitech mouse. If we compare it to the 305,

00:06:48.224 --> 00:06:53.384
which is kind of where they start getting pretty good, it's a
factor of about 25 times worse.

00:06:55.984 --> 00:06:57.984
But

00:06:59.188 --> 00:07:01.008
But that doesn't mean every gaming mouse

00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:02.628
from the automotive shop is bad.

00:07:02.628 --> 00:07:03.608
While we were in line,

00:07:03.608 --> 00:07:07.228
we also picked up this tech theory gaming pack

00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:11.228
that promises to make you the gamer you always wanted to be.

00:07:11.228 --> 00:07:15.548
And oh my God, I think it's actually working.

00:07:17.848 --> 00:07:19.888
Anywho, the reason I bring this up

00:07:19.888 --> 00:07:22.868
is that the mouse is actually pretty interesting.

00:07:22.868 --> 00:07:26.768
And look, it even comes with a bonus LED light strip.

00:07:28.442 --> 00:07:31.382
It kind of left me to my own devices on this one.

00:07:31.382 --> 00:07:32.442
Here's the LED strip.

00:07:32.442 --> 00:07:35.762
It does have an IR receiver, can use with remote control,

00:07:35.762 --> 00:07:37.102
but it doesn't include a remote.

00:07:37.102 --> 00:07:39.122
So I guess I hope you like this.

00:07:39.122 --> 00:07:41.462
As for the mouse, there's not much in terms of specs.

00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:42.702
We got the cable length,

00:07:42.702 --> 00:07:47.702
which seems to be over-reported by 10 centimeters,

00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:50.962
which my wife tells me is a lot.

00:07:50.962 --> 00:07:53.402
And then the outer diameter?

00:07:53.402 --> 00:07:55.362
Sure, 2.6.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.140
It's RGB with a USC interface?

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.880
They mean USB-C?

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.060
Nope.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.200
It's type A.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.780
Maybe it was a type O.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.440
Oh! - Hey!

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.660
Okay, no, but what is helpful

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.020
is they actually indicate the sensor part number,

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.840
which gives us some unusual insight

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.280
into the costs of these bargain aisle peripherals.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.060
A quick Google search later indicates that it is 11 cents.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.760
I cannot wait to try this one.

00:08:24.016 --> 00:08:25.936
You wanna know how much that box costs?

00:08:25.936 --> 00:08:27.476
The box?

00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:29.476
Sure, how do you know?

00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:31.456
Online, 100 bucks.

00:08:31.456 --> 00:08:34.076
We got it for 40, so we got it for a discount.

00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:36.036
It's one of those products that I think

00:08:36.036 --> 00:08:39.576
the price that's reported online isn't the real one,

00:08:39.576 --> 00:08:40.816
but even 40.

00:08:40.816 --> 00:08:43.356
Is that not the cheapest feeling mouse

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.736
you've ever held in your hand?

00:08:44.736 --> 00:08:46.516
It's definitely cheaper feeling,

00:08:46.516 --> 00:08:49.316
but the movement doesn't feel much worse than the Dart Frog.

00:08:49.316 --> 00:08:51.216
Maybe it's just the weight.

00:08:51.216 --> 00:08:53.936
It's a lot easier to move 'cause it weighs

00:08:53.936 --> 00:08:55.696
nothing. - Yeah.

00:08:55.696 --> 00:08:57.916
We tested it against the Dart Frog

00:08:57.916 --> 00:09:00.556
and it's about seven times less precise.

00:09:00.556 --> 00:09:04.156
That's bad 'cause the Dart Frog's already horrible.

00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:06.936
And so maybe the lightness does counteract

00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:09.556
the impreciseness of it.

00:09:09.556 --> 00:09:10.696
Numbers don't lie, dude.

00:09:10.696 --> 00:09:14.216
I am smack in between the Dart Frog and the Razor.

00:09:14.216 --> 00:09:16.556
That might be that in spite of its precision issues,

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.636
it's actually closer to the standard 800 DPI.

00:09:19.636 --> 00:09:22.576
Right, or it's super light,

00:09:22.576 --> 00:09:23.968
which makes it feel cheap.

00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:27.568
But is also an advantage when you're making micro-adjustments.

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.708
But hey, that's just a theory.

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:31.908
Too soon?

00:09:31.908 --> 00:09:33.308
Yeah, sorry.

00:09:33.308 --> 00:09:34.628
I miss 'em too.

00:09:34.628 --> 00:09:36.888
I think it's time to move on to our Dart Frog keyboard.

00:09:36.888 --> 00:09:38.848
The very real user reviews for this one

00:09:38.848 --> 00:09:40.968
include this gem from Margaret.

00:09:40.968 --> 00:09:43.588
It lights up, making the gaming more entertaining.

00:09:44.908 --> 00:09:45.928
All right.

00:09:45.928 --> 00:09:48.908
I personally find that this RGB strip contributes more

00:09:48.908 --> 00:09:50.448
to my Typing of the Dead experience

00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:51.628
than the lights on my keyboard,

00:09:51.628 --> 00:09:53.068
but you do you, Margaret.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.360
Did you guys bring a real keyboard for me to try as well?

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:02.360
I was just thinking about that. We have the Razer membrane one, but
it might be nice to have like an actual mechanical keyboard.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.360
Look how much flex there is in this thing.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.360
It's part of the feature. It's ergonomic.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.360
This is unbelievable.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:17.360
Surprising to me, the latency on both the Dart Frog and the Tech
Theory was actually lower than similarly priced Razer and Logitech accessories,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.360
but it's all within a factor of a few milliseconds, so it's all
kind of bad.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.720
You're doing good.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.060
Zombie's dying.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.460
He's really concentrating.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.120
I love how called out Redditors are.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.960
In this?

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.620
Is monkey type their thing?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.240
It's more the words.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.080
Mm, oh.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.800
Like eat the rich.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.640
Oh, heck yeah.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.460
Just like, no, that wasn't in there,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.440
but that kind of stuff.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.040
Just like typical Redditor, you know?

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.752
Oh, I love it.

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.852
Do you want to try the same thing on a good keyboard?

00:10:55.852 --> 00:10:57.332
Yeah, let's do that. - At least a decent one.

00:10:57.332 --> 00:10:58.172
Ooh, ooh.

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:02.212
Hey, at least I can feel where the home row is.

00:11:02.212 --> 00:11:03.632
That's a plus. - Yeah.

00:11:03.632 --> 00:11:04.452
Karma bites.

00:11:04.452 --> 00:11:05.592
See, that's what I'm talking about.

00:11:05.592 --> 00:11:06.512
Orwellian.

00:11:06.512 --> 00:11:08.632
So tired.

00:11:08.632 --> 00:11:10.532
Nothingness.

00:11:10.532 --> 00:11:12.172
I'm not a very focused person.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.452
I find this actually very difficult to do,

00:11:14.452 --> 00:11:15.752
but I think that was better.

00:11:15.752 --> 00:11:16.272
Oh yeah.

00:11:16.272 --> 00:11:18.412
Yeah, like 20% better.

00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:21.392
So a better keyboard is better.

00:11:21.392 --> 00:11:22.232
Riveting.

00:11:22.232 --> 00:11:24.152
Next it calls for me to test out the speakers,

00:11:24.152 --> 00:11:25.592
but Jordan. - Yeah.

00:11:25.592 --> 00:11:27.112
You were saying they weren't plugged in,

00:11:27.112 --> 00:11:29.032
but they show up as USB speakers.

00:11:29.032 --> 00:11:29.872
I plugged it in.

00:11:32.072 --> 00:11:33.452
Wow. - Yeah, that's a speaker, right?

00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:35.172
That's terrible.

00:11:35.172 --> 00:11:36.512
You know what?

00:11:36.512 --> 00:11:40.732
For 11 bucks, fine, sure.

00:11:40.732 --> 00:11:42.452
They got RGB.

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:44.032
Let's win this match, here we go.

00:11:44.032 --> 00:11:45.252
Team Cobra.

00:11:45.936 --> 00:11:48.476
Oh my God, this mouse is so bad.

00:11:48.476 --> 00:11:51.096
I didn't realize how bad it was.

00:11:51.096 --> 00:11:52.456
It's so bad.

00:11:52.456 --> 00:11:54.316
Did you see it just lose tracking there?

00:11:54.316 --> 00:11:55.516
Yeah, do a big swing.

00:11:55.516 --> 00:11:57.216
No, I can't, I can't.

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.996
Look at this.

00:11:58.996 --> 00:12:01.396
Are you seeing this? - Wow.

00:12:01.396 --> 00:12:05.096
Okay, wait, was that in the lab results that it can't?

00:12:05.096 --> 00:12:05.936
No.

00:12:05.936 --> 00:12:08.716
That the max tracking speed is like zero?

00:12:09.184 --> 00:12:10.404
You know what?

00:12:10.404 --> 00:12:13.624
The Linus vibe is still a valid measure, dude.

00:12:13.624 --> 00:12:15.084
Can I have that lightweight one?

00:12:15.084 --> 00:12:15.924
The other crappy one?

00:12:15.924 --> 00:12:16.744
Yep.

00:12:18.424 --> 00:12:19.264
Oh my God.

00:12:19.264 --> 00:12:21.004
This one's almost as bad.

00:12:21.004 --> 00:12:24.584
Just completely loses it.

00:12:24.584 --> 00:12:27.384
I can't turn around!

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:35.232
Okay, you want to try the cheap Logitech one? Just to see. It's
gonna be bad too.

00:12:35.232 --> 00:12:41.232
It's way better. Oh it's way better? It's bad. Yeah. But it's way
better. Like it

00:12:41.232 --> 00:12:46.152
still it still does lose tracking sometimes but oh no it's really
bad. You

00:12:46.152 --> 00:12:51.652
know what? The speakers are far from my biggest problem. They seem
pretty fine

00:12:51.652 --> 00:12:56.232
other than that I assumed the one with the label would be the right
channel. I

00:12:56.232 --> 00:13:00.072
think it's actually the left. I would do anything to stop using
this mouse right now.

00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:03.192
Well you're in luck. We have the cheapest peripheral of the
entire day ready for you Linus. 

00:13:03.192 --> 00:13:07.992
Oh good wireless mouse D09. This is really

00:13:07.992 --> 00:13:15.072
laggy like you said but it just outright loses my tracking far less
often. Still

00:13:15.072 --> 00:13:19.272
not great but actually usable. A little more on that later. For now
let's go back

00:13:19.272 --> 00:13:25.032
to the speakers where come on you guys all knew this was coming.
What is it? I can't even do it.

00:13:25.032 --> 00:13:26.032
Like the peanuts thing.

00:13:26.232 --> 00:13:28.232
Oh yeah yeah.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:35.190
You know, given my expectations, not bad for $11.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.770
Like, I'm sitting, I was going into this thinking, I'm going to be
like King Hamlet.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.590
What?

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.630
Frogs and poison, like poison in the ears from the...

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.050
Ah.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.410
What? You want current pop culture references? Come on.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.656
Something to keep in mind in all of this

00:13:53.656 --> 00:13:56.576
is that the prices we paid for these peripherals,

00:13:56.576 --> 00:14:00.156
it's not that easy to find better products.

00:14:00.156 --> 00:14:02.576
I mean, a Big Mac meal at McDonald's

00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:06.436
costs more than this mouse in most of America.

00:14:06.436 --> 00:14:10.156
But don't mistake that for a recommendation for the mouse,

00:14:10.156 --> 00:14:12.476
or actually the burger for that matter.

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:13.576
It's not.

00:14:13.576 --> 00:14:15.836
Products like this suck.

00:14:15.836 --> 00:14:18.556
And in my opinion, they just shouldn't even be made.

00:14:18.556 --> 00:14:19.396
To be clear.

00:14:19.456 --> 00:14:22.736
I also have no problem with budget peripherals.

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:25.036
The speakers, totally usable.

00:14:25.036 --> 00:14:28.836
And the Eastern times mouse that I highlighted earlier,

00:14:28.836 --> 00:14:30.896
which was also at the auto store,

00:14:30.896 --> 00:14:33.496
in spite of its supremely generic packaging

00:14:33.496 --> 00:14:35.496
and underwhelming product specs,

00:14:35.496 --> 00:14:38.536
actually performed decently well for what it is.

00:14:38.536 --> 00:14:43.536
A AA powered wireless utility mouse.

00:14:43.596 --> 00:14:44.992
And it's just $9.

00:14:44.992 --> 00:14:51.392
Which illustrates why I find Dart Frog's offerings, especially this
mouse, so offensive.

00:14:51.392 --> 00:14:58.192
They don't need to be this bad. Maybe a 12 cent sensor and another
nickel in plastics could have

00:14:58.192 --> 00:15:04.112
been all the upgrade that it needed to be usable. Of course, my
real recommendation is to wait for

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:08.192
your next payday and pick up something from a brand that is likely
to still exist by the

00:15:08.192 --> 00:15:12.032
time you make it through the checkout. You know, just in case you
need warranty support.

00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:15.456
At the MSRPs of the products that we looked at today,

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.556
there are some very decent options.

00:15:17.556 --> 00:15:20.736
The Razer DeathAdder Essential or the Logitech 203

00:15:20.736 --> 00:15:23.556
are both available for about $30.

00:15:23.556 --> 00:15:26.476
And both of them are much better than any of the mice

00:15:26.476 --> 00:15:27.416
that we just looked at.

00:15:27.416 --> 00:15:28.796
In terms of keyboards,

00:15:28.796 --> 00:15:30.976
I know we've memed on Red Dragon in the past,

00:15:30.976 --> 00:15:31.996
but they've upped their game

00:15:31.996 --> 00:15:34.176
and they now make pretty decent mechanical

00:15:34.176 --> 00:15:37.276
hot swappable keyboards for less than 40 bucks.

00:15:37.276 --> 00:15:38.696
We're gonna have links to our suggestions

00:15:38.696 --> 00:15:39.916
in the video description,

00:15:39.916 --> 00:15:42.036
because in our opinion, the premium is

00:15:42.048 --> 00:15:45.648
well worth it for something that you might be touching for hours a
day.

00:15:45.648 --> 00:15:50.048
And don't forget, guys, that if that's not an option for you
because you're on a tight budget,

00:15:50.048 --> 00:15:56.048
secondhand is a great way to go. Just remember to test everything
you buy before you walk away.

00:15:56.048 --> 00:15:59.328
Just like I'm going to walk away from this segue to our sponsor.
