00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.500
- [Jimmy] This is a real prison

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.600
and me and the boys are
gonna try to survive

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.910
the next 50 hours locked up here.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.806
- Get in here,

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:07.639
put your hands against the wall.

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:08.472
- There against the wall.

00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:10.650
I'm just gonna do what he says.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.080
I am officially locked
in prison with Nolan.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.913
How's it going?

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:14.746
- Not good.

00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:17.430
- Basically me, Nolan and
all my other friends agreed

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.380
to spend 50 hours in prison.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.310
How's it going, boys?

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.660
- I feel right at home.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.500
- Just so we're clear.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.900
We are gonna be treated
exactly like inmates.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.970
Okay, we're gonna be
eating real prison food.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.920
We're gonna have to mop
and clean the prison

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.500
and all around subjected
to the mental warfare

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.730
that is being a prisoner.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.900
I hope you guys are ready.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.330
First thoughts on my brand new
bed, it's very uncomfortable.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.530
These sheets, oddly feel like...

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.427
Hey, get your foot off my bed.
(Nolan giggling)

00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:40.290
(Jimmy groans)

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.390
49 hours and 55 minutes to go

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.388
and I'm already sick of him.

00:00:43.388 --> 00:00:44.610
- What?
(Jimmy laughs)

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.470
- I would like to discuss the toilets.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.310
What are your thoughts on them?

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.650
- I'm not gonna lie, mine
has like a yellow tint to it.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.730
- That's what I was about to ask.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.830
Now that we've established,
the toilets are disgusting.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.015
Let's all taste test the fountain.

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:56.130
(Jimmy grunts)

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.000
There was something in it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.881
Look at all that stuff.

00:00:57.881 --> 00:00:59.430
I'm just not gonna drink water.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.263
I'll just die.

00:01:00.263 --> 00:01:02.340
(clock ticking)

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.434
- Last name, inmate.

00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:04.890
- Weddle.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.150
- Doyon. (Zealous chuckles)

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.680
- What kind of last name is that?

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.360
- I'm French-Canadian, all right.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.193
- My last name?

00:01:10.193 --> 00:01:11.026
- Yes.

00:01:11.026 --> 00:01:11.859
- Imagine dragon.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:12.750
- I'm gonna back up.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.519
- Imagine dragon theses
nuts, on your face.

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:17.399
(inmates laughing)

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:18.603
- I'll be back for you guys.
(Nolan laughing)

00:01:18.603 --> 00:01:20.790
- Hey, it's him, I'm not doing it.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.320
- I'm not scared, come get us.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.153
Get him too.

00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:24.360
- Lights out.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.740
- Do we have to get in our bunk?

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.660
- Lights out, get in your bunk.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.160
- About to spend the night in prison.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.480
It feels like I took a blanket

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.160
and just laid it in
the middle of the road.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.090
This is gonna suck.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.160
It's currently 3:00 a.m. and in prison,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.290
the guards do roll call
in the middle of the night

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.281
to make sure no prisoners escaped.

00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:41.246
(alarm wailing)

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:42.507
- Roll call!

00:01:42.507 --> 00:01:43.813
State your name.

00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:44.646
- [Noah] Noah.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:45.479
- [Guard] State your name.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.860
- [Jimmy] Jimmy.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.993
- Nolan.

00:01:47.993 --> 00:01:49.080
(head bumps)
(Nolan grunts)

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.250
- [Jimmy] Did you just hit your head?

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.810
- Have a good night ladies.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.820
I'll see you guys in the morning.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.890
- Wake up ladies.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.450
Five minutes, get out of bed.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.620
Dress, ready to go.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.670
- Slept like a baby.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.830
If the baby got hit by a truck
in the middle of the night.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.390
- These things are constricting.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.440
- [Guard] Over here, face to the wall.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.230
- I feel like I actually
did something illegal now.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.090
Oh, this is hard, okay.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.470
Oh, is this the kitchen?

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.340
What's that?

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.810
- Food.
- Okay.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.870
This is my first prison meal.
(suspense music)

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.703
Not bad.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:17.970
I give the meal a four out of 10.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.260
Raise your hand if you're glad

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.910
you're at least not in your cell.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.280
He's a psychopath.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.507
- Yeah, I couldn't sleep last night

00:02:24.507 --> 00:02:26.445
and this wasn't worth waking up for.

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.223
(upbeat music)

00:02:28.223 --> 00:02:30.433
- And we're back to the
cells, that was a journey.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.490
(clock ticking)

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.685
- Shower time.

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:34.740
(inmates whooping)

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.360
- [Zealous] Why does he
have latex gloves on?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.560
- It's for the cavity search.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.150
- I've never taken a prison shower before.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.370
- [Guard] Towel,
underwear, shirt and soap.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.660
You have 10 minutes.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.493
- Ooh.

00:02:43.493 --> 00:02:44.326
- So they're letting us take showers now

00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:45.720
but there's no hot water.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.550
That really seems like torture to me.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.383
- Brush teeth.

00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:49.888
- What kind of sorry excuse-
- I had too many stabbings

00:02:49.888 --> 00:02:51.570
with toothbrushes.
- of a toothbrush is this?

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.403
- Stabbings?

00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:54.090
What kind of prison is this?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.530
How am I supposed to brush my teeth?

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.550
I'm gonna get a cavity.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.230
- Inmate coming out of shower.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.490
Inmate out of shower.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.323
- [Jimmy] What's on your finger?

00:03:00.323 --> 00:03:02.220
- This is a toothbrush,
look at this thing.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.053
- [Jimmy] Oh really?

00:03:03.053 --> 00:03:03.886
- [Nolan] What is this?
- Oh,

00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:04.838
I dropped soap.

00:03:04.838 --> 00:03:06.134
(all laughs)
That wasn't on purpose.

00:03:06.134 --> 00:03:07.530
Hey fellow inmates,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.887
we have officially survived
10 hours in prison.

00:03:10.887 --> 00:03:12.900
(inmates cheering)

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.400
- [Jimmy] We were all just taking naps

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.560
and relaxing peacefully in ourselves,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.670
and then this happened.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.690
- Rec time!

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.523
Come on up.

00:03:19.523 --> 00:03:20.356
Get up.

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:22.530
(metal clanking)
Wake up, wake up!

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.730
- Looks like it's time for rec.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.220
All right, let's see what
we're dealing with here.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.780
A crappy chessboard.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.650
We've got a nice TV and we
have a beautiful library here.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.441
Does everyone here know
how to play poker, yeah?

00:03:33.441 --> 00:03:34.274
- Yes.

00:03:34.274 --> 00:03:36.420
- You guys wanna wager something on game?

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.253
- [Zealous] I have nothing.

00:03:37.253 --> 00:03:38.250
- [Jake] I have no money.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.020
- [Jimmy] While, we were
having fun playing cards.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.750
The other inmates got jealous
and tried to start a riot.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.940
- It feels like y'all
been in there forever.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.990
- [Neil] I swear Chris.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.823
- [Darren] Yeah, let's go.

00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:48.150
- It's already been an hour,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.770
there's no way it hasn't been an hour.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.242
- [Jimmy] Hey, we're just having fun.

00:03:51.242 --> 00:03:52.609
- Let us out!

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.940
(inmates grunting and screaming)

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.710
- It's been like 12 hours
and already is upset.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.543
- [Darren] Hey,

00:03:59.543 --> 00:04:01.410
we got a little bit of a
plumbing issue over here.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.700
- [Jimmy] Darren, what did you do?

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.350
- You made us do it, man.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.273
- To your cell, to your cell.

00:04:05.273 --> 00:04:07.020
- They're not letting us out.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.670
They're showing favoritism over here.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.503
- You were next.

00:04:09.503 --> 00:04:11.130
- Yeah, got tired of waiting man.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.321
- These guys tried to
literally flood the prison

00:04:13.321 --> 00:04:15.600
and then get mad when they get cuffed.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.740
- [Neil] This prison sucks.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.330
- [Jimmy] I think you
should put them in solitary.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.163
- [Neil] Jimmy!

00:04:19.163 --> 00:04:22.140
- I want this floor to be
eaten off by time you're done.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.390
- [Jimmy] You can't even mop
'cause you're in shackles.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.320
That looks horrible.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.450
- Good behavior leads to good rec time.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.980
Bad behavior leads to this.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.110
- I woke up for rec and nobody's in here.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.190
You know, everybody got in trouble

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.620
so I guess I'm just gonna
look at pictures and books.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.060
- [Jimmy] Nolan and I woke up to learn

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.380
that we're on kitchen duty

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.540
which means we had to
make food for everybody.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.373
- Here we go.

00:04:40.373 --> 00:04:41.970
Oh, we get cosmic brownies.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.806
- I love prison.

00:04:42.806 --> 00:04:45.473
(intense music)

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.180
Is that the cell mates?

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.013
- Jimmy, you cooked?

00:04:49.013 --> 00:04:49.980
- Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.120
We have tons of beans.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.280
Everyone here is getting lots of beans.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.230
Wait, how many beans are you putting on?

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.430
- [Nolan] Darren was hungry!

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.600
- [Guard] All right, let's get moving.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.500
- I asked for no mayo.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.557
- [Jimmy] We sat down to eat
our very bland prison meal.

00:05:00.557 --> 00:05:02.460
And at this point we were so bored

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.620
that we started gambling our brownies.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.690
- [Jake] I already got nine pair.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.132
- [Jimmy] Oh, give me a
10 and I got a straight.

00:05:08.132 --> 00:05:09.686
(Chris clapping)

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:11.340
(inmates cheering)

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.420
So this is my brownie.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.530
- This is ring!

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.090
- I just won so many brownies.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.459
- [Guard] Inmates line up.

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:17.946
(upbeat music)

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:21.173
(bell dings)

00:05:21.173 --> 00:05:22.800
- Inmates line up!

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.510
Hit the wall, face the wall.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.560
- We're getting cuffed up again.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.270
I assume that's normal
every time we leave.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.950
- [Guard] All right,
we're doing cell checks.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.150
- What does the cell check mean?

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.540
- We are searching your
bunks to find any contraband.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.060
So anything we find will be a ride up

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.850
and possibly solitary
depending on what it is.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.470
- We've only been here for 20 hours.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.350
What's the worst they could
possibly have in their cells?

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.220
- What is that?

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.320
Nolan got a knife!

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.910
- It was only for protection.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.487
- I think you should search his butt.

00:05:49.487 --> 00:05:51.600
- No! Not my butt.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.098
- He's going to solitary.

00:05:53.098 --> 00:05:56.370
(suspense music)

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.680
- Take me back, let me go outside.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.630
- [Guard] Since you guys
were so well behaved,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.650
you get to go outside.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.080
- Now we get some time
outside in the courtyard.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.420
There's an outdoor basketball
court, but it's raining.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.253
Lovely.

00:06:07.253 --> 00:06:08.430
All right, who wants to play basketball?

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.480
- Guards against inmates?

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.313
Three on three.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.323
Oh!
- [Guard] Let's go.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.243
- Okay.

00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:16.170
Let's just say the guards
were talking a little smack

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.700
while we were playing some basketball.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.115
Turns out they were
better than we thought.

00:06:20.115 --> 00:06:21.390
(guards whooping)

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.040
- Looks like we gotta
head back to our cells.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.140
I love how our stuff is still
at the front of the cells

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.973
from the search.

00:06:25.973 --> 00:06:27.240
Our mattresses, what?

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.073
I mean,

00:06:28.073 --> 00:06:30.120
is it necessary to lead the
mattress flipped on its side?

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.500
I feel like the objective of prison

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.760
is to make you feel like an animal.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.680
Since Nolan's in solitary confinement,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.790
I could steal his pillow.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.020
I get two pillows.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.250
You hear that?
(cricket chirping)

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.480
It's silence.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.405
It's so nice having Nolan gone.

00:06:41.405 --> 00:06:44.040
(Nolan screaming)

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.873
I'd take it back.

00:06:44.873 --> 00:06:46.890
Meanwhile, Weddle and
Zealous were on cooking duty

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.791
when they heard this.

00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:48.960
(Nolan screaming in the distance)

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.063
- Oh, that Nolan?

00:06:50.063 --> 00:06:51.491
(Nolan screaming in the distance)

00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:53.352
- Hey Nolan, how's it going man?

00:06:53.352 --> 00:06:54.960
- Open this door.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.370
- It was time for our next meal

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.170
and I guess the guards
are feeling generous

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.900
because they let Nolan out of
solitary to come eat with us.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.733
Bund me up.

00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:02.566
- Yes, sir.

00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:03.540
- All right.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.620
- I'm so excited.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.480
- [Darren] We're hungry scoop faster.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.130
- We've been through a lot in prison.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.090
Wouldn't you guys say?

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.222
- Some more the most?

00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:11.250
- Yeah.
(inmates chuckling)

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.960
Surprisingly, I saw one
of their phone screens

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.880
and noticed we're not even 24 hours in.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.500
- [All] Really? Are you serious?

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.390
- It just felt like four days, I swear.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.260
- It really does.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.370
- [Jimmy] So Neil, why
you guys are wrestling?

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.810
- We're in prison, this
is what prisoners do.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.370
Three, two, go!

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.163
(Neil screaming)

00:07:25.163 --> 00:07:27.060
- It's so fast. (Neil screaming)

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.890
- Let's do Noah versus Weddle and Nolan.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.723
- [Chris] And Nolan, let's go.

00:07:29.723 --> 00:07:31.061
- [Jake] Let's go!

00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:33.879
- Whichever side wins,
I'll give them five grand.

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:34.980
(inmates sighs)

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:35.970
Five grand on the line.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.530
Three, two.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.363
- Oh God, oh God.

00:07:38.363 --> 00:07:39.196
- One, go!

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:40.238
(inmates grunting)

00:07:40.238 --> 00:07:41.497
(inmates screaming)

00:07:41.497 --> 00:07:42.420
- That was so fast!

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.740
- Hey, do you wanna do double or nothing

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.573
against the big guy?

00:07:44.573 --> 00:07:45.690
- Sure.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.740
- Oh! go get him! Go get him.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.970
He looks bigger than I remember.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.133
Three, two, one, go!

00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:54.088
(inmates shouting)

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:58.110
Inmates, inmates!

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.460
I'll pay you when I get out of jail.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.710
- [Guard] Back to your cells.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.720
(upbeat techno music)

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.490
(bell dings)

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.560
Wake up! It's yard time.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.510
Everybody line up outside your cell.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.900
- Every time I finally fall
asleep, I get woken up.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.430
I'm so sick of this place.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.870
We were so bored out of our mind

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.840
and even though this is just
a tiny cube of grass outside,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.670
it was a massive blessing.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.503
That's a goal!

00:08:21.503 --> 00:08:23.520
Hey, that's a goal, that's a goal.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.353
Header.

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:26.220
(inmates shouting)

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.090
- And that's the game.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.670
- For a second out there,
I forgot I was a prisoner.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.610
The outside courtyard with a
grass feels very liberating.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.327
It's my turn to shower and I'm free.

00:08:34.327 --> 00:08:36.600
(video game music)

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.940
Oh my gosh, I feel so much better now.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.110
I'm literally about to cry.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.943
Here's the problem,

00:08:40.943 --> 00:08:42.540
in prison they strip
everything away from you.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.450
So even something as simple as
hot water for a few minutes,

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.385
literally changes the
course of your whole day.

00:08:47.385 --> 00:08:49.740
(bell dings)

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.416
Gentlemen, we have less than
10 hours left in this dump.

00:08:53.416 --> 00:08:54.630
(inmates cheering)

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.390
In prison the only way you
can see your family or friends

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.620
is through visitation.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.880
- Mom, dad?

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.860
- Nolan, Nolan, what have you done?

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.249
- We raised you better than this.

00:09:03.249 --> 00:09:05.700
- I don't need to follow
no rules, I'm in prison.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.780
I run this place.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.270
- You will behave the rest of
the time that you're in here.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.120
- Listen, I might escape.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.180
- No.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.265
- [Guard] Time's up, let's

00:09:13.265 --> 00:09:14.598
- Hey, hey, mom!

00:09:16.057 --> 00:09:17.682
- [Jimmy] Chris has a visitor.

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:18.515
- Come on, come on, come on.

00:09:18.515 --> 00:09:19.800
Just hurry up, hurry up!

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.676
I wanna see him.

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:22.613
- Look up, there's daddy.

00:09:22.613 --> 00:09:23.499
- Hey little man.

00:09:23.499 --> 00:09:25.332
- Look, there's daddy.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.398
- I wish I could hold you buddy.

00:09:28.398 --> 00:09:29.943
(baby crying)
- Hey, visitation's over.

00:09:29.943 --> 00:09:32.212
- No, I just got to see my son.

00:09:32.212 --> 00:09:33.443
He's so cute, look at him.

00:09:33.443 --> 00:09:34.410
- Time to go.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.340
- Well, everyone else

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.350
was having loved ones
visit them in prison.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.910
I paid a lawyer to come visit me

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.680
and told him nothing about why.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.550
How's it going?

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.100
- Good Jimmy, what's going on?

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.780
- Well, I just wanted to make sure

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.030
that they knew I did nothing wrong.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.153
- Okay, but why would they
put you in prison though?

00:09:50.153 --> 00:09:53.400
- I'm here for a video I'm
spending 50 hours in prison.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.230
- You can spend 50 hours in prison

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.940
but I'm here to help you get out.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.200
- Well, I don't wanna get out.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.060
- Okay, not sure I understand.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.500
Am I still getting paid for this?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.430
- Of course.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.380
- Okay cool, have a good day.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.510
Don't worry, boys, I talked to a lawyer.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.910
Things make much more sense, now.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.900
- He wants to be in there

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.150
but I'm an attorney trying to get him out.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.120
It doesn't make any sense.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.094
(clock ticking)

00:10:16.094 --> 00:10:17.217
- I'm so tired.

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:19.920
I can't stay in this place
anymore, I might try to escape.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.940
- [Jimmy] I'm gonna be honest guys.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.610
This prison food gets bland really fast.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.477
I'm only in here for two days

00:10:24.477 --> 00:10:27.420
and I couldn't imagine
living years in prison.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.421
Gentlemen, do you know
what's in front of you?

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:30.300
- [Inmates] Wieners.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.486
- No, your last meal in prison.

00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:35.370
Round of applause.
(inmates applauding)

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.130
Also prison might come across
a lot more fun in this video

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.120
than it actually is.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.590
Let me assure you it's not fun.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.420
We're just idiots that can
make anything look fun.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.253
Don't go to jail.

00:10:43.253 --> 00:10:44.086
(clock ticking)
- [Chris] Last meal was good,

00:10:44.086 --> 00:10:45.973
but I'm not gonna miss this place.

00:10:45.973 --> 00:10:48.060
(somber music)

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.081
- [Nolan] I'm getting out of here.

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:50.991
(intense music)
(guards shouting)

00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:51.824
- On the ground! On the ground!

00:10:54.452 --> 00:10:56.869
On the ground! On the ground!

00:10:58.918 --> 00:11:00.311
(Nolan screaming)

00:11:00.311 --> 00:11:01.374
- [Nolan] You can't me!

00:11:01.374 --> 00:11:02.862
- Hands on the back.

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:04.988
- There's the exit!

00:11:04.988 --> 00:11:09.523
No it's locked! It's
locked! (Nolan screaming)

00:11:09.523 --> 00:11:10.627
- On the ground!

00:11:10.627 --> 00:11:12.090
Hands on your back.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.200
- I'm glad you found me.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.840
- I was actually lost, I
got lost from the group.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.860
- Nolan booked it.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.300
- There's like three hours left.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.133
What's going on?

00:11:19.133 --> 00:11:21.696
- Let's come down boys,
pineapple that's my save word.

00:11:21.696 --> 00:11:22.654
Pineapple.

00:11:22.654 --> 00:11:24.540
That's tight, that's real tight.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.160
- We're going to your cells,
I'm gonna help you out.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:26.993
- Okay.

00:11:26.993 --> 00:11:29.127
Wait, this is hard.
(inmates laughing)

00:11:29.127 --> 00:11:29.960
Oh, that hurt.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.010
- Hey, let's talk about this.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.450
Come on, no!

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.960
No, at least take the
handcuffs off at least.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.970
- Like if he ran away
yesterday makes sense,

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.530
but we have like three hours left.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.370
What's the point?

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.840
Probably the weirdest
thing I've ever done.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.095
Nolan, you caused me to have to do this.

00:11:45.095 --> 00:11:47.640
(clock ticking)

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.025
It's the home stretch, one
hour and I'm out of here.

00:11:50.025 --> 00:11:52.320
(clock ticking)

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.250
Inmates!

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.090
- [Inmates] Yeah?

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:57.256
- We officially have less
than 30 minutes remaining.

00:11:57.256 --> 00:11:59.430
(inmates cheering)

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.130
Our friend Nolan is still
in solitary confinement.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:02.963
Let's salute him.

00:12:02.963 --> 00:12:04.822
(trumpets music)

00:12:04.822 --> 00:12:05.655
- [Inmates] Five, four, three, two, one.

00:12:09.885 --> 00:12:12.629
(inmates cheering)

00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:14.750
(Jimmy clapping)

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:19.750
(inmates cheering)
(triumphant music)

00:12:24.295 --> 00:12:27.045
(man vocalizing)

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.503
- Hello?

00:12:31.113 --> 00:12:35.326
Hello?
(bomb exploding)
