00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Apple's latest Mac Pro is an embarrassment.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.840
It doesn't even have their latest gen M3 Silicon.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.480
It costs $3,400 more than a Mac Studio

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.440
that has the exact same specs.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.560
And their prices on storage and RAM upgrades

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.920
would seem to suggest that they're made out of gold

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.440
rather than Silicon.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.300
The worst part though, it's not even that good.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.220
Yeah, here we go.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.680
Final scores, 3000 and change, 1900 and change.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.960
Wow, wow, 50% faster on CPU.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.040
But showing you all the results right away

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.300
is no fun and not very helpful.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.180
So let's talk about our choices

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.120
while we work together to build the PC Pro 2.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.040
Yeah, if you remember,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.160
this isn't the first time we've done this.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.600
And last time, the PC wasn't a clear winner,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.080
unlike our sponsor, MSI.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.040
If you don't have time to go through the process

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.640
of picking out parts and building your own PC,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.000
MSI's Aegis RS Gaming Desktop

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.440
comes pre-built with powerful components

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.440
like a Wi-Fi 7 enabled motherboard,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.880
and it has the benefit of being easily upgradable.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.860
Check it out at the link down below.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.700
Right out of the gate,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.800
this PC Pro build is gonna be a bit more of a challenge.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.800
While our Mac Pro comes in at a whopping $11,800,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.160
the old one was like $30,000.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.520
So, bargain?

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.760
Well, it all depends on what you're getting, right?

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.560
There are two different M2 Ultras,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.560
one with 60 GPU cores and the other with 76.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.440
We've gone with the latter,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.440
meaning that that machine is as fast as it can be.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.560
Meanwhile, the PC Pro is getting something a little,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.840
I don't know, newer, faster, wider?

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.220
How about all of the above?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.800
The AMD Threadripper 7970X

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.060
features AMD's latest Zen 4 architecture

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.120
with a monstrous 32 cores

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.200
and a boost clock of 5.3 gigahertz,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.640
all while drawing 350 watts.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.920
And that's before you turn on PBO

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.880
or precision boost overdrive.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.720
More on that later,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.520
but there's a potential drawback of our machine

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.520
compared to that one.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.840
This isn't a top of the line Threadripper or anything.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.920
That would have cost us

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.440
more than half of our budget by itself.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.720
But I'm still confident that this CPU

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.180
is gonna have no issue.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.040
I'm still confident that this bad boy

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.800
is gonna run circles around that thing.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.080
Now, unlike the Mac Pro with its soldered CPU,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.800
our chip needs a motherboard with a socket to go in,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.000
specifically the Gigabyte TRX50 Aero D.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.160
There's only a handful of TRX50 motherboards

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.080
out there right now,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.480
and we settled on this one

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.800
primarily due to the spacing of its PCI Express slots,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.600
which is gonna make a bit more sense later.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.800
It also, conveniently,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.180
is the least expensive TRX50 board

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.760
while still including great features

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.640
like dual high-speed LAN ports, Wi-Fi 7,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.120
and a whopping four quad-lane M.2 slots,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.200
three of which are PCIe Gen 5.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.520
Now, hold on a minute, Linus.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.640
This is regular Threadripper.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.220
How is this machine pro?

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.640
That is a fair point.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.840
Compared to Threadripper Pro,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.900
we've got fewer PCIe lanes,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.160
so you can't connect as much stuff to it,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.120
and limited RAM capacity

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.800
across half as many memory channels.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.960
But then I ask you this,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.200
how do we stack up to the competition?

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.440
Compared even to this non-pro system,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.400
the Mac Pro has fewer PCIe lanes still,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.380
supports less RAM,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.180
has limited support for professional applications

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.560
outside of video and photo,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.340
and doesn't support ECC memory at all.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.180
It does have faster memory,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.220
but we'll have to see how much of an advantage

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.540
that's going to give it.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.080
Let's talk about memory.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.040
The base model Mac Pro comes with 64 gigabytes

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.800
of unified memory,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.720
and unified memory is legitimately super cool.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.560
Apple RAM is directly on the SoC package,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.440
which increases bandwidth to both the CPU

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.400
and the onboard GPU.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.340
Not only is it fast,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.680
but if the CPU completes a task

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.720
and needs to hand it off to the GPU,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.980
that GPU has immediate access to it,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.600
rather than having to wait for it to be transferred

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.240
between system memory and traditional GPU memory.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.880
Apple's RAM also supports dynamic caching,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.480
meaning that the CPU and GPU can partition

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.480
the system memory dynamically

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.540
to best complete their respective work.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.040
Or at least the M3 can.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.940
It sucks that this Mac Pro is still stuck with the M2.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.600
And what also sucks even more is the price.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.420
We added another 128 gigs to our config,

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.280
which cost us 1600 US dollars.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.840
On the PC side, okay, sure, it's not unified,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.760
but boy, do we ever get a whole lot more for our money.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.760
I am talking double the capacity at 384 gigabytes.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.160
These are Micron's 96 gig,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.760
5600 megatransfer per second DIMMs.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.160
They're registered ECC,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.600
meaning they should be beautifully stable.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.560
And we're gonna fill all four slots here,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.040
maxing out our motherboard.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.800
It's kind of funny we ended up with exactly double the RAM

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.800
because there was that clip that circulated

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.200
of an Apple employee erroneously stating

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.720
during an interview that-

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.880
Eight gigabytes on an M3 MacBook Pro

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.680
is probably analogous to 16 gigabytes on other systems.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.640
I guess that's why it costs twice as much.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.000
Another sore spot that Apple users have been complaining

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.580
about more and more lately is storage pricing.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.880
To go from the stock one terabyte in that machine

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.400
to eight terabytes will add $2,200 to your bill.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.920
$2,200.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.280
For that price, you could buy a whole other computer.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.920
You could buy one of every screwdriver on lttstore.com.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.160
Twice.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.520
Or you could do what we did and pick up two of these.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.920
The Cybert Rocket 4 Plus eight terabyte.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.320
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.640
Twice as much storage.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.720
Hey, Apple, is your eight terabytes equivalent

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.600
to our 16 terabytes?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.960
Is that a thing?

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.840
We're gonna find out.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.800
Yeah, we sure will.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.160
Now, our board doesn't support M.2 RAID,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.880
so we weren't able to use these drives

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.360
for redundancy or extra speed,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.680
but what we can do is just have double the capacity,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.600
whether it's for projects, videos, games,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.940
or whatever we want.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.920
One advantage for Apple, though, has been,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.800
and maybe always will be, sex appeal.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.760
I mean, look at this fine ass cheese grater.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.880
That's why people keep buying this thing.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.800
For us, we've gone with, well, it's fine.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.000
This is the Define 7 XL.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.520
It's not a new case by any means,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.600
but it's compatible with high-end hardware,

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.920
fits lots of storage drives,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.640
and hopefully won't be too constricted

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.960
when it comes to air flow.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.480
Worst case scenario, we'll drill some holes in the front,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.440
bring back that cheese grater aesthetic.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.480
For cooling, we've gone with an NZXT Kraken 360,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.320
because, well, we had mounting hardware,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.240
and with this triple radiator,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.020
it was able to handle our 32 CPU cores under full load,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.200
at least at their default speeds.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.560
The system does support overclocking,

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.160
but it's really not something that we would recommend

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.760
for a pro machine in a production environment, anyway.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.980
Now, while you watch this delightful little montage

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.000
of our cooler being installed,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.600
I'd like you to think back to when I said

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.520
this motherboard has the PCIe slot spacing we needed.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.800
That is because for our build,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.720
we're using not one, but two

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.940
of MSI's RTX 4090 Supreme cards.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.880
Yes, my friends, Apple is what it took

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.520
for NVIDIA's pricing to finally seem so reasonable

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.000
that you can just put in two.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.160
However, there's a twist.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.680
The keen eye among you might've noticed

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.800
that one of my cards is air-cooled,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.320
and one of them has water cooling.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.680
That, my friends, is because we couldn't find

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.560
any combination of motherboard and case

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.400
that could fit two air-cooled 4090s.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.480
And then, well, when we wanted two

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.280
of the liquid-cooled ones, we found out,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.640
gosh, darn it, AI rushed in China.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.960
There's now a 4090 shortage.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.300
So we asked our trustworthy bro, Ryan,

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.900
from the LTT Store support team

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.800
if we could borrow his air-cooled variant,

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.360
and we used our one remaining liquid-cooled variant.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.480
That way, we've got two of the same cards,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.680
but with slightly different hats.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.080
Now, since the shortage, prices for these

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.200
have gone up a fair bit, but I still think

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.280
we're gonna end up looking pretty good by comparison.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.500
Let me deal with that.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.320
Anyhoo, to power this mess,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.920
we went with the Silverstone Hela 2050R Platinum,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.560
or SST-HA2050R-PM for short.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.880
It costs a whopping $670,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.120
which only sounds like a bad deal

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.880
until you compare it to the Mac Pro.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.720
Ah.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.280
Reasonable.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.880
Now that the build's done, all we gotta do

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.640
is fire it up and run some benchmarks.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.160
Now, our final price, not that far off,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.280
but for fun, we're gonna include results

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.400
with both GPUs as well as with only one GPU

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.620
because a little bird told me,

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.720
bird named Elijah, that it'll still win

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.800
even with just one GPU.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800
Yes.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.800
Good job, bird.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.180
Spoiler alert.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.020
I stuttered.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.860
I'm sorry.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.680
I fucked up the shot.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.560
No, I loved it.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.600
It was great.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.320
I had her to please cut around and make me look good.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.880
Can you please freeze frame?

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.680
Cut around him.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.640
Put me on a beach.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.480
You know?

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.140
Like make me look good.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.080
Give him like a Tom Selleck mustache

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.560
and like, you don't know who Tom Selleck is?

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.480
He's the Seleckian one.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.640
What does that mean?

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.760
Couldn't help noticing Elijah.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.760
We're off to a pretty bad start here.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.960
Our system didn't even boot up.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.320
Error code zero D.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.440
You think you've seen little PP energy?

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.720
That's zero PP energy.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.240
And they're booted.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.260
Ah, finally.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.480
PCs.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.320
Yay.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.480
But which one's faster?

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.080
Classroom.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.900
And go.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.740
Wait.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.580
That's, what?

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.400
Is it F12?

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.240
I don't know.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.080
I don't know.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:31.900
Is there a hotkey to render?

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.740
Yeah.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.080
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.900
It is F12.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.740
There you go.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.560
Go.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.400
I got a head start.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.240
F12 on a Mac.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.060
What is this?

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.560
Command option F12.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.400
Oh, I don't know.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.240
I was just guessing.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.060
I give up.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:43.900
If anyone should have had the head start,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.880
it should have been you.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.200
Spoiler.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.320
Are you done?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320
No, I.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.760
Oh, no, it's still going.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.580
Yes.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.780
I am going much faster than you though.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.620
Oh, wow.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.180
Yes, you are.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.580
All right, I finished.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.620
I'm not even halfway.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.440
You started late.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.280
You started late.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.180
Let's give it the benefit of the doubt.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.180
We'll let it heat up, catch up, you know.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.140
I started like five seconds after you.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.380
So quiet though.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.100
It sounds like it's barely doing anything.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.700
Wait.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.100
Since we're still waiting for the Mac anyway,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.140
why don't you run a GPU intensive test

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.020
and see if they spin up?

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:15.860
Yeah, sure.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.680
We'll run Cinebench.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.400
We'll see what it can, what results it can give us.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.240
Oh, you finished.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.060
Did I finish?

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:20.900
Yeah.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.740
Total time.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.820
Oh, 246 was the end result.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.020
Yvonne's so proud of me.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.620
Here we go.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.460
Boom.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.280
It's starting.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.380
Oh, hey, you've got to run it on the Mac too.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.300
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.260
GPU start.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.580
Hey, my fans are spinning.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.140
It's definitely louder.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:38.980
Is it?

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.800
Yeah.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.780
No, I mean louder than the Mac.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.680
Like this thing is silent.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.520
Yeah.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.980
I mean, that's what happens when you hook a Raspberry Pi

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.280
up to a heatsink this big.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.060
It's not a Raspberry Pi.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.300
It's a powerful computer.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.260
It's an Apple Pi.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.620
Yeah, don't feel bad.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.540
Your computer's really powerful.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.380
Good boy.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.700
Okay, this is rendered this multiple times.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.520
We're getting about 65,000 points, give or take.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.940
It's doing it over and over and over.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:05.780
Preparing?

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.100
It hasn't even started.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.220
Let's just run it like four times.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.940
Remember the first gen when Apple was all,

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.180
our GPU was like, mm, yeah, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.060
And Nvidia's like, what are you even talking about?

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.780
Okay, that was the 3090, if I recall correctly,

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.860
not the 4090, but still.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.860
It has done this multiple times

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.540
while it's trying to finish this one.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.440
It's kind of insane how it's just crushing it.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.980
There it goes, it finally finished one.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.520
9,500 points.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.900
We are over six times that.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.700
What was our difference in price?

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.180
Give or take like a couple hundred bucks

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.820
depending on sales of parts.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.160
But final cut, the ecosystem.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.780
I get my Windows phone back.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.620
Please bring it back.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.500
Dozens of people are so upset right now.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.100
Is the noise difference enough

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.060
that you would prefer to buy the Mac over this?

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.060
No, this is still a really quiet machine.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.540
We should put the side panel on in fairness though.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.460
Oh yeah.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.500
Apple's side panel game on fleek.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.740
Kids don't say that anymore.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.080
How would you know?

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.040
You're old now.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.260
Let's do the CPU version of Cinebench first

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.820
before we completely write this thing off though.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.020
And they're off, coming out of the gate strong.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.100
We've got nobody.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.580
Nobody is coming out of the gate strong.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.660
Whoa, hold on a second.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.740
This is actually closer?

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.180
Yeah.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.900
This may be a competition.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.740
Oh, okay.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.940
Oh, PC Pro 2 is picking up speed.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.180
It's coming out ahead around the first turn.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.180
So I'm going to stop that now.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.020
Yeah, please do.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.840
Yeah.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.620
This one had like a moment where I thought, hey.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.460
Yeah.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.280
Hey.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.120
Yeah.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.960
No.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.540
Hey, yeah.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.380
What?

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.820
Cause you said, hey, yeah, it's a song.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.820
Oh, I don't get it.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.660
Do we have scores yet?

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.980
Yes.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.860
3,000, 2,000.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.660
Oh, this one's not even done still though.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.100
Oh, does it give preliminary scores?

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.340
Yeah, I think it's estimating what it's going to be.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.260
Oh, okay, well.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.360
It's almost done it's,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.220
or it's like halfway done it's second one though.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.820
And this one's not done it's first.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.700
It took a bit to spool up.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.820
Yeah, here we go.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.100
Final scores.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.820
3,000 and change.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.420
1,900 and change.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.340
Wow.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.180
Wow.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.940
That's like 50% faster on CPU.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.860
Apple Silicon has been a huge win for them in mobile.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.300
Mac mini.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.120
Yeah.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.980
Super cool machine.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.100
The studio as well.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.940
Cause we're not, we're just dissing this one

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.780
because it's the same spec, but it's like what?

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.140
$3,400 we said.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.420
You're basically, you're paying $3,500 US

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.540
for a fancy case and some PCIe slots.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.580
You don't even have expandable RAM in it anymore

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.660
like you used to.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.200
And that's the problem.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.640
We like Silicon because of its efficiency.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.460
And you know.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.300
We love Silicon.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.160
Can't say that.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.000
Apple Silicon.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.440
Oh, we love Apple.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.760
Silicone.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.600
What?

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.120
Nobody is talking about that.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.080
They're different.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.640
What?

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.780
Silicon.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.620
Yeah.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.640
Is an element.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.480
Okay.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.760
Silicone is a compound that contains Silicon.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.760
So they're the same.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.040
No, that's like saying that water is the same as oxygen

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.720
because there's oxygen in it.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.240
I understand now.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.680
We got there, ladies and gentlemen.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.660
For LOLs gaming?

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.360
Sure.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.180
Let's play a game.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.020
So CS2.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.240
Counter-Strike 2 it is.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.440
Oh, it's going really fast.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.760
Yeah, it's pretty fast.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.800
How fast could you download the game?

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.560
Delete it and reinstall it.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.400
All right.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.220
Manage.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.060
Uninstall.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.880
Here we go.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.120
1.5.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.320
1.6.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.760
Is the Mac gonna win the game download benchmark?

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.520
Oh, did we beat it?

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.340
Three.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.180
Yes, we passed it.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.440
Okay, we beat it for 3.1.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.280
One thing I will say that is a W though,

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.920
that boots way faster.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.760
Yeah.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.840
That was a problem we had with the last Mac Pro Killer

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.080
as well, was that one took a while to boot.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.240
Workstation platforms on PC tend to be

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.720
poorly optimized.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.620
But hey, you can download games at 3.4 gigabit per second

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.840
compared to 2.8.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.320
Wait, is Counter-Strike 2 not available for Mac?

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.140
Did you check?

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.200
It's not available for Mac.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.880
So it's trying to get you to launch it.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.720
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.560
I didn't even realize that.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.020
Okay, Rocket League.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.320
Rocket League's not launching either.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.400
Are you sure this is?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.360
It doesn't work on the M Silicon.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.960
Okay, were you just trying to make a point

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.800
that nothing works?

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.920
Or were we supposed to compare these?

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.360
I was trying to make a point that it's very difficult.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.720
There's very select games that, you know,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.280
you may or may not get to play the ones you want.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.200
Were you?

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.600
Or did you think they worked?

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.720
I totally was doing it on purpose.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.600
It is one of my favorite.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.480
Whoa.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.000
Sound Boomer enabled.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.640
Okay, very cute.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.360
Sound Boomer is not a real thing.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.560
What speaker is that?

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.240
Is it just playing off the boom speaker?

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.600
That sounds like it, eh?

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.560
Is that a thing?

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.560
I didn't know that was a thing it could do.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.980
Well, where's your PC Pro built-in speaker at?

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.440
Hey, fine.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.520
I guess you got me on that one.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.900
All right, I don't have a speaker embedded in my computer.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.360
To be clear, Linux is a piece of...

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.280
Windows is a piece of...

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.680
So when I say macOS is also sometimes problematic,

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.680
don't get upset.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.040
You know, why can't I type right now?

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.380
You know, I'm clicking this box.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.840
I'm highlighting this text.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.320
It's not that my keyboard's not working.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.240
Oh, look, spotlight.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.080
Oh, good.

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.600
Wait, I think I figured it out.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.160
Keystroke receiving.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.760
Dusk would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.440
So like clicking?

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.280
I don't.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.560
Is that what it's asking?

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.840
So it wants access to the keyboard to play?

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.120
I'm exhausted just trying to open one stupid game.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.160
Oh, wow.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.680
This mouse is really laggy.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.280
Imagine the bottom charging port

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.000
not being the worst thing about it.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.320
Hey, wave two.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.480
Shotgun, let's go.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.900
I mean, it looks kind of smooth.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.400
I can't tell what you're feeling with the mouse though.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.400
Does it feel rubbery?

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.240
Oh, no.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.320
Well, the mouse is terrible,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.320
but the actual game is fine.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.160
Okay.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.160
Yeah, it's running super smooth.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.000
Yeah, so why don't I have an FPS counter?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.840
Dumb question.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.960
Did it actually enable?

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.800
I don't know.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.620
Okay, I'll tell you what.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.800
Elijah's gonna find at least one game

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.040
that runs on both of them.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.360
We're gonna have a little graph right here,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.080
but spoiler alert, it's not gonna be pretty

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.880
because the raw horsepower of the GPUs

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.200
in the PC Pro 2 is vastly greater.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.960
And remember that in games,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.600
we aren't even able to make use of both of them

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.240
because NVIDIA no longer supports NVLink

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.720
or SLI at all for that matter on consumer cards.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.560
Jerks.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.440
Okay, Linus, we hear you.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.120
Apple is expensive and none of their products are good.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.960
But that's not what I'm saying.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.040
There are some arguments,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.840
strong arguments for many of Apple's products.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.200
There's the power and portability of the MacBook,

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.080
the efficiency of the Mac Studio,

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.320
or my personal favorite, the Mac Mini.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.900
That thing is a powerhouse.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.680
Or the convenience of AirPods,

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.080
which I happen to daily drive.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.640
It's just that the Mac Pro is so bad

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.800
that Apple will almost certainly can it,

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.560
by which I don't mean turn it into a can again.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.400
I remember that.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.600
I mean, discontinue it.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.400
I mean, even Apple's most ardent defenders

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.880
are starting to realize that Apple's pricing,

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.560
especially with halo products like this,

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.760
just doesn't make any sense anymore.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.320
If you search for the M2 Ultra Mac Pro,

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.720
almost every article or video reaches the same conclusion.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.480
It's dumb.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.820
There are some things that it does do well.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.520
I mean, like the Mac Studio

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.320
because it's the exact same machine.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.720
The single core performance was actually on par

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.440
or even better than our PC Pro 2 sometimes.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.320
And its efficiency is outstanding.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.720
I think its overall power consumption

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.420
is closer to one of these GPUs

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.520
than it is to this entire system.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.400
But for the price of this thing,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.560
you can get a fully kitted out Mac Studio

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.240
for your home office

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.360
and still have enough money to buy a refurbished

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.800
M2 Max MacBook Pro from Apple's certified refurbished store.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.900
Or if all that seems like a bad idea,

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.700
you could buy this fancy Segway.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.840
Now with $700 reels to our sponsor.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.040
Ground News.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.160
They want to change how we engage with news

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.400
by helping us better understand media bias

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.560
and break free from it.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.400
Because while the internet has connected us more than ever,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.840
it's particularly good at connecting us to people

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.880
and news stories that we happen to already agree with.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.080
Ground News solves this by analyzing thousands of articles

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.820
and news sources each day,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.600
merging the coverage of same events

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.920
to help paint a fuller picture of today's news.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.480
Every story on Ground News comes with this little bar

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.320
that breaks down the political leanings

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.480
of the outlets that are reporting on the story.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.840
For example, there was recently a cyber attack

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.480
on a Pennsylvania state court agency.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.120
Outlets from one side of the spectrum

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.480
reported on this story,

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.560
but it received way less coverage on the other side.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.720
Wondering why?

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.160
Well, Ground News lets you look into each outlet

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.920
and dig into what topics they cover

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.160
and what topics they don't and why.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.120
It's time we had a smarter way to read the news.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.560
So go to ground.news.linus or click the link down below

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.200

their unlimited access vantage plan today.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.400
If you guys enjoyed this video,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.240
go back and watch the first time we did this.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.040
That one cost over $30,000

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.600
and it actually wasn't even a clear winner.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.080
So, I don't know.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.440
Hey, at least Apple's cut the price since then.
