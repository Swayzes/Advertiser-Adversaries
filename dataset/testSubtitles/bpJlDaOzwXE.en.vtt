00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.971
Ah, my first day off in however long it's been.

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:08.274
Nothing to do but just relax.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.651
All right, all right, I'm up.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.587
And if I'm gonna be doing tech stuff anyway,

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.255
I might as well hang out with my peeps

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:26.226
from, you know, Floatplane, YouTube, BilliBilli.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:26.559
Me.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.894
And you were here.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.830
Cable management time.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.898
And more.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:33.767
Now that this TV is unexpectedly

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.368
no longer a business expense,

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.070
I was thinking maybe we should mount it

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.473
to the center of the wall and not with drywall anchors.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.276
So we're gonna pull it off and throw it back on

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:45.979
with a sheet of plywood, which will be great.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.815
I mean, it was probably seismically safe.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.651
Just like this segway to our sponsor.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:56.723
Seasonic, their Focus Plus 750 watt power supply

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:59.092
is fully modular and features both

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:03.530
an 80 plus gold efficiency rating and a 10 year warranty.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.231
Learn more and pick one up for yourself

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.500
at the link in the video description.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.402
Realistically, you guys wanna get out of here

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.470
probably pretty soon.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.839
So let's get this off, reposition,

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.240
and get you guys out of here.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.775
Are we doing this thing?

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.077
Yeah.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:19.979
Please don't hurt yourself again.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.514
Can you not?

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.416
Where are we going with it though?

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:24.451
That's a good question.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.152
I think that's probably our best bet.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.654
I think my side's stuck.

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:30.557
Oh, hey-o.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:31.858
Oh boy.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:32.659
How are we doing?

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.660
How are we doing, buddies?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.494
We're fine, don't worry.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:35.728
Okay, it's coming down.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.730
Man, that was much easier this time.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.598
I wasn't here.

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.301
That's all that holds this thing up?

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.403
And the screw doesn't get tight enough

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:44.637
to keep it from rotating.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.072
What?

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.574
Look at these toggle bolts.

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:48.808
It's not even wiggling.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:51.311
You were worried that it wasn't gonna hold up.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:54.981
I was more concerned about seismically stable

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.083
than whether it was actually gonna stay.

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:59.252
Did Elijah work on this?

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.487
What the heck?

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.855
No, I didn't.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.356
This is terrible.

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.859
Like, we've got a glory hole here and everything.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.495
It doesn't go anywhere.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:09.696
There's no glory.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:10.530
Oh yeah.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.331
Oh my God.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:12.198
I'm helping.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:13.733
Elijah, could we have one of those blankets, please?

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:14.567
Yes, sir.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.337
You were asking for it.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.339
Yeah, this seems fine.

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.807
Seems fine.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.810
Did you wanna patch and paint this before we do anything?

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.644
What do you mean?

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:26.112
This is patched.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:26.946
Oh yeah.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:27.780
Oh, it's so lovely.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.082
Look how patched it is.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.151
This is the first thing we need to deal with.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.887
We've got our scary 240 volt

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:36.289
to standard North American adapter cable here,

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.458
but unfortunately, with the bulky ends,

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.261
it doesn't fit through a conduit to the TV,

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.962
which is why it's running through a hall.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:44.831
I just need to remove, LTT,

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.400
the end of this cable store

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.769
with the twist and lock connector, .com,

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.571
with my trusty screwdriver.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:54.073
Go ahead and remove that sponsor block.

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:57.510
Then I gotta transplant it onto this

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.579
after we've run it through the walls.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.281
Elijah, you ready to climb through the walls?

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:02.115
Always am.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.082
I love the enthusiasm,

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:05.652
but that's really not how you pull cable through a wall.

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:06.486
What?

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:07.320
Climbing through the wall?

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.154
Yeah.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:08.988
Well, how do you do it then?

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:09.889
I know.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.057
We're working with him.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:12.992
If there's one thing I know about myself,

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:15.562
it's that I never know what I'm gonna do.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:18.932
So I ran conduit between here in the mechanical room,

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.768
between here and a potential TV location up there,

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:24.604
between here and potential projector location up there,

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:26.873
and between here and that closet over there.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.242
So we're gonna take this 240 volt power,

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.677
which I unexpectedly needed

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:32.111
because I bought a Chinese TV,

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.047
and we're not gonna put it there.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.248
We're gonna put it here.

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:36.916
Boop-a-da-ba-ba-ba-ba!

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:38.051
You wanna help feed this to me?

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.953
The idea is that we're gonna carry this

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:42.589
all the way back to the mechanical room.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.157
Now we gotta lube it up.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:44.991
Why?

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:46.159
There's some 90s.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.794
There's like three 90s here,

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.562
so it can be a little bit challenging,

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.564
especially because there's already some stuff in there.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:53.166
I was kind of joking,

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.734
but I've never actually pulled cable through conduit.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.003
As long as you have a pull wire, it's super simple.

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:59.205
If you don't, then it can be a little bit more complicated

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:00.240
kind of fishing a thing through,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.041
but basically all we need to do

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:05.044
is take the end of this and a new pull wire

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:07.413
so that we will always have a pull wire there,

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:10.750
and tape them to the existing pull cord,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.153
which, not gonna lie, a little confused right now.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.856
I'm gonna go check the other end.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.491
Okay.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.927
Nope, moves freely from this end.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.195
Weird.

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:23.329
New plan, Elijah.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:24.163
Okay.

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:26.199
We're gonna take a cable that was already in there

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.135
that has an extra 30 feet on it, long story,

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:31.271
and we're gonna use that to pull the other wires.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.138
Okay.

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:32.972
Then we pull it back.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:33.773
Okay.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:34.641
It'll be great.

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:36.009
Do you wanna pull or do you wanna push?

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.076
I will push.

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.878
I feel like there's less responsibility.

00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:40.280
Actually pushing is way harder

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.481
because you gotta manage all of this

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:42.782
without it getting tangled up.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:43.683
Then I will pull.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:44.517
Cool.

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:45.351
Okay.

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.720
Time for Luby McLuberson to do his work.

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:52.025
Elijah, were you, you know, gonna pull it?

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:57.030
I think, I think it's this cable coming out right here.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.065
Elijah?

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:01.701
I don't know if I'm supposed to be pulling yet.

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:02.535
Oh, I'm stuck.

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:04.937
He's calling me.

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:05.772
Hey, buddy.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:08.908
Hi, were you gonna pull on the cables at all or?

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.443
I am pulling.

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:13.479
Okay, yeah, you gotta pull with your arm strength.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.448
It's like 20 feet above me, bro.

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:16.449
You got this.

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:19.719
Oh, wait, hold on.

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:20.553
I gotta lube it.

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:21.354
I gotta lube it.

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:22.221
Just a sec.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:27.360
Elijah, just, can you relax and just pull the cable?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.662
I'm trying to pull the cable.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:30.496
Okay, okay, hold on.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:32.031
Let me pull it back a bit then.

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:33.733
Just pull evenly and slowly

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:36.703
like how you're pulling a cable.

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:39.305
Okay, not in a jerking motion.

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:41.741
I'm not doing it in a jerking motion.

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:42.575
Can I try?

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:43.976
Sure, please do.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.011
Please do try.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:51.150
Yeah, like I'm stuck at the same spot for a while.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.554
She's going.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.322
Hey, we made it.

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:57.957
You know what I think the problem was?

00:05:57.957 --> 00:06:00.193
As soon as most of the inside was lubed,

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.561
it was smooth sailing.

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.062
It's just that these Corning cables

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:04.897
have a bit of a rubbery sheath on them

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.499
compared to a pull wire,

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.868
which is slicker and designed for this.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:11.938
So I think it was getting quite jammed up in there.

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:13.473
All right, nice.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:14.841
Okay, that's it, guys.

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.143
Please tell me it's gonna make it to the rack.

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:21.314
Yeah, Elijah, don't worry.

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:22.148
You wait for me.

00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:22.982
I'll get this tape off.

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:23.816
Well, it's your house.

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:25.251
Yeah, by the way,

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.487
a big one for me when I'm pulling cables,

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:30.456
resist the temptation to put two different pieces

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:31.457
of tape on it.

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:33.993
Resist, because when you're unwrapping it,

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.228
you will be very unhappy.

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:38.898
Were you guys sure this was gonna reach to the rack?

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.100
Oh, I didn't realize we need to go all the way down there.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.105
Oh yeah, she sits, she sits, but barely.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.640
We're just gonna move the rack.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:49.475
There, Jake was giving me a hard time

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:50.810
about not putting down the feet,

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.844
keeping it on wheels.

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:54.180
Ha, who's the idiot now, Jake?

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.081
Checkmate.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.816
Boom, right there.

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:57.817
Awesome.

00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:00.620
Should've measured that before we put it in the wall.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.622
Okay, our plan is we're gonna do the outers

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:06.192
with normal screws and then the inners with the lags.

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:07.693
I mean, we can probably just use normal screws

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:08.528
for everything, right?

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:10.129
It’d be fine. It's your wall.

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:11.297
Yeah.

00:07:11.297 --> 00:07:12.231
I mean, realistically,

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.499
it's gonna be better than what we had,

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.601
which was drywall anchors.

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.103
Good ones, togglers.

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:18.805
Just fine.

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:19.872
But drywall anchors.

00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:25.411
If you want, stands right there

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:28.114
if you wanted to have a mark that's like right here.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.215
It's not my house, so.

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:34.921
He laughs, but then that's actually what he's doing.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:35.955
Okay, Elijah.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.461
Oh, he really is me.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.362
Yeah, you really Elijah'd that one up.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.032
Elijah's not a verb.

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:47.934
It is now.

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:54.207
Whoa, jeez.

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.242
I'm done.

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:01.781
These are the doodads to keep it from whacking the wall

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:03.249
and we didn't put those on before

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.351
because we were told it was just temporary.

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:08.221
I wasn't entirely sure what they were for

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:10.122
and the manual was in Chinese.

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:10.957
Yeah, that's also true.

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:12.158
And I don't read that.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:12.992
Really?

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.093
Yeah, unfortunately.

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:15.461
You look like you would read Chinese.

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.196
I can read a Chinese menu.

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:27.807
Were we going to run that HDMI cable as well?

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:29.242
Balls, yes.

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:30.409
Where's the pulling stuff?

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.678
Ah, theoretically, again,

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:35.281
the cable that I had running along the floor is long enough,

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:37.483
but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:39.218
Elijah's first cable pull.

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:40.953
It's so sweet.

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:41.821
Okay, what am I doing?

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.257
Am I just like pouring it on like sauce?

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.992
Sure, okay.

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:47.927
You show us how you would lube something.

00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:49.595
Well, I have no experience.

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:52.164
You gotta move your diamond play button.

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:54.300
What a one percent issue to have.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.902
The lube's not coming.

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.436
I'm trying to get the lube out.

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.407
Stop laughing.

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:03.442
I've never done this before, bro.

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:07.246
Just get lube on it and then I'll pull it.

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.282
You gotta keep putting lube on while you feed it.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.383
Really, the whole time?

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.217
Yeah, the whole time.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.051
Why?

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:14.253
So that it continuously has lube on it.

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:15.087
Yeah.

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:16.022
Do you need me to pull back or?

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:16.289
Nope.

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:16.556
Oh.

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:17.757
Yeah, I got it off.

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:18.624
Oh, okay, cool.

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:19.292
You got it?

00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:20.326
I felt it.

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:21.327
Oh yeah, it's there.

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:21.627
You got it?

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:24.997
Okay, do you, is it there though?

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:26.799
I feel it, but it keeps disappearing.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.334
I don't know where it's going.

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:29.168
Sorry.

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:31.037
Maybe it's going back up into the conduit?

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:31.871
Yeah, I think so.

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:33.472
That can happen sometimes on the toilet.

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:34.674
You just gotta make sure.

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:37.810
Stop.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.644
But I don't think my fingers are long.

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:39.478
Do you have it though?

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:41.080
No, my fingers aren't long enough.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.848
Well, okay, is it there or not?

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:43.683
Yes, it is there.

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:44.917
How about now?

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:46.619
You're a jerk.

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:50.089
I was like, I don't know where it's going.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.290
Okay.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.858
TV back on wall?

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:53.893
TV back on wall?

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:54.727
Ready?

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.162
One, two, three.

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:57.296
Wow.

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:59.432
How can you guys say this is not 400 pounds?

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:02.101
I'm pretty sure the box weight was right.

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:04.337
Oh guys, it's not centered.

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:05.171
I'm kidding.

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:06.272
I'm totally, I'm totally kidding.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.773
100% kidding.

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:08.975
It's perfect.

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:10.376
I was ready to throw hands.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:16.382
Let's get this HDMI boy over here.

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:17.550
You can pull it out more.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.619
Maybe I just need some lube.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.953
Oh, I have it upside down.

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.957
I am gonna have to clean this thing.

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:27.126
Yeah, actually, it's got a ton of fingerprints.

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:28.794
That's gonna be a bit of a chore.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:31.530
It's gonna take a minute, you know.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:34.900
First world problem, I'm sorry.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.436
I need an hour to clean my TV.

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:38.571
With that off the honeydew list,

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:39.972
it's time to take care of something

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:43.209
that I should have done a long time ago.

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:44.910
What is this?

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.812
There's no charging cables for the headphones,

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.614
so they run out of battery half the time.

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:50.583
There's cables all over the place

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:52.818
and the risk of accidentally unplugging

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:55.321
something with your foot, very high.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.856
So we've got iCron on one side.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:58.324
We're gonna have all of the power bricks

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:01.594
for the monitors or the iCron itself all in the center.

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:03.696
And then on this side, we're gonna have our power bar

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:05.498
or whatever side is closest to the outlet

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:06.399
that makes it best.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.300
I can't see through the cables there.

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:11.404
I'm in jail.

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:12.872
Are these metal?

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:14.407
Oh, perfect, they are.

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:16.342
Okay, so just for something simple like this,

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:18.711
I probably won't need that 3M backing.

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:20.680
I can kind of just get it all bunched up,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.582
put it in our little comb here and stick.

00:11:23.582 --> 00:11:24.417
Awesome.

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:25.451
Yeah, I just don't want it dangling

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:27.653
for someone to kick or something like that.

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:28.487
That's pretty good.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:30.022
So Glenn was actually just asking me

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:32.491
what actually these little iCron silver docks are

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:33.592
that I'm plugging everything into.

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:35.094
In case you've missed it in a past video,

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:37.730
Linus explained that it passes all of the USB

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.765
from the computers that are in the server room

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:41.233
to a similar dock like this,

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.003
all just through the fiber cable here,

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:45.071
which is actually pretty sweet.

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:47.540
You can get all of your front IO, your rear IO,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.842
and USB just coming right through this fiber cable,

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:50.676
which is kind of the only thing

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:51.610
that makes it a cool setup.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.678
All the heat is over there.

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:55.614
Everything else is a mess and it's chaotic.

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:57.717
Man, I'm ready for this.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.418
Got my cable ties in different lengths,

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:02.455
got my cable arches in different sizes.

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:05.558
Hmm, why is this wall plate just hanging out?

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.794
Step one is to fix these DisplayPort wall plates

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:13.499
that we set up ages ago with these extensions.

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:16.635
The shorter the run and therefore the less loss we have,

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.571
the better with these fiber optic cables

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:19.839
that are running through the walls.

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:23.642
And then we should decide on one orientation for these.

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:26.679
So let's go cut off up,

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.614
because we're tops when it comes to cutting corners.

00:12:28.614 --> 00:12:29.715
That's how you can remember.

00:12:29.715 --> 00:12:31.317
I rely on little memory tricks like that

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:32.485
when I'm doing a repetitive job.

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:34.954
Otherwise I have absolutely no chance.

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:35.955
Half of them will be one way

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:37.523
and half of them will be the other way.

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:39.058
Boy, if you wanna put that on the wall,

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:40.893
you gotta take the outer plate off first.

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:41.727
What?

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:43.395
Elijah told me to put the outer plate on.

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:44.563
He told you to put the outer plate on.

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:45.998
Well, how are you supposed to screw the inner plate on

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:47.032
if the outer plate is on?

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:48.334
Well, no, it goes through the inner plate.

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:49.168
No, it doesn't.

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.002
What?

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:50.836
No, there's two screws.

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:51.670
There's the long ones.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.671
Those go in the inner plate.

00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:53.806
And then there's the short ones

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.007
that go through the outer plate.

00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:55.975
Are you joking right now?

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:56.809
No, I'm not.

00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:58.177
That's what I did with that one.

00:12:58.177 --> 00:12:59.378
Well, what? How'd you?

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.080
I told you. I was like, oh, it's not centered.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.248
And you were like, oh, it's fine.

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:02.615
What?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.282
What are you?

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:04.817
Don’t, no, don’t investigate now.

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:05.651
I didn't know.

00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:07.286
What have you done over here?

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.021
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:11.290
You know, have you ever heard the expression,

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.591
she doesn't find you handsome,

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:14.727
but she better find you handy or something like that?

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:15.561
Yeah.

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:16.395
Yeah.

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:17.229
Which one are you?

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:19.632
Thanks, buddy.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.033
I have none.

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.701
Oh, I see what you did.

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:23.536
So I did it right?

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:24.370
No.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.171
Oh.

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:26.038
No, no, I see what you did.

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:26.872
I didn't say it's right.

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:30.209
You had three extra screws

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:33.579
and a misaligned thing.

00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:35.047
Well, no, if you get it in

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:36.382
and extra screws are just bonus.

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:38.017
This is for all the zoomers out there.

00:13:38.017 --> 00:13:40.686
There's four holes that matter, okay?

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:43.088
You got your inner ones, right?

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:44.924
Those go into here.

00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:47.293
I'm starting to get it now.

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:49.895
I was so confused.

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:53.732
See, when you said it wasn't aligned properly,

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:56.969
they didn't cut out large enough drywall cutouts

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:57.803
for all of them.

00:13:57.803 --> 00:13:59.738
So I thought that that's what you meant.

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:01.941
Cause I thought these holes were the ones going

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:03.409
into what you're screwing into.

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:07.046
But these are just to go onto the DisplayPort.

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:09.415
Now what I was kind of thinking

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:11.650
for all the random cables under the desk

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.221
was we could just take one of the Mondo extra large ones

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:18.190
and then just like hang everything from it.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.925
And just as long as it's toward the back,

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:20.793
you won't really see it.

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:21.660
Yeah.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.461
That sounds good to me.

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:23.295
Cool.

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:24.196
One of those things with cable management

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:27.032
is it always gets really ugly before it gets good.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.603
So, but once it comes together,

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.304
it comes together really quick.

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:34.573
Well, it's not about the look under the desk.

00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:37.176
It's about the look of under the desk.

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:41.313
Man, this looks so much better from when you don't do that.

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:42.147
Well, that's fine.

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:43.415
Yeah. Which is the goal, right?

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:44.416
Yeah. That's why there's sit-stand.

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:46.385
We can keep lowering it.

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:48.020
Keep going down until it looks good.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.421
I know you got these as well.

00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:50.256
Yeah.

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:51.090
Where did you want these?

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.992
These hold both your headset and controller, right?

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:54.159
Yeah. These are super cool.

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:55.861
I didn't realize when I bought them

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:57.263
from the pictures on the website

00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:58.797
that these are just 3D printed.

00:14:58.797 --> 00:14:59.732
I noticed that.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:00.599
Yeah.

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:02.101
The point is they're cool.

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:03.702
They're 3M mounted.

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:05.504
I don't see, I mean, I'm sure we could put a screw in it

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:06.939
if they end up having a problem,

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:09.642
but I was kind of thinking like, oh, there,

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:10.509
but not there, I guess.

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:11.010
Like there.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.410
Sure.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:11.810
Right?

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:12.478
Then I'll do that.

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:13.245
I'll do this one.

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:13.545
Cool.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.180
We'll see what can be done first.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:15.915
It's a race.

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:17.283
I can't get the,

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.851
I can't get the three-

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:19.718
I got the backing off!

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.553
How close to the front are you?

00:15:21.553 --> 00:15:23.022
Oh, I already, I already put it.

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:23.656
Interesting.

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:26.458
Okay so you're aligned with the front.

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:27.293
Yeah, sure.

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:29.662
Yeah, that was not what I meant, but close enough.

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:30.863
Not gonna lie.

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:32.598
Kind of sick.

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.033
How's the cable go?

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:35.501
The cable?

00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:36.835
Because you said you wanted to plug the cable in,

00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:38.137
but the cable for the controllers is right

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:39.104
in the top middle.

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:41.507
Yeah so I was thinking about that just now.

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:44.476
I have an idea.

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:46.578
You're probably not going to like it.

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:50.049
Oh, that's definitely 3D printed.

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:51.750
Quality.

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:54.119
That's not that bad, right?

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:58.590
And then just have to kind of, you know, or something.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.259
Oh, so you don't ever want them wireless.

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:03.028
Yeah, they'll just be wired all the time.

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:06.799
I think the idea was to have these hubs on top of the desk.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:11.403
So I'm kind of feeling we scooch the desk pads

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:13.439
right aligned, but then with like,

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:16.775
maybe like a one centimeter gap or something like that.

00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:20.245
And then these hubs can sit right there

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:23.015
and we can just a double-sided adhesive them.

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:25.417
I have a variety of options for mounting the hubs.

00:16:25.417 --> 00:16:26.852
This is super cool stuff.

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:28.887
It's like a micro suction surface.

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:29.955
Oh, I've seen you use it before.

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:31.991
Yeah, if the bottom of them is smooth.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:32.992
Yes.

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:34.493
This could actually work really well

00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:35.561
because it's non-permanent,

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:39.932
but I also have a double-sided tape and not a word.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.834
Command strips.

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.737
Oh my God.

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:46.171
You're not supposed to do that.

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:47.973
That's not how you use command strips.

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:48.841
Yes, sir.

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.010
Well, now that Linus is gone,

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.444
he's trusting me to drill the hole.

00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:54.146
Ow, I just stepped on a cable.

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.783
I'm the responsible one.

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:02.821
I think I did somehow a way cleaner job than your dad did.

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:03.655
Mine looks fine.

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:06.692
His looks like someone chewed through it.

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:07.860
Before your dad gets back,

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.061
let's pick up all the garbage.

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:10.029
Cause I think we've gotten to the point

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.864
where like the cables are all organized.

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.532
That's just making more garbage.

00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:17.836
I get what Linus has to deal with now.

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:19.738
It's like dealing with me.

00:17:19.738 --> 00:17:21.540
Hey, nice.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.343
Fantastic.

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:25.344
Works.

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:27.646
There are no cables running across the floor.

00:17:30.482 --> 00:17:32.985
There are no cables running across the floor.

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:34.720
Fantastic.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.922
Elijah's just finishing up Yvonne's machine

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:40.225
and the only one we didn't get to touch today is mine.

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:42.795
But which we did on purpose.

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:44.897
So we could show you guys the contrast

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:47.366
between the before and after so conveniently.

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:51.003
I'll do mine later.

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:54.106
What can't wait till later is telling you about our sponsor.

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:56.642
Dennis spends $1,200 on a graphics card

00:17:56.642 --> 00:17:59.178
only to find out he's actually purchased a potato

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:00.345
from a sketchy site.

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:01.180
He's not dumb.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.414
He just didn't use Jawa.

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.348
What's Jawa?

00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:06.652
Jawa is a marketplace where you can buy and sell PC parts

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:08.987
at reasonable prices from reasonable gamers.

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:10.222
No potatoes allowed.

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:12.458
Listing your PC parts is easy breezy.

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:14.560
Just upload some photos, click a few buttons,

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.595
slap on the shipping label and get paid.

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:19.331
But say you want to sell your GPU like today.

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:20.999
Jawa can give you an instant quote

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:22.701
and buy it from you directly.

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:25.704
Hassle free and quicker than you can say bangers and mash.

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:26.538
And mash.

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:28.907
Plus Jawa also works with a curated group

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:32.111
of verified sellers to offer all kinds of PC parts.

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.479
Some of them will even research

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.414
and build a custom rig for you.

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:38.050
Now Dennis doesn't overpay for potatoes.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:38.917
Be like Dennis.

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:41.120
Go check out Jawa at the link below.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.655
If you guys enjoyed this video,

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:45.090
how about Alex D's upgrade?

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:45.924
Yeah, that was a good one.

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:46.758
Yeah, that was a good one.

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:47.593
Go check it out.
