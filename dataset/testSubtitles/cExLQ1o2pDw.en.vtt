00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.830
- There's over $100,000
inside of this bank vault.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.060
And now that it's sealed

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.130
this key is the only way to get inside.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.963
And whichever one

00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:12.390
of these guys touches the
vault first gets what's inside.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.288
Go!

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:14.121
- Oh boy.

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:19.121
- What do we do?

00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:21.751
- Oh.

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:22.584
- Hey, Chris is through.

00:00:22.584 --> 00:00:24.300
Is anyone else gonna make it?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.460
Oh, and Chris touch the vault!

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.900
- I didn't really even do anything yet.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.920
- Just pull on the handle.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.753
- Oh.

00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:31.684
- You get nothing.

00:00:31.684 --> 00:00:33.570
This was just a decoy vault.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.910
Now the boys are gonna run
through all the challenges

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.890
and hope that the safe
they win is the safe

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.313
with the $100,000 prize for their dad.

00:00:40.313 --> 00:00:43.740
- Oh my God.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.573
Nolan go.

00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:45.406
He's going.

00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:46.239
Nolan, watch out.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.160
There's one over your head right now.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.240
- Oh.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.073
- Did Chandler hit one?

00:00:49.073 --> 00:00:49.906
- No, no

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:50.739
It was so close.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:51.572
- I'm so scared.

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:52.410
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.580
- I'm gonna go for it.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.600
- Nolan's making progress.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.530
He's about to win and there we go.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.363
- Yes!

00:00:57.363 --> 00:00:58.470
- No! No!

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.910
- Why am I so good at this?

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.350
- Because you're so skinny and lanky.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.159
- Did your dad just win a hundred grand?

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.780
Or next stage you have to carry mannequin.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.800
- Are you kidding me?!

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.730
- At least the mannequin's very handsome.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.563
- He is so handsome.

00:01:10.563 --> 00:01:12.510
- Welcome to my favorite room.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.030
The city of red solo cups.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.240
There's over 1 billion
red solo cups in here.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.350
- I just don't think that's true.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.183
- Don't count them.

00:01:20.183 --> 00:01:22.695
What could you possibly find
in here that would open a safe?

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:23.640
- A key!

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.473
- A key!

00:01:24.473 --> 00:01:25.306
- I said it first.

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:26.139
- A key.

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.972
- Begin searching.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.910
This is so satisfying to watch.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.460
I don't even feel like
they're looking for the key.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.963
- Chandler find that key, man.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.320
- Oh! Boo-yah!

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.270
- That's what I'm talking about!

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.210
- Whooo!

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.140
- Let's see what your dad just won.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.930
It's if you win the
hundred thousand dollars

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.060
your dad also gets a Tesla now.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.010
- Whoo, yes!

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.000
- Keep watching.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.110
Let's go to the next one.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.690
I brought the boys to our
next safe and blindfolded them

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.520
so they couldn't see the garage door.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.720
That is now falling.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.610
You gotta make it under, go.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.436
- Oh, do they make it?

00:02:07.436 --> 00:02:08.430
Oh Karl did it.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.510
Karl touched it first.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.010
- Come on, show me a hundred grand.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.870
- It's probably not a hundred grand.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.950
- It's not a hundred grand,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.233
but your dad did win $10,000 in cash.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.263
- Yeah man.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.740
You don't care about your dad?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.940
- I tried, I ran.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.773
- Pathetic.

00:02:21.773 --> 00:02:23.310
- Let's see if the next
vault has a hundred grand.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.840
This is a mountain of Legos.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.760
And that is a key dangling in the air.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.600
- Look at it dangle.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.433
- Whichever one of you

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:30.570
uses those Legos to
build to that key first

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.770
gets what's in the vault.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.760
- You go Karl.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.950
- Start stacking, start stacking them.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.850
- You weren't even close.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.840
- He's a rule breaker.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.010
- Chandler, you have a good vertical.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.610
Can you try to jump and grab it?

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.390
- Oh my ankle. You see that?

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.400
- And while the boys are
trying to grab that key,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.160
I want tell you guys about
Current, the future of banking.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.740
With Current, you can do all
your banking on your phone.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.960
You can literally sign up,
send and receive money.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.243
Cash checks all from
within the Current app.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.723
- Oh.

00:02:56.723 --> 00:02:57.596
- Oh.

00:02:57.596 --> 00:02:58.429
- A piece.

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:59.490
- No, he almost had it.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.320
- This is the same company
that sponsored this video

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.180
and gave everyone that signed up $1

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.283
and 10 people a thousand dollars.

00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:07.650
- Oh, he got it.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.483
- Nice.

00:03:08.483 --> 00:03:09.316
- And I got it.

00:03:09.316 --> 00:03:11.190
- Before you open that, can
you apologize to Current

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.023
for cutting off the ad?

00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:12.960
- I'm very sorry Current.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.430
- What's in the safe?

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.810
- Hundred grand baby.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.010
- It's not a hundred grand.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.126
It is, If you don't win the
next challenge your kicked

00:03:20.126 --> 00:03:22.260
- All this hard work to get nothing.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.700
You pick the worst one to win.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.350
- If you don't win this
next challenge, man

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.340
I'll be so disappointed.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.460
- We're back in the laser
room and turn them on.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.840
- How are we suppose to
make it through this?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.150
- As you see it disappears
and then reappears.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.983
- Okay?

00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:35.220
- You have to cross in between the lasers

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.053
when they disappear.

00:03:36.053 --> 00:03:37.410
I need to finish telling you about Current

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.820
because Chandler interrupted us.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.653
- Sorry.

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:41.760
- The first 100,000
people to download Current

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.290

I will literally deposit $1

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.370
- Wow, that's free money.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.540
- This is my Current tag.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.870
And I'm gonna be sending
$20,000 in cash to random people

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.703

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.540

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.893
- Chandler?!

00:04:03.893 --> 00:04:04.726
- Yeah?

00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:06.030
- If you touch a laser,
you and your dad are out.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.863
- I know.

00:04:06.863 --> 00:04:07.920
- He's gonna attempt
it when it disappears.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.180
Okay. Made it.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.013
That's one.

00:04:10.013 --> 00:04:11.160
Can he do it again?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.143
- This is nerve wracking.

00:04:12.143 --> 00:04:13.380
- Okay.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.570
- Hey, why aren't you guys joining him?

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.403
- We didn't-

00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:17.850
- Oh, what is this,
the Chandler challenge?

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.683
- Kind of.

00:04:18.683 --> 00:04:19.516
- Oh, he's over here.

00:04:20.892 --> 00:04:21.725
- We made it.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.420
- That's it skinny boy.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.650
- This is the last one Chandler.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.990
This has the shortest duration
between when it disappears

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.823
and comes back.

00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:31.350
Oh, wait, wait, wait, I
need to see the slowmo.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.350
He's about to do it.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.800
There is no break in the laser.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.915
He successfully did it. Congrats.

00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:41.220
- Yes! We didn't get kicked.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.220
- Chandler, what's in the vault?

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.580
Oh, it's upside down.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.413
- I hope you're Chandler.

00:04:45.413 --> 00:04:46.246
Wait. How'd you know?

00:04:46.246 --> 00:04:47.640
- I did this before you guys came in here.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.473
- Oh.

00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:49.633
- You won nothing, but at least
you're not kicked Chandler.

00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:51.090
(cheering)

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.910
- This vault is protected by
a plunge of electric wires.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.460
The wires only react to
metal, so it's safe to touch.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.860
But I tried to scare the
guys with this little trick.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.080
Just to show you what would
happen if you did touch it,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.432
I would recommend you don't.

00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:03.360
- No!

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.193
- There's sparks?!

00:05:04.193 --> 00:05:06.690
- I thought it would look
hilarious to watch the boys tiptoe

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.880
around these wires thinking
they were actually electric.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.110
But Chris, for whatever reason

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.610
just had no fear and just
ran straight through it.

00:05:14.757 --> 00:05:16.219
- Oh!

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:17.760
- Oh!

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.600
- Chris touched it.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.830
Anyways, Chris thought he won.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.910
The guys thought he cheated.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.710
So we decided to move on to the next room.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.550
Thank you, Chris.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.930
Welcome to the next room.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.763
- What the heck?

00:05:25.763 --> 00:05:26.970
- Everyone take a stand.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.520
You guys are gonna be voting
for who opens the safe.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.350
Maybe there's a hundred
grand behind that vault.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.183
- So what's the rule,

00:05:32.183 --> 00:05:33.270
we can't vote for ourself or something?

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.380
- You can't vote for yourself.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.213
That is correct.

00:05:35.213 --> 00:05:36.046
- Ooh, I knew it!

00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:37.470
- Right? Who you want to open the safe?

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.730
Who'd you vote for?

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.563
- Karl!

00:05:39.563 --> 00:05:40.396
- Yeah, baby!

00:05:40.396 --> 00:05:42.450
- I voted for Nolan because
I don't want him to win,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.800
and he'll somehow find a way.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.210
- Nebraska Nolan.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.860
- Nolan has two votes.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.810
And Chandler who did you vote for?

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:49.643
- Chris.

00:05:49.643 --> 00:05:51.781
- Chris? Which means
Nolan won with two votes.

00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:52.614
- Yes, a hundred thousand dollars!

00:05:52.614 --> 00:05:54.120
I'm gonna get this.
Dad I think this is it.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.953
I feel it.

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:56.070
It's a hundred grand.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.903
- Okay.

00:05:56.903 --> 00:05:57.900
- Please don't be it, please
don't be inside of it.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.884
- Next room you get to
use a metal detector.

00:05:59.884 --> 00:06:00.870
- What for?

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.790
- Inside this giant beach is a key.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.900
Let the challenge begin.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.127
I think you can see why
you want a metal detector.

00:06:05.127 --> 00:06:06.873
- I can detect the key.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.780
- Stop. I'm trying to find a key!

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.610
- Oh, why are you trying
to use your metal detector?

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.020
Why don't you detect this?

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.982
- Oh, I found it.

00:06:13.982 --> 00:06:14.879
I got it.

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:16.212
No! Move off me.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.040
I got a rock.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.390
- He thought the rock was the key.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.043
- I got sandy for nothing.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.560
- Okay. I'm gonna be honest.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.030
They found the key, but it broke.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.900
- It doesn't count.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.733
- It does count.

00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:29.566
- Yes!

00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:30.720
- Congratulations.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.088
On winning a $5,000 home Depot gift card.

00:06:33.088 --> 00:06:34.020
(cheering)

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.980
- I'll take it.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.690
- That's every dad's dream!

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.120
At the start of this video,
this big vault was empty

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.770
and we covered it with a black sheet.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.360
But now we're gonna fill the same vault

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.850
with the $100,000 cash prize.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.523
We're about to see whose
dad wins a hundred grand.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.360
As you can see, you are
back in the first room.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.890
- You put nails up there?

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.150
- Yeah, I don't want you climbing over it.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.390
Remember whoever touches this
first gets what's inside.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.350
- A hundred grand.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.280
- Oh, I didn't say go.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.113
- He didn't say go.

00:07:00.113 --> 00:07:00.946
- He didn't say go.

00:07:00.946 --> 00:07:01.800
- But I just said, go.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.633
- Go!

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.802
- Don't kill me!

00:07:09.802 --> 00:07:14.760
- There you go Chris, that was a good one.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.701
- That was a lot of glass!

00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:18.101
- How do I get through this?

00:07:20.662 --> 00:07:21.878
- Ah! Ah!

00:07:21.878 --> 00:07:22.890
- What am I doing wrong?

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.240
- Guys just break the glass.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.593
- Hey Nolan, Watch out.

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:28.590
- Oh, Nolan touched it.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.840
Nolan, the vault is unlocked.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.673
Have at it.

00:07:31.673 --> 00:07:32.874
- Hundred grand.

00:07:32.874 --> 00:07:33.707
- Here we go.

00:07:34.578 --> 00:07:37.060
Yes! Hundred grand!

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.080
Look at all this money! Look at all of it!

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.000
Look dad, you get hundred grand!

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.200
- I'm so proud of you Nolan.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.700
You're the best bank robber ever.
