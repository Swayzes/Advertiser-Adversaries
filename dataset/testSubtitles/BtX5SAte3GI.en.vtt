00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.070
12 years ago, I promised Luke that if he stuck with me,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.740
he would never go hungry again!

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.742
Or without a gaming PC, anyway.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:12.278
The problem is that his tastes have gotten kind of expensive.

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.513
And I think it's time to convince him

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.516
to let me out of this one-sided agreement

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.585
with the help of our sponsor, Lexar,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:22.922
who is helping me make the process as painful as possible.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.457
I'm never leaving this agreement.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:25.658
Okay, that's not your line.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.496
As painful as possible.

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.698
What, like I have to build it myself or something?

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:35.101
No, you have to watch them build it.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:35.935
Oh!

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.140
Are you ready to be the very best like no one ever was?

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.974
I mean, yeah.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.275
I'm actually kind of excited for this.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:43.276
That's a cool idea.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:48.548
Bye, Luke.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.582
Don't worry, we got this under control.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.152
Oh, like I'm not helping advise or anything?

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:53.787
You'll see in a bit how we did.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.355
Wow.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.023
Okay, bye.

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.092
Luke's computers are always Pokemon themed,

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:03.063
but instead of a rock type like his previous Geodude build,

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.132
we are going full grass type

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:07.834
with one of the original starters

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:11.104
from Pokemon Red and Blue, Bulbasaur.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:12.872
Plastic baggies full of green stuff.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.742
You're sure we weren't going Afro-man themed?

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.610
It is weird that there's condensation in those bags.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.545
Afro-mander.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.481
I'm thinking it might be easier

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.782
to get some of this stuff in place

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.217
before we build the system.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.186
Who wants to be on decoration duty?

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.153
Me please.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:27.987
Not it.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.158
I see you guys managed to find the most hazardous glue.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:35.261
Got CA and this giant hot glue gun.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.663
What could go wrong?

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:37.831
Everything.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:41.201
We're gonna decorate it to look like a Bulbasaur habitat?

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.402
Yeah, exactly.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.736
Oh wow, there's grass.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.573
Is this computer gonna suck like his old one?

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.942
No, it'll suck in a completely different way.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:49.776
Oh.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.311
You picked the parts for my old one.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.145
I don't know.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.880
I don't do any of that weird stuff.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.081
That's on you, man.

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:55.915
Okay, all right.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:57.417
Sort your supplies.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.251
Trees.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.953
Yeah, so make a tree pile.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.554
Isn't craft time fun?

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.388
I think so.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.223
Yeah.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.191
That was a matter of time.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.759
And then here's a bunch of flowers.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.594
What about this?

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.028
What about this?

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:09.863
What about it?

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.932
Here's what we're gonna start with, my little ladies.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.434
These tubes right here,

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.903
they're pretty white and pretty boring right now.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:17.737
It would be cool.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:19.439
Let's put this on it.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.306
Maybe not.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.842
Why don't we put these vines on it?

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:23.676
You look busy.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:24.511
Why don't you help me build the computer?

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.712
See, I looked away for how long?

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.480
Look how long I looked away for.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.915
Someone needs to actually build the computer.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:29.749
Up you get.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:30.583
He's just gone.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:31.417
Help me better.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.786
The girls are actually doing their jobs

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.455
and the boy isn't.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:36.322
Yeah.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.257
That's true.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.992
That's actually true right now, at least.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:39.826
All right.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.161
We aren't gonna be covering the CPU and greenery,

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.562
so why don't we start here?

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.831
We've got the Ryzen 7 7800X 3D.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.732
This is a great chip.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.401
Eight core, 16 threads that boost up to 5 GHz.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.304
And AMD's 3DV cache that helps it outclass

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:54.574
much more expensive chips in the right scenarios,

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.042
specifically gaming.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:03:00.180
However, most 7800X 3Ds are great.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.016
We tested over a dozen of these for a recent video

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.786
and Luke will be getting the absolute worst of the best.

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:08.021
That's still pretty good.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.824
Yeah, you don't need to do that to make it the worst.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.826
The very worst bin we could find.

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:14.661
But a really good CPU?

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.062
But a really good CPU.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:16.896
It's fine with me.

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.231
Do you remember how to install a CPU?

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.766
Do you think you can figure it out?

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:20.266
I did it.

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:21.100
Wow.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.001
Wow.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:22.569
Thanks.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.403
Come on, boy.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:24.237
Come on, little man.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:25.738
I'm not the one building the computer today,

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.440
so you're gonna have to actually figure it out.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.274
Okay.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:29.542
Nope, nope.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.077
How's your confidence now?

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.279
It's basically Lego.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.113
He'll figure it out.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.815
Lift this up.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:36.683
Nope, not that.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:37.650
You already lifted that.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.618
Nope, not that.

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:39.452
This.

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.054
Woo!

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.021
Don't bend those pins,

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:43.189
because then the board is dead.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.490
And this is a really nice board.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.994
We've gone with an ASRock X670-E Taichi.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:52.599
It's a little wide, E-ATX, but that's fine.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.867
Just means you need to be careful when you pick your case.

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:57.437
It's also got this nifty white marble pattern

00:03:57.437 --> 00:04:00.340
that, A, partially matches the case

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.308
that kicked off this round of upgrades.

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.243
Yes, my friends.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.612
Luke thinking this case is cool is the whole reason

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.413
that he was like, yeah, I should get an upgrade right now.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.781
I was like, okay, that makes perfect sense.

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:09.616
Yeah.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:10.583
Yeah, what's up with that?

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.385
I didn't ask for an upgrade at all.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.754
How did this happen?

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.789
I mentioned that the case was cool to Jake

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.258
like a year and a half ago.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.626
It's on Jake then.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:20.827
And he was like, oh, you should do like

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:21.828
a build upgrade into it.

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.830
And I was like, oh, we'd just be like migrating parts.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.731
Like, I don't know.

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.032
Maybe I'll just do it on my own time.

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:28.101
And also will be even funnier

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.270
when we cover it up with a whole bunch of greenery.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.104
So you can't even see it.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.438
This thing just broke.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.273
Yeah, no, no, that's fine.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.340
That's supposed to break off.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.575
We've all been through that part.

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:37.210
It feels wrong when you do it.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.077
Who put this?

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.279
Did you put this in here?

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.113
Me, yeah.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:40.913
Oh, okay, you got it.

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:41.781
Oh, that's all.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:42.582
Oh, wow, okay, good job.

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:43.416
Okay.

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:45.418
The cameraman had to help me.

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:46.252
Oh.

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:47.120
No, no, no.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.423
Dad, it got tangled.

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.257
Hi, oh, okay.

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:52.458
So hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.227
That's very tangled.

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:55.828
Why did we think this was a good idea?

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:58.798
Ah, where are the ends?

00:04:58.798 --> 00:04:59.666
I don't know.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.100
I found one.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.336
My love, do you know what a rhetorical question is?

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.170
No.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.673
It means it's a question that you don't actually expect

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:07.507
to be answered.

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:08.908
I found one though.

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:09.742
Okay.

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:13.179
And yours is wrapped and looks so.

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:15.415
How did I get such sassy kids?

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:19.719
I think that's not a difficult question to answer,

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:20.953
but also rhetorical.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:28.294
I think that you are ready to start working on this.

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:30.430
There are some things that you can't cover up.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.067
Youngest child working on most critical components.

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:35.034
Let's go.

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:38.705
We've got to be able to plug in anywhere there's a plug.

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:39.739
I think everything else is fair game.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:40.573
Good advice.

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:41.441
All right, yeah, yeah.

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.775
Oh, wow.

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.778
The beautifullest AIO.

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:46.612
Most beautiful.

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:47.480
The beautifullest hair.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.314
Okay.

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:49.982
It's most beautiful, not beautifullest.

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:50.817
I know.

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:51.651
They got more sass than an old server.

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:53.453
That is also something you would do though.

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.987
Wow.

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:56.222
Good job.

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:58.691
We chose this board, not only because it looks good,

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.860
but also because it's got PCIe Gen 5,

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.295
active cooling for the VRMs,

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.731
though apparently we'll be covering those with grass,

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.734
four DDR5 DIMM slots for our 64 gigs

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.403
of 6,000 megatransfer per second Thor memory

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.338
from our sponsor for this build,

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:13.706
Lexar.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:16.109
These guys went all out on the looks of these modules.

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.344
Norse print on a tasteful aluminum heatsink

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:20.179
designed for superior heat dissipation.

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:22.515
It supports XMP and AMD Expo overclocking

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.217
and comes with a limited lifetime warranty

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.320
that probably won't cover child-related damage.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.955
So Luke, you better pray my kids don't break it

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:29.789
when they install it.

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:30.623
Do I push this?

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:32.792
I mean, yeah, but the angle matters.

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.660
So don't just like shove it.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.829
Normally it would matter which slots you're installing in.

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:39.799
We're using all four, which should be fine.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.501
You can run into some compatibility issues

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:42.668
with four sticks of memory,

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:44.871
but this is single rank memory, so.

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:45.705
This is scary.

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:46.939
I don't wanna break it.

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.708
I mean, I don't care.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:49.909
I care a little bit, actually.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.144
Lexar sponsored the video,

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:52.812
so be careful not to break their stuff.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:53.746
Wow.

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:54.881
Hedgehenge.

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.751
Okay, why don't we get this glued on?

00:06:58.751 --> 00:06:59.852
This hurts me.

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.220
Goodbye, infinity mirror.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.054
Oh, man.

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:03.156
Hello, infinity glue.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.357
Why does it hurt you?

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:05.792
Never coming off.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.794
But look how beautiful it is now.

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:08.895
How you doing, kiddo?

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:09.762
One more.

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:10.596
Are they all clicking into place?

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:11.431
Yeah.

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:13.199
Nice.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.033
Not bad.

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:14.867
All right.

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:16.002
Maybe the tech tips are hereditary.

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.737
Do you think you can handle the glue gun?

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:18.571
Yeah.

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:20.273
So we just wanna use a thin layer

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.508
over the whole area that we're gluing, okay?

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:24.410
You have a little bit of time before it sets.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.378
There you go.

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.946
We're trying to make it straight.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.548
Is that the right orientation?

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.683
No, it's not on straight.

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:32.151
That was so perfect.

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:33.419
It's not on straight.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.253
Okay, that's fine.

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:35.655
I mean, it's just Luke's computer.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:37.690
The next thing we're gonna be hooking Luke up with

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.959
is two of Lexar's award-winning

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.162
four terabyte NM790 PCIe Gen 4 drives.

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:46.065
Lexar claims read speeds of up to 7,400 megabytes a second

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:48.468
and writes of 6,500 megabytes a second,

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.802
which is well within the requirement

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:52.572
for you PS5 console gamers out there.

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:55.241
You can even choose to have a heat sink or no heat sink,

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:57.577
meaning it can fit into all kinds of tight spaces,

00:07:57.577 --> 00:07:59.412
like the tight spaces we're creating for ourselves

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:00.980
by putting plants all over this.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.316
Why are you giving him eight terabytes of storage?

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.251
Because Luke's a gamer.

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:06.118
So?

00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:07.753
So he needs a lot of games, I guess.

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.456
Mine only has like one terabyte, and I'm a gamer.

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:12.758
Well, Luke was born first.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:13.593
So?

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:15.461
So, first born privilege.

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:16.662
He's old.

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:17.497
Yeah.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.331
Got him.

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.235
Oh, man.

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.836
I think we're gonna try and put them under here

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:25.371
because I think we can put two here.

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.239
Under?

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:28.107
Yeah, so you gotta take these screws out first.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:29.709
And then every time you use this,

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.611
you have to say lttstore.com.

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:32.778
Lttstore.com.

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:34.347
Nice, good job.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.348
Lttstore.com.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.182
Okay, we'll know like every time you-

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.149
Lttstore.com.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.784
Okay, not constantly.

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:39.619
Okay, my girls?

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:40.453
Every ratchet.

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:41.521
I have something for you guys to decorate.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.455
Who wants the long one?

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:43.422
Who wants the wide one?

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.257
Long, please.

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:45.224
I want the wide one, please.

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:46.559
Okay, that worked out great.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.095
As for you, you're gonna have to take this heat sink off

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:51.330
because there's a heat sink already on our motherboard.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.066
Precision screwdriver coming soon to-

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.268
Lttstore.com.

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:56.102
There you go, good job.

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.638
This screw is so small.

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.973
It would be a shame if it fell on the floor.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.810
How's your confidence doing?

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.812
Still decently high, to be honest.

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:08.514
He's quite competent, in general.

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:09.682
Nope, nope, not that.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.984
A little bit lower.

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:12.818
Oh, no.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.255
Spoke a little soon there.

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.323
I'm picking these slots

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:19.091
because they're both under one heat sink,

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:21.193
which means Luke will have to do less removal

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:22.562
of grass-covered heat sinks

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.497
whenever it's time to access his SSDs.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:25.598
So considerate.

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:26.432
Yeah.

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:27.266
Okay, watch your fingers.

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:28.100
I'm just gonna glue this down.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.035
Yeah, that's never coming off.

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:31.037
We got hot glue right on the screws by accident.

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:31.971
By accident?

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:33.673
That's okay.

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:34.874
Can you help her, though?

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.375
Yeah, would you like help?

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:37.310
No, thanks.

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:39.512
I tried, Luke.

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:41.147
I really did try.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.715
Fine, I have a new task for you then.

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:45.251
Lian Li are super bros,

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:47.920
and they put their fans on the cooler ahead of time.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.456
Normally, I would actually change the orientation

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:52.625
because I prefer to have the fans

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:54.093
pulling through the radiator fins

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:55.895
so that it's a little bit easier to clean.

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:57.496
Luke doesn't have any hairy pets

00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:58.531
or anything like that, though.

00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.932
They're all feathery friends.

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:02.635
So we're just gonna leave this

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:04.837
and screw this into the case.

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:05.671
That's it.

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:09.108
Does this produce a lot of dandruff?

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:09.942
Cool.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.510
The place you're gonna be installing this

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.878
is at the back there.

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:14.146
Is this okay to take off?

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:15.214
I would leave that for now.

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:16.315
Yeah, I'd leave that for now.

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:17.149
You're still pulling it.

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:18.818
Okay.

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:20.419
Wow.

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:23.623
You wanna show the camera?

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.025
That bottom right thing is...

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:27.360
This is, yeah.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.028
You know, the GPU's gonna cover a lot of that.

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:30.863
I mean, I've heard this is kind of in style, though,

00:10:30.863 --> 00:10:32.031
the little triangle patch.

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:34.300
These fans need to spin,

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.601
so we can't put on anything

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.103
that gets in the way of them spinning.

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:38.537
But what we can do

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:40.506
is we can decorate the hubs in the middle.

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:41.674
They're infinity mirrors, but...

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:43.909
Now they're infinity Bulbasaur.

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:46.879
You wanna put shrubs on there?

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:48.114
You wanna put bushes on a fan?

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:49.682
You can't do that.

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:51.984
Trees might not be the best idea

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.853
because I don't think they'll stay on very well.

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.254
Shrubs.

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.255
I like the shrubs.

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:57.123
Thanks, David.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.391
Really helpful.

00:10:58.391 --> 00:10:59.592
Stickers.

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.827
I think stickers are a really good idea.

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.763
This seems like a perfect opportunity

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:05.031
to talk about our case.

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.065
We're building this whole mess

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.933
in the Lian Li O11 Vision,

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:09.602
and the best thing about it

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:11.837
is how much tempered glass it has

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.572
to show off my kids' incredible handiwork.

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:14.740
Okay, the real reason we chose it

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.377
was that Jake really wanted us to include this part

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:20.413
that he machined in high school

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:21.580
for a water cooling setup

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.749
that Luke never got around to building,

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:25.918
and this case fits it.

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:28.754
Do you have any idea what he's talking about?

00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:30.222
Yeah, but then you guys didn't use it.

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:31.691
This, the stand.

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.427
Because this went like that,

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.629
so there was a plate that was machined

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.497
for the bottom of the reservoir

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.599
so that it could stand on this little post.

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:42.535
David says it was supposed to be the stand

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.903
for jacked Bulbasaur.

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:44.737
Ah, okay.

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:45.571
We didn't use it.

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:46.439
No.

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:47.373
The Vision variant of the O11

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.375
is especially good for custom water-cooled rigs,

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.177
but something that complex

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:52.578
was a little bit tough for my kids,

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:55.514
so we're just gonna put that Lian Li AIO in

00:11:55.514 --> 00:11:56.916
and call it a day.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:59.452
Hopefully the daisy-chain compatible radiator fans

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:00.720
will simplify the install.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.754
I don't remember the last time

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:03.556
I was this stressed out doing a PC build.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.225
That's because you barely ever do PC builds.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:08.094
The back is so sharp.

00:12:08.094 --> 00:12:09.962
Hashtag Lie-nus

00:12:09.962 --> 00:12:11.230
Use the knurling.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.064
Use the what?

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:15.668
Have you shown him how to use a screwdriver?

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:16.736
Yes.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.437
Which way, righty-tighty?

00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:20.039
I don't know, right can be either way.

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:22.274
Right or right.

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:23.676
He gets really good grades.

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:26.512
Wow, this is something.

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:27.880
This is too.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.782
Yeah, okay.

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:31.751
How about...

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.252
This is also technically a thing.

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:35.755
What if you guys overlap the fan

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:39.158
and then we just kind of cut along the outside

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:41.293
and then we just kind of wrap it like that

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:42.828
and then we can kind of sticker bomb it.

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:43.662
I don't think I've ever heard you

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:45.431
be such a fan of stickers before.

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:46.799
Just looked really good.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:47.633
Yeah.

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:48.467
Wait, is that the kind of screw that was in there?

00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:49.702
I think it was a thumb screw.

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:50.870
What's a thumb screw?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.905
This kind, the kind that you can do with your thumb.

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:54.774
Dad, I don't think it was a thumb screw.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.275
Oh, okay, then put in whatever kind.

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.210
Realistically, it doesn't matter what kind of screw it is.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.578
It's Luke's computer, so who cares?

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:02.114
I don't want to wait half an hour for Luke to do an update.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:03.115
I don't want to wait half an hour

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:05.117
for you to get this power supply installed.

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:08.154
We game together sometimes.

00:13:08.154 --> 00:13:11.223
And one time, me updating my games took quite a while.

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:13.292
But this won't change that at all

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.360
because that was internet speed.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.494
What's a power supply?

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:17.029
I'll give you two hints.

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:19.131
Power and supply.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:20.266
So it makes power.

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:22.535
Well, no, it supplies power.

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:24.336
But that's basically making power.

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.971
No, it doesn't make power, it supplies it.

00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:28.374
And if that's unexpected, supplies.

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:30.142
Okay.

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:32.411
That didn't really land.

00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:33.279
No.

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:38.250
Wow, you guys did a spectacular job here.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.153
I think we're ready to install this in the case.

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.188
Do you want me to show you guys how to do it

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:43.823
or do you want me to give you something else to decorate?

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.825
Something else to decorate, please.

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.694
I'll be right back.

00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:49.795
Didn't even look at the computer.

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:51.664
Oh, a little bit, for a second there.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.866
No, they're really not that interested in the computer.

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:57.503
Can I show you guys where this is gonna go?

00:13:57.536 --> 00:13:58.370
Oh my.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.907
Brown kind of worked with what we were doing.

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:02.741
Yeah.

00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:05.144
And then maybe you can tell me if you have some cool ideas

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:06.412
for what we could put on it.

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:07.279
No, thanks.

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:08.113
Yeah.

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:09.782
No, you don't want to decorate it?

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:10.616
Actually, yeah.

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:13.586
The GPU is gonna go right there.

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:16.255
So with that in mind, do you guys have any bright ideas

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:18.357
for what you want to put on the back

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:20.292
or on this side of it or on this side of it?

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:21.827
Maybe like vines.

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:23.262
Ooh, we could put some vines on.

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:24.230
Yeah, vines.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.731
Yeah, and then maybe on the back,

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.900
we could put grass and we could make a field

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.635
and that could be where our Bulbasaur lives.

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:30.469
Sure.

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:31.303
Yeah.

00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:32.137
Okay.

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:32.972
All right.

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:33.806
So supportive.

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:34.640
Yeah, vines.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.474
Yeah.

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:36.308
Definitely flowers.

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:37.643
You guys can put flowers on this one

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:39.411
once all the grass is on it, okay?

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:40.279
Boo.

00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:45.217
We should only need two pieces

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:47.186
if you guys use them efficiently.

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:49.421
And there are some places you can't cover.

00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:52.658
We can't cover here because that's gonna impact cooling

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:55.494
and everywhere else is probably fine realistically.

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:57.630
Also note, I said, don't cover this,

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.733
immediately the one place they want to put something.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.735
Time to get this radiator installed.

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:03.836
I'm not supposed to be doing this.

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.070
So you're doing it.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.572
And it goes in this spot here.

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:08.941
Yeah, probably not.

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:09.775
He gets really good grades.

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:11.744
Really good grades.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:12.578
Oh, look at that.

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.546
You made a little cutout for the power connector.

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:15.381
Good job.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.182
Dad, this has dots on it.

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:18.017
Oh, that's fine.

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:20.019
We can just cut a new bit for that.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:21.320
Okay, how's it going?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.655
I did it.

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:23.856
Good job, Reddit.

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:27.293
So he got the rad and the fans by himself?

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:28.694
No.

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:30.562
So thermal compound goes on the CPU.

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:31.931
Is this safe?

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:32.798
Yeah, it's safe.

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:36.235
Okay, so put it up against it.

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:37.403
Yeah, you're gonna have to squeeze

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:40.940
like you didn't inherit your mother's strength.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.144
She has fortitude, but not strength.

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:45.978
Yeah.

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:47.713
Okay, let's get this glued down first.

00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:48.547
Sound good?

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:49.381
Good.

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:51.650
Okay, this is happening.

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:54.420
I'm excited about the trees.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.622
Truthfully, this is a bit of a side grade for Luke.

00:15:56.622 --> 00:16:00.059
It's an Asus 4080 Noctua OC Edition.

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:04.330
It's got 16 gigs of GDDR6X, little overclock on it.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:08.600
Most importantly, it has these sick gigantic Noctua fans

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.536
that are dead freaking silent

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:14.073
while keeping this thing running nice and cool.

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:16.842
And they're gonna have some insulation to work against now

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:18.844
in the form of this grass.

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:20.079
It smells bad.

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:21.280
Yeah, it's hot glue, honey.

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:23.882
It's a great card and it'll run anything you throw at it.

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.485
But realistically, the biggest reason we chose it

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:28.954
was Noctua's trademark brown aesthetic.

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:31.590
It goes perfectly with our forest theme.

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:34.560
Or it'll look awful in a white case.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.996
I don't know, it all remains to be seen.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.464
Yeah, I think it looked great.

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:40.399
Oh, it stinks.

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.001
This is actual moss.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:43.502
What?

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:44.336
How does this work?

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:45.137
Fluff the moss.

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:45.971
It's moss.

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:46.805
Is that okay though?

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:47.639
Like, is it gonna rot?

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.741
Well, we fluffed it.

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:49.641
Is it gonna rot?

00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:51.010
Now it's fluffed.

00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:54.813
What happens to dried out moss over time?

00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:56.849
Sounds like a Luke problem.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.117
It's also a lot of glue.

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:00.252
Yeah, well, it was all flaky.

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:02.321
I didn't want it to come off.

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:04.123
There, moss.

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.924
Oh wow, good job, you guys.

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:08.394
Is Luke gonna have to water his computer?

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:09.261
I mean, it depends.

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:11.397
If you wanna keep your moss green, you might.

00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:12.231
That's true.

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:13.298
You tested all this stuff ahead of time, right?

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:14.299
Oh yeah, it all works.

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:15.834
Okay, or at least it did.

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:16.702
It did.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.271
It's been great, he plugged in all the power.

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:20.139
Nice.

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:20.939
That one goes there.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:22.841
It only goes in one way, so just try it one way,

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:24.143
and then if it doesn't go, then try it the other way,

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:25.110
and then if it doesn't go again,

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.512
then you must've screwed it up the first time

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:28.547
and tried the other way again.

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:29.615
USB, baby.

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:31.650
What if it doesn't go the third time?

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.185
Well, then try again.

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:34.019
Wow.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.922
Baldasaur will really like it.

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:38.891
Yeah, I think so.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.193
You guys are gonna decorate the GPU support,

00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:42.361
and then when that's done,

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:44.797
it's gonna be time to make a field

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:46.932
and some trees and stuff for Baldasaur.

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:48.834
Should we make this a pond?

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:51.103
No.

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:55.641
GPU support, ah, nice.

00:17:55.641 --> 00:17:57.376
Gonna put on RGB cables.

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:58.343
Watch me fail.

00:17:58.343 --> 00:17:59.778
Nah, dude, you got this, you got this.

00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:01.346
Oopsie.

00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:02.781
Okay, so we have two of them.

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:05.117
Dad, at the end, can I make one of these things

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:06.552
where you put it over your head, please?

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:07.853
You can do it now if you want.

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:09.188
Yay!

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:11.623
But how am I gonna put it together?

00:18:11.623 --> 00:18:12.791
I have no idea.

00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:14.193
I can hot glue it to your head if you want.

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:15.027
Yeah, please.

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:17.162
Wait, not to my head.

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:18.097
Yeah, please.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:18.997
Wait.

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:23.402
We are getting really close to putting it together

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:25.237
and decorating time.

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:26.638
Got a rear fan here.

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:31.677
David, what are you, what?

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:32.778
It's our tree stand.

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:33.612
Look at this.

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:34.480
A tree stand.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.014
It's our third fan in the bottom.

00:18:36.014 --> 00:18:38.183
And you can stick trees in it.

00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:39.418
I don't know whose ideas are worse,

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:41.220
the kids or the adults.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.421
That's a good idea.

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:46.859
Editor's Note, make a code that says Luke's PC

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:49.628
to get 5% off stuff in the LTT store.

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:52.197
You're not allowed to give discounts on LTT store.

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:56.235
Editor's Note, make a discount on the LTT store.

00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:57.069
He figured out the code.

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:59.037
If you clap, they can't say no.

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:00.873
So this is gonna go here.

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:02.374
You guys need to think then.

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:04.276
Anywhere where there's gonna be stuff in the way,

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:06.145
you can't have tall trees.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.379
But we can have flowers.

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:08.747
Yeah, you can have flowers here

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:10.382
or little bushes and stuff.

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:12.718
So I was thinking maybe Bulbasaur could live in here

00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:14.987
and we could have some trees kind of out here

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.923
and he could have like a little hidden away area.

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:18.757
Okay.

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:20.058
We've already seen this Bulbasaur,

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:22.427
but have you seen this Bulbasaur?

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:24.296
Can we vote?

00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:25.430
I vote for big man.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.000
Little Bulbasaur is gonna live up here somewhere.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.868
And then big fat Bulbasaur can go in the front.

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:31.336
He's not fat, he's big boned.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:33.071
So guys, can you make a forest

00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:35.874
and a little habitat for Bulbasaur on the back of the GPU?

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:37.743
So this is gonna be the front corner.

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:40.345
So maybe have it face this way.

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:42.281
Amazing contribution, little man.

00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:43.582
Oh man.

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:45.384
We now need to put some hot glue.

00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:47.719
Oh, I feel like there's gonna be some extras for this one.

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:50.556
LMG.GG slash floatplane.

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:51.890
Let me put it this way.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.360
Jacked Bulbasaur is never moving.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.330
So you want flowers on the tree?

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:00.666
You don't have to do all of them,

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:02.801
at least one of each color though.

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:05.437
That's the face of a man who's regretting his decisions.

00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:07.906
Yeah, he's starting to run out of energy.

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:08.874
How's the front part look?

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.375
Wow, it looks like he's,

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:12.945
it looks like he's like crashing through the trees.

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:15.814
That was unintentional, but it's so sick.

00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:16.682
He's like,

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:19.384
Here's the big moment.

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:20.219
You guys ready?

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:22.054
This isn't the big moment, Bulbasaur is the big moment.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.422
Oh, this is a pretty big moment.

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:24.990
Wow.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.426
Tree sticking out of this wall, please.

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:30.762
I like that this now implies that you are jacked Bulbasaur.

00:20:30.762 --> 00:20:32.898
Please turn on computer, please.

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:35.133
This would be so much work to redo at this point.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:36.735
I guess before we press the power button,

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.837
I should talk about our Seasonic 1000 watt

00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:40.372
Prime TX power supply.

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:42.674
Luke ran into a few power supply related issues

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:44.176
during the Radeon challenge.

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:46.511
So we wanted to pick one that he could trust.

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:48.914
It's got a hybrid fan that only kicks in at 40% load

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:53.185
for that Zen state that Bulbasaur so much enjoys.

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:54.753
And it's 80 plus titanium certified.

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:55.854
Against my better judgment,

00:20:55.854 --> 00:20:59.558
we have used Lian Li's streamer RGB cable extensions.

00:20:59.558 --> 00:21:02.594
I am not a fan, but neither is Luke.

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.097
Wow.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.201
It's beautiful.

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:11.403
Is that beautiful or what?

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:13.071
The sticker bomb with the RGB behind it

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:15.674
actually looks kind of amazing on the fans.

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:18.410
Like unironically, looks really cool.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.279
Hey, David.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.113
Oh, yes.

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:24.283
There it is.

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:26.652
Who can be trusted to do the sticker perfectly?

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:27.519
Me.

00:21:28.353 --> 00:21:30.122
Bulbasaur sticking his tongue out.

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.591
Ow.

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.559
I just broke it, by the way.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.094
That really hurt.

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:37.429
I was trying to play it cool.

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:38.263
Did you bleed?

00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:39.097
It hurt, oh yeah.

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:40.232
Is your blood in my computer?

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:41.066
Oh yeah.

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:42.634
And definitely tears.

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:43.468
Wait, hold on.

00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:44.703
If I started spinning again.

00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:48.040
If I break this one and this one.

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:52.744
Normally there is logic to that, but I've had-

00:21:52.744 --> 00:21:54.179
Yeah, it's a seven blade fan.

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:55.013
Yeah.

00:21:55.013 --> 00:21:56.415
Yeah.

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:57.582
Sorry about that, bro.

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:58.583
Oh, I don't think there's any way

00:21:58.583 --> 00:22:00.252
to balance a seven blade fan.

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:01.119
Not really.

00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:01.953
With fewer than seven blades.

00:22:01.953 --> 00:22:02.788
Nope.

00:22:02.788 --> 00:22:03.622
Well, I tried.

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:04.456
We'll put a new fan in there.

00:22:04.456 --> 00:22:06.091
David in the background, nope.

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:09.795
But it looks perfect.

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:12.064
And what about this shape I cut in the middle

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:13.198
on the flower?

00:22:13.198 --> 00:22:14.266
I know, we'll put it back on.

00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:15.133
Don't worry.

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:16.935
We can take that off and we can put it on the new fan.

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:18.970
Here we go.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.572
Look at that.

00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:22.441
Wow.

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:23.575
It looks great, though.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.078
It does look great.

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:26.912
And I helped.

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:29.348
Bad news, everyone.

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:32.184
I think Luke is going to absolutely love it.

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.018
Uh-oh.

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.720
What we're trying to figure out right now

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.622
is A, whether he and I are actually related,

00:22:37.622 --> 00:22:39.825
because if we are, he should be pretty good at Halo.

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:41.626
And two, whether this computer

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:43.862
can actually handle a gaming load.

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:45.664
We did put some stuff in there

00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:48.233
that shouldn't obstruct the airflow.

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:52.537
CPUs at 52, GPUs at 35 degrees.

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:54.873
Yeah, see, the Noctua fans just don't care at all.

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:55.707
Nope.

00:22:55.707 --> 00:22:56.775
That's wicked.

00:22:56.775 --> 00:22:57.976
Are these temps right?

00:22:57.976 --> 00:22:59.511
That's incredible.

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:00.979
That can't be right.

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:01.813
That's actually crazy.

00:23:01.813 --> 00:23:02.881
I think it can be right,

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:04.683
because it was, like, it was...

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:06.418
Do you have Halo frame capped?

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:07.719
That's quite the growth.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:08.553
Yeah.

00:23:08.553 --> 00:23:10.756
The Bulbasaurs are having some protein.

00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:11.757
They are.

00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:12.591
You know what?

00:23:12.591 --> 00:23:15.594
Under a heavier load, it would probably get hotter,

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:16.828
because you're probably right.

00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:18.697
Halo is probably frame capped.

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:19.531
Still.

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:20.432
Still pretty good.

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:22.868
Lexar asked us to do a quick Crystal Disk Mark run

00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:23.935
to validate their claims

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:25.537
about the performance of this drive.

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:26.371
And there it is.

00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:29.241
Everything's performing exactly like we would expect

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:31.810
in spite of the situation in there.

00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:34.579
Do you want me to look away?

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:35.947
It's a labor of love.

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:37.549
Children worked on it.

00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:38.550
Don't be too harsh.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:39.384
Okay.

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:41.453
What?

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:42.320
No, this is amazing.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.155
What do you mean?

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:43.989
Oh my God.

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:44.823
And he immediately puts this back to the camera.

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:45.657
Thank you, Luke.

00:23:45.657 --> 00:23:46.691
You've forgotten everything.

00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:48.560
That is so awesome.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.829
I love how it's, like, swole Venusaur too.

00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:52.431
He's not just, like, chilling at all.

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.900
It's Bulbasaur, not Venusaur.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.035
Man, this is actually so cool.

00:23:57.035 --> 00:24:00.038
And it's mostly not broken.

00:24:00.038 --> 00:24:01.907
And we think it might work.

00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:06.278
I suspect this, like, you know,

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:09.915
stuff coming out of the bottom is probably gonna continue.

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:12.150
Well, given that we used real moss.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.853
I was gonna say, it looks really realistic.

00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:16.054
Where did you get it from?

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:18.490
So this moss here and this moss here is real?

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:22.093
I mean, real in the sense that they're organic.

00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:22.961
Oh my.

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:23.795
It came from outside.

00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:25.330
It came from outside.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.833
We need to put the bottom panel in.

00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:29.234
What is it?

00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:30.068
Bulbasaur.

00:24:30.068 --> 00:24:30.902
No, like, what's in it?

00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:32.237
What are the components?

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:33.705
Is that just part of the mystery?

00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:34.539
I guess.

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:35.373
I don't get to know.

00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:36.475
I guess you'll find out what's in it

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:37.309
and why we chose it.

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:38.143
It's grass.

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:38.977
See, it's grass.

00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:41.213
It's GTX grass.

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:43.882
Yeah, also that fan might be missing some blades.

00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:45.383
What?

00:24:45.383 --> 00:24:47.853
Well, the kids, I mean, can't be trusted.

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:48.720
You did.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.721
You did.

00:24:49.721 --> 00:24:50.956
I'm not surprised that Linus

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:53.058
may have been the biggest problem with this build.

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:55.160
LOL fan deal with it?

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.061
Is that you?

00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:56.895
No.

00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:59.397
I approve of this message, though.

00:24:59.397 --> 00:25:02.234
This may be one of my favorite builds

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:03.635
we've ever done, actually.

00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:04.469
No joke.

00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:06.771
We just filmed a video on our favorite builds.

00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:08.740
This would have been in it 100% for me.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.574
Yeah.

00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:10.442
This is super cool.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.314
The little details, like nothing lining up at all,

00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:18.917
they kind of get lost in the overall package.

00:25:18.917 --> 00:25:21.019
Yeah, like, I honestly didn't notice at all

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:22.120
the first time I looked at it.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.054
And like now.

00:25:23.054 --> 00:25:24.189
Now that you've watched it,

00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:26.291
you can probably spot some.

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:27.592
But it doesn't seem that major

00:25:27.592 --> 00:25:28.960
because there's so much going on.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.464
Yeah, and look, this fan totally still blows some air.

00:25:32.464 --> 00:25:36.902
Technically, not very much, but technically, yeah.

00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:40.472
It looks sweet.

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:42.674
I'm super, super stoked.

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:44.476
And I'm super stoked to tell you guys,

00:25:44.476 --> 00:25:45.810
hey, why not go check out the video

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.780
where we spilled a can of Coke into a computer

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.550
and then, spoiler, fully recovered it.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.384
Oh.

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:53.218
No damage.

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:55.387
So there's hope that I'll be able to survive with the moss.

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:57.389
I said Coke, not moss.

00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:58.223
Still green.

00:25:58.223 --> 00:25:59.057
Yeah.

00:25:59.057 --> 00:25:59.891
For now.

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:00.992
I think it'll be okay, I think.

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:03.061
That fan's buzzing a little.

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.429
Sounds like a Luke problem.
