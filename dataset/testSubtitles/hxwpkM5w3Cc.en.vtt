00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.650
- I tied up an FBI agent.
(words pop)

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.840
If he steals this hundred
thousand dollars from me

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.520
before midnight, he keeps it.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.353
This is a knife.

00:00:06.353 --> 00:00:07.500
Good luck. Let's go, Tareq.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.640
- [The Boys] Oh, oh, what do we do?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.473
- [Tareq] Oh my gosh, we gotta go.

00:00:09.473 --> 00:00:10.980
- [Jimmy] Tareq, our first
stop's through the woods.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.480
- [Tareq] Jimmy, why are we
doing this again already?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.000
- Relax for one second.
I've been tied up before.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.800
- [Chris] He's getting
so much time ahead of us.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.420
- [Jimmy] We're coming out
the other side of the woods.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.590
Our getaway car is over here.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.580
- [Tareq] Whoa, that's a nice car, Jim.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.660
- [Jimmy] The car matches my bag.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.103
- [Tareq] We gotta go. We gotta go.

00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:25.080
- [Chris] How are you gonna catch him

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.520
if your hands are tied?

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.990
- And now we drive down this path.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.510
You guys have no idea what I
have in store for the boys.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.930
I rented an NFL football
stadium, an island, a maze,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.490
and tons of other cool things.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.323
And stop!

00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:37.530
- [Tareq] Oh! Why are we stopping already?

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.363
- Just watch.

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:39.720
You see this giant telephone pole?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.553
- [Tareq] Uh huh.

00:00:40.553 --> 00:00:42.063
- Watch this.

00:00:42.063 --> 00:00:43.929
- [Tareq] Oh, oh, oh my gosh-

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.120
- Let's get back in the car.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.620
(car revving)

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.010
- Buckle up.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.972
- Now there's a giant telephone
pole blocking the exit.

00:00:52.972 --> 00:00:53.805
- [The Boys] Oh.

00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:54.638
- Oh, here we go.

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:55.650
- [The Boys] Hurry.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.909
- Grab on. Push it over.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.590
- Ohh!
- Push go.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.550
- [Karl] Guys, hurry up!

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.290
- We put a GPS in my underwear

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.170
so the FBI agent and the boys
will always know where I'm at.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.280
- [Nolan] Jimmy turned.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.150
- [Chris] Oh, wait, he turned?

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.990
- [Nolan] He turned left.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.220
- If you zoom in-

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.053
- It's a maze!

00:01:09.053 --> 00:01:09.886
- It's a maze!

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:11.730
It gives us the layout of the maze.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.563
- We're now at the Hedge Maze

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:14.010
and I got the hundred thousand dollars.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.810
Look at how huge this maze is.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.030
We gotta be careful because
it'd be easy to get lost

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.211
and for them to catch us in here.

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:20.087
- [Jimmy] Uh, I think it's this way.

00:01:20.087 --> 00:01:21.870
- [Tareq] Okay...Uh, how do you know?

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.250
- I've done this maze like 10 times,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.250
but the boys have never been here.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.891
- We're just gonna push him and push him,

00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:27.420
get him out of the area,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.190
and then as he's tiring,
we'll handle this.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.270
- I'm gonna leave them some money here

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.470
so they know they're going the right way.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.941
Or a random person's
just gonna find a grand.

00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:33.774
(Jimmy chuckles)

00:01:33.774 --> 00:01:34.607
- [The Boys] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

00:01:34.607 --> 00:01:35.884
- [Nolan] It says open 11 to five.

00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:38.443
- [Kurt] See if we can
actually get right through it.

00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:39.309
- [Chris] Ooh.

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:40.142
- [Kurt] Here we go.

00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:40.975
- [Jimmy] It was right,
right, left, right,

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.150
left, right, right, left.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.983
Perfect. Okay.

00:01:42.983 --> 00:01:44.070
If you're in the cave,
you're in the right spot,

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.030
which means if we go here,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.770
now we are officially in the watch tower.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.450
We can see the entire maze.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.470
- I'm gonna do a perimeter check.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.430
Make sure he is not outside.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.720
We gotta find the getaway car.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.100
- Hey Karl, come on.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.562
- There's that nerd.
- Hey, there he is!

00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:55.395
- Ooh!
- Okay!

00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:56.340
- [Jimmy] I bet you can't get me.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.860
- Ooh. The only exit is right here.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.750
- [Chris] Why is there money over here?

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.583
- That was just to let you know

00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:02.850
you were going the right way.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.290
- [Chris] Jimmy, we're almost there.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.123
Just wait.

00:02:05.123 --> 00:02:06.029
- Oh, they are getting close.

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:07.286
Shoot, okay. We gotta go, we gotta go.

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:08.119
They're getting closer.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.431
I don't know how long I
planned on staying there.

00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:10.264
(Tareq laughs)

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:11.097
- [Chris] He's older than us,

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:12.240
but he's got so much more energy.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.367
Isn't this where Jimmy was?

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:14.220
- [Kurt] Yes, it was.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.620
- I know you're looking at this, Jimmy.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.880
I'm taking your camera now.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.800
- The only exit outside
of this entire maze

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.700
is all the way up there,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.440
which is why yesterday
we put in a secret door.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.570
- [Tareq] Oh wow. Jimmy, this is crazy.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.800
Wait, Jimmy, is that our getaway car?

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.750
- Notice how this says,
"Authorized Maze Personnel Only".

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.697
Now it says, "Jimmy's Getaway Car".

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.024
- [Kurt] Hey guys, let's
go back to the car.

00:02:32.024 --> 00:02:34.050
The tracker's showing him up on the hill.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.118
- [Karl] All right. To the car!

00:02:35.118 --> 00:02:36.099
- [The Boys] Let's go!
- [Kurt] Let's go-

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.304
- [Karl] Go, go, go, go, go.
- [Nolan] Get in.

00:02:37.304 --> 00:02:39.390
- I wonder if they've noticed
we're not in the maze anymore.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.530
- [Nolan] He's getting on the highway.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.363
- [Chris] Which way? Left or right?

00:02:41.363 --> 00:02:42.210
- Right.
- Right.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.286
- We can make all the
mistakes in the world-

00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:44.119
- Doesn't matter-

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.952
- He's just gotta make one-

00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:45.785
- He gotta make one.

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:46.618
- Yeah.

00:02:46.618 --> 00:02:48.270
- Yo, there were parts where
we were so close to them

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.103
in the maze.

00:02:49.103 --> 00:02:49.936
That was terrifying.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:50.769
If they would've caught us there,

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.230
this video would've been
only like two minutes.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.063
I made a mistake.

00:02:53.063 --> 00:02:54.480
Tareq's supposed to be
driving. Let's switch.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.313
- [Tareq] Let's switch.

00:02:55.313 --> 00:02:56.520
- Karl is the, is that money real?

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.020
- Oh, it's real real.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.853
- Oh good.

00:02:58.853 --> 00:02:59.686
(boys laughing)

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:00.519
- And the reason Tareq is driving,

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.352
is because I need to put on a disguise.

00:03:02.352 --> 00:03:04.184
(soft, exciting music)

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.157
I look so old.

00:03:05.157 --> 00:03:08.370
Now we put the hat on, throw
on a pair of glasses, and boom.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.420
I'm Boomer Jim.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.530
And we're heading to Walmart

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.690
where I'm gonna try to
blend in with normal people.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.580
- Do you think he went to the mall to shop

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.750
and we all go shopping?

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.490
- We're pulling up to Walmart
and I'm gonna go inside

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.350
with the hundred thousand
dollars and the tracker.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.640
There's a pickax back here.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.050
And while they're inside searching for me,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.270
you need to pop all the tires
on their car to strand them.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.830
- Jimmy, I've never
popped a tire in my life.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.663
- Let's do this.

00:03:26.663 --> 00:03:27.551
- [Chris] Wait. It says
we're on top of him-

00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:28.384
- [The Boys] Hey!

00:03:28.384 --> 00:03:29.217
- [Kurt] Yeah. It says
we're right on top of him-

00:03:29.217 --> 00:03:30.276
- Take a, take a right down here-

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:31.109
- [Karl] He's right here.

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.190
- Don't let me down
with popping the tires.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.090
- [Tareq] I won't. God speed.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.850
- Park away from cars and
let's assess the situation.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.720
- And now I'm inside Walmart.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.700
And before I blend in, I
need to disguise this bag.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.650
Now I'm gonna take the hundred
thousand dollar backpack

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.722
and put it in this bag.

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.440
Now they'll never catch me.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.550
- You and I will go inside.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.930
You two stay, stay together.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.190
And let's see if we can search 'em out.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.660
Inside! Hold his hand, there ya go.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.677
- We're staying together.

00:03:49.677 --> 00:03:50.610
(phone ringing)

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.443
- Are they here yet?

00:03:51.443 --> 00:03:53.430
- They're walking out right
now. They're going inside.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.330
- All right. They're going inside?

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.163
- Yes, yes, yes.
(phone call ends)

00:03:55.163 --> 00:03:56.043
- The boys are about to
come inside. We gotta go.

00:03:56.043 --> 00:03:57.630
- [Tareq] They have no idea

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.760
I'm gonna smash all their tires.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.690
Look at 'em running.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.110
- [Chris] Looking for a six foot four guy,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.640
with a weird beard.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.900
- I can literally see the boys

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.040
walking down the gaming aisle.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.690
- I know that Jimmy told
me to pop all the tires,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.523
but I'm just gonna do one.

00:04:10.523 --> 00:04:12.180
Cuz I think I'm running low on time.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.308
FBI? More like, FB flat tire!

00:04:14.308 --> 00:04:16.199
(air hissing)

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.940
(Tareq running)

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.780
Oh, I gotta get the camera.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.230
- He's not walking around
anywhere. He's gotta be hiding.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.063
(phone ringing)

00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:22.896
- [Jimmy] Did you do the deed?

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:23.729
- The deed is done.

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.930
- They're so close to me.
I'm getting outta here.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.800
- [Tareq] Hurry up, grandpa.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.970
- I can't believe that worked.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.220
They were literally one
aisle beside me at one point.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.360
- What's the tracker say?

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.920
- [Kurt] The tracker's
moving. The vehicle's moved.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.753
- Wait, it's moving?
- In the parking lot?

00:04:32.753 --> 00:04:34.230
- He's outta the...he's outta Walmart?

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.480
- It feels amazing to have that mask off.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.860
We've knocked over a telephone pole,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.300
had a goose chase through a maze,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.490
and then hid in a Walmart as an old man.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.810
And the video's just getting started.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.550
I have so much more cool stuff planned.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.050
Like I'm literally heading to the airport

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.760
to board a private jet right now.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.593
- Wait a second!
- What's that?

00:04:48.593 --> 00:04:52.020
Who popped our tires?
There's a pickax in our tire.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.730
- Well, if we don't have a
car, we're gonna change a flat.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.766
- [Nolan] Do you know
how to change a tire?

00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:56.130
- Of course I know how to change a tire.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.102
- [Chris] Remember you wanna go two or-

00:04:57.102 --> 00:04:58.179
(car falling)

00:04:58.179 --> 00:04:59.416
Yeah. That's why I don't like those jacks.

00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:00.360
- [Kurt] Yep.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.193
- Karl?

00:05:01.193 --> 00:05:02.026
- [Karl] Yeah?

00:05:02.026 --> 00:05:03.210
- Do you know where I
was hiding at Walmart?

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.043
- No!

00:05:04.043 --> 00:05:05.700
- Basically I put on an old man suit,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.650
changed my clothes, and used a cane.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.690
Did you see a really old guy limping?

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.763
- I don't pay attention to old people.

00:05:10.763 --> 00:05:13.140
- Well if you did see one
in Walmart, it was me.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.040
Good luck, nerd!

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.873
(phone call ends)

00:05:14.873 --> 00:05:15.706
- Brah!

00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:16.539
(Chris groaning)

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:17.372
- [Nolan] Chris, you working hard?

00:05:17.372 --> 00:05:18.840
- [Chris] You're hardly working.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.860
- We're getting close to the airport.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.660
I'm gonna call the private jet
and make sure they're ready.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.640
- It looks like he's on a taxiing runway.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.590
- He's gonna get in a plane and fly away.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.787
- This is why he slashed the tires.

00:05:26.787 --> 00:05:29.340
- And there's our private jet. Let's go.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.380
I'm getting on a private
jet with the dumbest outfit

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.520
and a Cars backpack.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.720
What am I doing with my life?

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.770
Come on. You're taking forever.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.170
I'm gonna try to time it where
the private jet takes off

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.390
when they get here so they
can see me flying away.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.320
- What's up, Jimmy?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.000
- Hey buddy. How far away are you?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.580
- We're at the Walmart
man. Still fixing the tire.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.417
- Okay. Well-

00:05:45.417 --> 00:05:48.180
- Hey Jimmy, if you had to
pick a terminal to go into,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.920
would it be the passenger terminal?-

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.210
- Oh, so that means you're here.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.440
Pilot, you can take off.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.593
- [Chris] Run, run, run.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

00:05:54.593 --> 00:05:57.000
(upbeat music)

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.950
- [Kurt] Last door.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.930
- Later, nerds.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.280
- That's him.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.968
That's him on that jet right there.

00:06:03.968 --> 00:06:04.953
- [Karl] Dude!

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.420
- I have no idea how they're
gonna track where we're going.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.350
- We're gonna follow the airplane.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.610
Let's check inside where it's going.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.540
- Can we just do that?

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.680
- Yes. Why not?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.850
- Oh. I guess he is FBI.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.683
- How you doing? FBI.

00:06:15.683 --> 00:06:17.997
Where did the airplane that
just left, where is it going?

00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:19.177
- Uh. Washington, D.C..

00:06:19.177 --> 00:06:20.010
(boys gasp)

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.090
- [The Boys] What!
- Wonderful.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.830
- Is there another flight
to Washington, D.C.?

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.663
- [Kurt] Anytime soon.

00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:25.303
- I don't see anything today. No.

00:06:25.303 --> 00:06:27.210
- Do we have to drive all
the way to Washington, D.C.?

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.067
That's like-
- Hey, at least we got-

00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:28.900
- Three hours!

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.910
- We gotta, we gotta new
tire for it. So we're good.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.750
- New tire. Let's go.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.400
- Private jet with stacks of money?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.250
For the first time ever, I
actually feel like a YouTuber.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.040
And now we're in Washington, D.C..

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.570
We got about a three hour lead.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.580
And conveniently our driver is Nick.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.140
You might remember him from this video.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.717
He's so much nicer when
he's not chasing me.

00:06:44.717 --> 00:06:46.071
- Ha ha! You ready to get outta here?

00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:46.904
- Let's go.

00:06:46.904 --> 00:06:47.737
- Let's go.

00:06:47.737 --> 00:06:48.590
- Guys! He just landed in D.C..

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.423
- [Chris] What?

00:06:49.423 --> 00:06:50.256
- [Karl] Actually?

00:06:50.256 --> 00:06:51.089
- [Nolan] Yeah.

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:52.260
- That's over two hours away now still.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.880
- Are we finally in Washington, D.C.?

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.840
- Holy cow-
- What does it say-

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.250
- Wait, Washington the state?

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.240
Cuz that would suck.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.730
- And now we're at our
next location; the U-Store.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.960
So like we talked about on the phone,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.793
distract the boys, okay?

00:07:01.793 --> 00:07:02.626
- Okay.

00:07:02.626 --> 00:07:05.520
- He's right beside Costa Rica trading.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.140
Whatever that is, it's right beside it.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.940
- I just bought this storage locker

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.617
and I'm gonna put this sign
right here with this message:

00:07:11.617 --> 00:07:14.040
"Time is running out. I was in the box."

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.860
If that doesn't make any sense,
just gimme a few seconds.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.140
- Maybe we can approach from the back.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.628
- Hey, I tried that
with your mom one time.

00:07:20.628 --> 00:07:21.810
(boys laughing)

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.520
- Me and you are gonna
hide in these boxes.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.410
We're literally about
to get shipped alive.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.490
- Jimmy, what is this?

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.450
What do you have me doing bro?

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.379
- Oh, that was probably
the worst drive ever.

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:30.212
- Ahhh!

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.610
- Karl. You stay here
and watch the vehicle.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.230
Make sure no one pops our tire again.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.372
- I'll sit right here.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:36.570
- [The Boys] You're standing.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.220
- I'm wondering if you've
seen this individual.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.297
- Oh yeah, I saw him.

00:07:39.297 --> 00:07:40.130
- Still around here?

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.537
- Yeah. I think he's downstairs.

00:07:41.537 --> 00:07:42.370
Let me take you there.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.203
- Downstairs!
- Downstairs?

00:07:43.203 --> 00:07:44.036
- Downstairs?

00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:45.660
- Should we just be
following random people

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.680
to their basement?

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.610
Is this okay?

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.490
I just don't understand why
all this is necessary, Jimmy.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.690
- Let me get something to cut it.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:52.890
Can you wait for me here, sir?

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:53.723
- Yeah.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.490
- That truck you see
right here is my getaway.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.157
I'm being transported right now.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.193
Karl was right above us.

00:08:01.193 --> 00:08:02.193
- Holy crap.

00:08:03.968 --> 00:08:05.027
(blade cutting)

00:08:05.027 --> 00:08:06.527
- [The Boys] This is so extra!

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.483
Hey, here we go.

00:08:08.483 --> 00:08:10.500
- [Chris] "Time is
running out. Karl sucks.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.333
I was in the box."

00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:13.020
- Hey, hey. Check the tracker right now.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.100
- [Chris] We're gonna have to go upstairs

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.270
to get service, to check.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.164
- Are we free to get out?

00:08:16.164 --> 00:08:17.714
- [Tareq] Um. Hold on. Not yet.

00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:23.190
- I got Jimmy right here. He's gone.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.023
He's long gone-

00:08:24.023 --> 00:08:24.856
- Here's the thing.

00:08:24.856 --> 00:08:26.820
There was a box truck when we got here.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.320
He's gone in the box truck!

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.550
- [Karl] Guys! Where have you been?

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.471
- Come on. We just gotta go.

00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:32.700
- I can't believe that worked.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.800
Up next, we're going to a private island.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.420
- Jimmy looks like he's crossed a bridge

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.680
and now going to a boathouse.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.970
- Oh my goodness.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.460
So we got a plane, a boat, a box truck.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.690
What else is he gonna do?

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.130
- Thanks for the trip. Have a good day.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.360
Even though that was really cool.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.190
The box truck moves incredibly slow,

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.420
so they could be here any second.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.253
What's up, man?

00:08:49.253 --> 00:08:50.086
You ready to take us to the island?

00:08:50.086 --> 00:08:50.919
Let's do this.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:51.840
- Jimmy's calling. What's up, Jimmy?

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.130
- [Jimmy] Okay. What up, Chris?

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.180
Hey, how's it going?

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.076
You getting in a boat?

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.210
- No, actually I'm not.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.560
- That's a nice pier you're at.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.210
- Wait. Where are you?

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.600
- Maybe we might be about to
tackle you in about 10 seconds-

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.130
- Maybe I'm under-
- I hung up.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.828
Look now we're turning the tables.

00:09:06.828 --> 00:09:09.270
He thinks we're right
by him and we're not!

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.250
- Wait. I was calling him
to brag about the boxes,

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.390
but now I'm confused.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.510
- [Karl] There are so many
boats here. What is going on?

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.343
- All right. There he is go, go, go, go.

00:09:16.343 --> 00:09:17.490
- [Tareq] That's Karl. That's Karl.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.540
- You nerd!

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.373
- [Tareq] They're coming!
- [Jimmy] Go, go, go.

00:09:19.373 --> 00:09:20.206
- [Tareq] They're coming in strong.

00:09:20.206 --> 00:09:21.570
- I got you some swan boats.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.100
- It's always boats with you.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.990
- Hey, get to pedaling
on your little swan.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.823
- We'll go after him-

00:09:25.823 --> 00:09:26.656
- Go.
- Go!

00:09:26.656 --> 00:09:27.489
- We'll get in the next one.

00:09:27.489 --> 00:09:28.322
- I'm gonna be honest.

00:09:28.322 --> 00:09:29.400
I never tested those swans.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.110
For all I know, they could be really fast.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.040
- Wow. This is slow.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.990
This is unreasonably slow.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.000
- Did you ever chase
anyone on a swan before?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.833
- This will be a first.

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:38.040
`- I'm gonna act like the boat broke.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.940
Hey, Karl!

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.773
- Yes?

00:09:39.773 --> 00:09:40.980
- My boat isn't working.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.210
So I'd hurry up.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.043
- His boat's broken.

00:09:43.043 --> 00:09:44.419
Here's our chance. Hurry!

00:09:44.419 --> 00:09:45.840
(boys grunting)

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.240
- This is the most
anti-climatic thing ever.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.073
- [Tareq] Yeah.

00:09:49.073 --> 00:09:50.970
- You got four hours left
until I keep the hundred grand.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.803
See you later.

00:09:51.803 --> 00:09:52.740
- You'll pay!

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.090
- And now we're at the island.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.230
Hurry up, nerds!

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.520
- Come on over, let's talk.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.470
The sun's not even down yet, my friend.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.490
- They just docked.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.323
- [Tareq] Go, go, go, go. They're close!

00:10:00.323 --> 00:10:01.156
- [Chris] Hey, come on, guys.

00:10:01.156 --> 00:10:01.989
- [Kurt] You're going right in.

00:10:01.989 --> 00:10:02.822
You're fine.

00:10:02.822 --> 00:10:03.799
- What the heck are we doing?

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:06.000
- I think we're lost.
We went the wrong way.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.140
Oh where do we go? Please help us.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:07.973
Help us. Help us.

00:10:07.973 --> 00:10:09.000
We asked some people
on the island for help.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.870
Cause to be honest, I'm lost.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.852
- [Tareq] Me too.

00:10:10.852 --> 00:10:12.540
- Jimmy, I will end you!

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.973
We're stuck. We're lost.

00:10:13.973 --> 00:10:17.040
(indistinct)

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.410
Now we found a path. This has
to be where Jimmy's going.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.580
- I only have three more hours here.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.570
We need to get going here.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.270
He's on the other side of the island.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.560
- We make it outta here
without getting found,

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.330
then we're finally going
to the NFL stadium.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.320
Are you subscribed?

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.153
- Uh yeah.

00:10:29.153 --> 00:10:30.180
- [Tareq] Jimmy we don't have time.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.320
- We always have time for this.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.153
- [Tareq] That's fair.

00:10:32.153 --> 00:10:33.200
- I don't care to fact check
you. Here's some money.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.033
- Uh what?

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:35.760
- Thanks for subscribing. Now
I gotta run to regain my time.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.140
- [Tareq] Yes!

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.973
- Guys?

00:10:37.973 --> 00:10:38.806
What!

00:10:38.806 --> 00:10:40.260
Kurt. There's nothing.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.120
- We made it off the island
to our getaway vehicle.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.860
And now it's time for my
favorite part of the video.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.050
We're heading to an NFL
stadium that I rented.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.610
- We should have never got on this island.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:48.450
- Let's see where he is now.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.440
- [The Boys] Oh, he's still driving?

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.730
- He's going towards Capitol Hill.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.670
- I can't believe we rented
an entire NFL stadium.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.260
Look at how huge this place is!

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.550
This is gonna be so much fun.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.913
- [Karl] Let's get to our car. Come on.

00:10:57.913 --> 00:10:59.370
We have like two hours left.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.597
- I hate to break the bad news to you,

00:11:00.597 --> 00:11:02.400
but it ain't a spa.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.233
- What is it?

00:11:03.233 --> 00:11:04.200
- A football stadium.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.670
- He's at a football stadium?

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.930
- That sounds like running...

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.210
- I have a pre-recorded
video of me on loop

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.537
telling them they'll never find me.

00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:13.200
"You'll never find me in this stadium.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.033
Losers."

00:11:14.033 --> 00:11:15.330
Isn't that so funny?

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.280
And not only do I have
that video playing on loop,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.260
but I've filled the
stadium with mannequins

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.280
so they'll think it's me.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.200
They literally only have
two and a half hours left

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.100
to get this money.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.330
- Let's go, go, go, go, go.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.640
- Did he just rent an entire stadium?

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.410
Unbelievable. Let's see where he is.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.110
So we have, he looks
like he's in the center.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.921
- Wait, Jimmy's on the TV!

00:11:32.921 --> 00:11:33.754
- [Chris] Aw.

00:11:33.754 --> 00:11:34.587
- [Kurt] Oh no.

00:11:34.587 --> 00:11:35.420
- [Chris] Come on.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.780
- All right, I think
that's a little too much.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.490
- Oh, he tortured me for a whole day here.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.323
- Let's go get him.

00:11:39.323 --> 00:11:40.156
- Let's go get him.
- Can we go catch him?

00:11:40.156 --> 00:11:40.989
- Let's go get him.

00:11:40.989 --> 00:11:42.990
- [Jimmy] "You'll never
find me in this stadium-

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.823
- Holy cow.

00:11:43.823 --> 00:11:45.867
- "You'll never find me-
- [Kurt] Oh my Lord.

00:11:47.883 --> 00:11:49.500
- [Nolan] Look at all the mannequins!

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.930
- As you can see, the boys
just walked into the stadium.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.460
They're probably so confused.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.027
Can you cut the audio for me please?

00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:56.430
"You'll never find me in this stadium."

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.263
Wait for it...

00:11:57.263 --> 00:11:59.850
Boom. Now the audio's off. It's my time.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.310
- How did this man-
- [Jimmy] Hello, boys.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.143
- Hello?

00:12:03.143 --> 00:12:03.976
- Hello?

00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:06.565
- As you can see, there
is over 70,000 seats

00:12:06.565 --> 00:12:09.180
and unlimited rooms in this stadium.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.490
I need you guys to expect the unexpected.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.587
Cuz, I could literally be anywhere.

00:12:13.587 --> 00:12:16.260
And don't forget; you literally
only have two hours left

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.730
to win this hundred thousand dollars.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.170
Good luck!

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.323
- This place is huge!

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:21.156
- What a jerk-

00:12:21.156 --> 00:12:22.590
- Oh also, Karl's a nerd.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.366
- [Karl] Stop man! What the heck!

00:12:24.366 --> 00:12:25.890
(Jimmy laughing)

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:26.850
- Yo, this is so much fun.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.860
- Hey, hey! I saw movement in that window-

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.680
- [Chris] He has to be in a box
where he can reach this mic-

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.060
- I swear I just saw movement.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.260
- Nolan, what are you pointing at?

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.390
- I saw you! I saw movement!

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.310
- Wait, where is he pointing?

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.053
Turn to your left a little bit.

00:12:40.053 --> 00:12:40.962
- I see him!

00:12:40.962 --> 00:12:41.795
Run!

00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:43.230
- [Chris] I told you he was in a box.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.107
- And now they're coming
straight towards us.

00:12:44.107 --> 00:12:45.600
- [Tareq] Why'd you do this?

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.440
- We should probably move.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.340
- [Tareq] We should go.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.173
(Tareq and Jimmy laughing)

00:12:48.173 --> 00:12:49.006
- [Chris] He's on the run!

00:12:49.006 --> 00:12:50.100
- And now we're heading out the back way.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.793
And the cool part is, they
don't know what the back way is.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.680
Good luck, nerds. I believe in you.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.790
- Hey guys, over here!

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.635
- He just called the boys!

00:12:57.635 --> 00:12:58.468
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

00:12:58.468 --> 00:12:59.970
- Second level. He is moving around.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:00.803
- [Nolan] Kurt!

00:13:00.803 --> 00:13:01.636
- He's going that way.

00:13:01.636 --> 00:13:02.469
- [Nolan] How do we get up there?

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:03.302
- This way! Escalators.

00:13:03.302 --> 00:13:04.135
- [Jimmy] Let's go up.

00:13:04.135 --> 00:13:05.213
- [Tareq] Let's just go up?

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.491
- [Nolan] Oh no! They're not working!

00:13:08.491 --> 00:13:11.158
(intense music)

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.193
That's Jimmy!

00:13:17.643 --> 00:13:18.600
- [Jimmy] It's Nolan!

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.310
- Hurry, it's Jimmy!

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.350
- Tareq! Sacrifice yourself!

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.183
- [Tareq] Sacrifice myself?

00:13:23.183 --> 00:13:24.016
- Yeah.

00:13:24.016 --> 00:13:24.849
- [Tareq] He went that way.

00:13:24.849 --> 00:13:26.040
- [Nolan] No, he didn't, there's a door!

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.887
Get out of the way, Tareq!

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.960
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.793
- Here's my strategy.

00:13:34.793 --> 00:13:36.150
I'm gonna go fake pose like a mannequin

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.830
and pray they don't find me
for the next hour and a half.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:38.663
Okay?

00:13:38.663 --> 00:13:39.496
They've seen what I'm wearing.

00:13:39.496 --> 00:13:40.823
So I'm gonna steal this
mannequins clothes.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.260
Do I look like a mannequin?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.620
- Jimmy, come on out and play.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.630
- I know he's one of the
mannequins over there.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.100
Let's pretend like we don't know that.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.170
These stupid mannequins, man.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.820
Where is this nerd?

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.103
- [Chris] If I was Jimmy,
where would I hide?

00:13:57.072 --> 00:13:58.122
- [Nolan] Kurt? Kurt.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.203
- [Tareq] Jimmy, go, go, go, go.

00:14:06.319 --> 00:14:08.490
- [The Boys] Yes! Let's go!

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.380
- Honestly, I've been
running for like 14 hours.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.373
When he was right there, I was like,

00:14:11.373 --> 00:14:13.140
I don't feel like getting tackled.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.010
He can just have the money.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.540
What are you gonna spend
the hundred grand on?

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.684
- I'm gonna spend it on my wife.

00:14:16.684 --> 00:14:17.517
- Really?

00:14:17.517 --> 00:14:19.440
- I'm gonna make sure that
my family is enjoys it.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.273
- Aw-

00:14:20.273 --> 00:14:21.106
- that's the important thing-

00:14:21.106 --> 00:14:21.939
- That's really sweet.

00:14:21.939 --> 00:14:23.213
- One of the best
experiences I've ever had.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.950
- In our last video, I mentioned
that every single person

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.780
that buys this executive
producer shirt or hoodie

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.370
will get their name at
the end of this video,

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.530
which is why you see names on
the left side of your screen.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.000
Because that is every single person

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.380
that purchased this shirt or hoodie.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.820
And I didn't tell you
guys I would do this,

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.653
but on top of that,

00:14:36.653 --> 00:14:38.820
we also wrote every
single one of your names

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.020
on the wall of my studio.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.910
Literally every day,
when I come in to film,

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.440
I'm gonna see your name on this wall.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.290
Like Peter Wild, when I film,
I'm gonna be reminded of you.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.940
And same with Knox and
Knox Tucker and Koda

00:14:50.444 --> 00:14:51.277
and Koda G and all these Michaels.

00:14:51.277 --> 00:14:53.250
And on top of that,
Chandler, bring it on in.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.451
I also got all your
names put on this Tesla.

00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:59.820
That's right. Not only are all
your names on my studio wall,

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.740
but your names are also on this Tesla.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.850
And this is the fun part.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.430
Chandler, I want you to pick
a random name on this Tesla

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.560
and we're gonna give it to
them in like 30 seconds.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.460
All right, let's do it.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.020
Matt Liggett.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:10.853
- [Jimmy] What about him?

00:15:10.853 --> 00:15:12.150
- [Chandler] He didn't win.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.983
- [Jimmy] Oh, he didn't win?

00:15:12.983 --> 00:15:14.220
Well, tell me when you have the winner.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.770
- Hey Jimmy, you have
Peyton Chicken Nugget

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.000
as one of your fans.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.130
- Can you investigate that?
See if that's their real name.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.390
- I'm thinking probably not.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.010
- Derpyfish, 89.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.630
I told you to use your real name,

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.567
but I didn't actually fact check it.

00:15:25.567 --> 00:15:27.210
You go in the S category.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.830
There's a bunch of Sponge Bobs.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.210
And I know your names aren't SpongeBob.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.050
- Jimmy!

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:31.883
- Yeah?

00:15:31.883 --> 00:15:33.000
- Tell me when to stop.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.210
- Uh, wait for it, now stop.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.320
- Oh. Which finger?

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.370
- I'm a pinky kinda guy.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.350
- Alexander Hedge, this Tesla...

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.183
- [The Boys] Yeah! All right-

00:15:41.183 --> 00:15:42.390
- I don't know if that made any sense.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.496
Congratulations, Alexander.
You just won a brand new Tesla.

00:15:45.496 --> 00:15:46.970
Sorry that it's covered in names.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.180
If you want, you can remove 'em.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.140
Thank you so much.
