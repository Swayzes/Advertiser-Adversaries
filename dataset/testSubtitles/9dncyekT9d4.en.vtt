00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470
When my fellow YouTubers need help, they know who to call.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:06.639
Not them!

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.141
Me!

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:12.312
And based on ElectroBoom's setup, he should have done it a long time ago.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:16.916
You have 6 million subscribers and you make your videos on this laptop?

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:21.454
It's oozing goo, and the power adapter looks like a fire hazard.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.223
Don't unplug it, the battery's dead.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.091
Oh, you shut down the computer now.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.327
Well, no more, Gadies and Lentlemen!

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:32.932
ElectroBoom is getting an upgrade courtesy of Origin PC, who is sponsoring this video

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:37.137
and will be giving away one of their PCs to one of our lucky viewers.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.839
As for you, dude, we've got everything!

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.644
We've got a computer, a NAS, a TV, a camera, streaming gear.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:49.282
I knew if I believed in Santa, his elf would show up.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.451
How are we going to get this all in the room?

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.154
How about we just don't give you all of it?

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.255
What?

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:59.325
Uh, or maybe we could give you all of it, but you have to earn it?

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:00.326
Please?

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.327
Sir?

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.328
Ah!

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.329
Ah!

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.330
What did he say?

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.434
Before we get started on the room upstairs, we want to take a look at what we're working

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:11.204
with, and this is your network closet?

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.206
And there's more!

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.608
You know, not bad!

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:19.245
Everything's tucked away, the place looks amazing, but it's actually got a fair amount

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.246
of tech in it.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.483
NAS thermostats, got, uh, wait.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:27.420
I have a Wi-Fi for upstairs and a different one for downstairs.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.355
That's not good.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.356
What's wrong with that?

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.692
We're going to get all that sorted out with some gear from Ubiquiti.

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:35.528
You'll just automatically roam between all the different access points.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:37.097
And one name for the entire house.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.798
One name for the entire house!

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.166
Everyone will be named Mehdi.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.334
Ah, great!

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:44.170
And they'll all have eyebrows like this.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.171
That works.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.774
But a question that I have is, there's so much stuff here, are you planning to share

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.410
any of it with the other Mehdis who live here?

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.411
You know, I mean...

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:52.712
You have a family, right?

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.082
I do, but I mean, I keep as much as I can for myself.

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:59.052
We got you a desktop!

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.820
What do you need the Framework laptop for?

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.821
Oh, that one?

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:05.892
That one, I think my daughter can use that one, although I also dropped mine.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:09.462
I don't know.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.097
I also have a problem with that.

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:14.434
Now you would think that since Linus is an investor in Framework, he would know every

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.302
inner working about the laptop.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.238
But Mehdi, I want you to put him to the test.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:22.008
I bought dog shock collars because I didn't think he had enough gear already.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.978
It goes from a zero to a hundred.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.247
Every minute, you're adding one, Mehdi.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.649
Once he gets the boot, you hit the button.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.650
What?

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.019
I get shocked no matter what I do?

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.020
Yes, sir.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.555
I would do anything for my craft.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.491
Ow, ow, hey, you're not allowed to press the button yet.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.761
Yeah, just testing, you know, we have to do a test run always.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.897
I started the timer, you better get on.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:44.898
What?

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:45.899
You started the timer?

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:46.900
Yeah, is it working still?

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.901
Can you not?

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:48.902
It's still working, yes.

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:49.903
You're not allowed to slow me down.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:50.870
What is this, a notebook?

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:56.209
Well, the DIY edition comes with everything disassembled, so you have to put it together

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.210
yourself.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.713
That way you could choose if you wanted to bring your own RAM or your own SSD.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:04.884
If you build it, if you build it yourself the first time, can you not?

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.553
Stop throwing stuff around, okay?

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:11.591
Then you will be amply prepared for any repairs or upgrades that you might want to do in the

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:12.592
future.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:13.593
How's two?

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:14.594
You're supposed to wait till the end.

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:15.595
Wait till the end?

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:16.596
No, wait till the end.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.332
Here, you unbox this.

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.333
Make yourself useful.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.969
The idle hands, devil's play thing and all that.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.239
Gone with 16 gigs of DDR4 from Crucial.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.840
ESD protected or something?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.576
Am I not going to break it?

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.177
I wouldn't guarantee that.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.178
Yeah.

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:34.180
Should I test to see if it is protected?

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.316
No, no, no, no.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:42.155
Personally, I like to have the mouse on the right, and so I don't like to have my USB-A

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.156
on the right.

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.258
Ow, ow, ow, damn, that really hurts.

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.793
Stop dropping my stuff, okay?

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:47.794
Ow.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:50.263
Okay, I'm turning it on, I'm turning it on.

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:51.698
Uh-oh.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.901
Give me the power adapter, give me the power adapter.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.769
I had nothing to do with that.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.770
Yay!

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.773
Go ahead, hit him.

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:01.774
Just eight?

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:02.775
That's all it took?

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:03.776
Ow, ow, ow, damn, ow.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:06.779
Ow, ow, ow, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:07.780
Ow.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.750
Wow, that's really intense.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.752
Let me see how it feels.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:13.753
On the neck.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:14.754
Ow!

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:15.755
What the hell?

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:16.756
That was terrible.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.191
I told you.

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:19.726
No one should buy this thing.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:23.796
I'm fine with, you know, consenting adults playing around with this, but putting this

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.632
on a dog, not cool.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:26.633
Your neck is red.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.635
Yeah, because you hit it like four times.

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:29.636
You know what?

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.771
This side is red too, so it's okay.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.173
That was very fun, and I'm not upset at all.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:38.811
Incidentally, Elijah, I've got a few tasks for you, they're not gonna be a lot of fun.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:39.812
Okay.

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.080
Can you figure out the monitor mounts?

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.081
Yep.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:43.082
You can put together the chair.

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:44.083
Yep.

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.351
And can you figure out the TV wall mount?

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:46.352
I don't want to mount a TV.

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:47.820
That'd be great, thanks.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.122
Yes, sir.

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:50.523
Take care.

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:51.524
I always try.

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:53.326
Meanwhile, a wild Jake appears.

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.327
Hi!

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.695
I see we are fixing up the networking.

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.630
We got a PoE switch, are we?

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.631
That's not a PoE switch.

00:04:58.631 --> 00:04:59.799
Oh no, this is that 10 gig.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:00.800
This is the 10 gig one.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.135
What the hell does he need a 10 gig switch for?

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.202
For the NAS?

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:04.937
So that'll live in his office.

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:05.938
Oh!

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:09.976
And then the network closets are gonna get a PoE switch and some access points.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.878
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what makes the most sense.

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:17.216
He has a lot of cables in there right now, and I have like the exact amount I need, probably.

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:18.217
These things are sick.

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:19.285
Have you seen these before?

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:20.286
No, what is this?

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.021
This is a U6 InWall Enterprise.

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:27.327
It's a 2.5 gig Wi-Fi 6E access point, but it also has a switch on the bottom.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.328
Oh, that's so cool.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.762
And the switch also has PoE password.

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:30.997
We don't need that.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.334
But these are like the best thing ever for behind a TV.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:39.038
Not that we would normally recommend putting an access point behind a large metal object

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:44.444
necessarily, but if it's kind of nearby or if it's only serving a very small area, it's

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:45.678
a super clean way to install it.

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.581
I have them behind my TVs, and they're totally fine.

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:52.251
Meanwhile, Mehdi, have you ever built a computer before?

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.252
Nope.

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.620
Broken computers before.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.923
You are going to build a computer.

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:59.092
Usually you start with the motherboard.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.093
Is that the motherboard?

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:01.160
Absolutely.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.795
This is gonna be for your NAS.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:07.600
Origin sponsored this video, so they sent over a sick gaming editing PC.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.001
You don't have to worry about any of that.

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:10.002
You're doing great so far.

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.804
Do you need some guide-

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:12.805
Smells new.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:18.378
Intel just issued a warning about this, and I was like, who needs this warning?

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.379
About what?

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.380
Smelling the board?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.781
I always smell my board.

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:24.917
Smelling the exhaust of their devices.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:27.653
That's how you know if your board is broken or not.

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:32.358
Right out of the gate, this is a little bit of a hard mode build because this very unusual

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:38.598
motherboard from ASRock Rack has an AM4 socket for the CPU, so that's for AMD.

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:44.237
But it comes with a backplate and a cooler mounting pattern that would be for Intel.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:47.874
So in order to get a cooler on this thing, Jake had to pry this backplate off, which

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:51.811
was glued, thank you very much ASRock Rack, and he knocked off this resistor.

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:52.812
What?

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:55.815
I want a refund.

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.316
Sure.

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:58.317
Thank you.

00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:01.554
Traditionally, the first thing we install is a CPU.

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:02.555
What is this?

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:03.556
Oh, that's a fan.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:04.557
That's the cooler.

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:08.194
It doesn't fit on here because...

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:09.195
Intel mounting.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.196
Okay.

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:11.898
I need to supervise what's going on here.

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:12.899
These pins...

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:13.900
Don't touch it.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.901
Where's the gold?

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:15.902
There's a gold triangle.

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:16.903
Oh, there.

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:17.870
This is.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.871
Yes.

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:19.872
And that goes...

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:20.873
With the triangle.

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:21.874
But you gotta lift up the arm first.

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:22.875
Oh, lift up the arm first.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:23.876
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:26.813
Okay, arm goes down.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:27.814
Computer built.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:33.252
This is a really special SSD that uses what's called Optane, which is a really high endurance

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:34.353
kind of storage.

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:37.557
It's kind of in between storage and RAM.

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:40.560
Make it go faster.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.761
That's good.

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:43.963
You are not putting in a screw with your hand.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:44.964
No?

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:50.002
You have what is, in my humble opinion, the world's finest ratcheting magnetic screwdriver.

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.137
There you go.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.674
This is a really cool case from Jonsbo.

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:55.775
It's the N3.

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:56.943
It's super small.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:59.712
I think it looks flippin' awesome.

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:04.550
It can fit up to eight hard drives in the default configurations.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.551
You're doing awesome.

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:09.121
Well, I'm an electrical engineer.

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:10.122
I can do anything.

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.123
Oh, crap.

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:14.060
We haven't actually put the cooler on yet.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.562
Wait, you guys are using our cable management stuff, right?

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:17.563
Yeah, that's the goal.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:18.564
Okay, good.

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:22.702
Because we have new cable management products that are flippin' awesome.

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:25.972
This guy right here onto this header right there.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:26.973
Okay.

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:27.974
Okay, first thermal compound though.

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:28.975
Okay, hold on.

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.209
That's nuts.

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:31.210
I can't believe you've never built a computer before.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.211
This is so fun.

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:33.212
Well, I'm having fun.

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:34.213
Still not in.

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:35.214
How tight do I make it?

00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:36.215
I just keep going until something breaks?

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:37.216
Yeah, just keep going until it...

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:38.217
Wait.

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:39.218
Hold on.

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:43.122
It looks like this hold down is bent.

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:44.190
I just eyeballed it.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.458
You did great.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:46.459
Don't worry about it.

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.460
It's okay.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.461
Well, this is bent, but that was probably from you.

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:49.462
I'm sorry.

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:50.463
I mean, I don't think it was there before.

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:51.797
I mean, it's your computer.

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:52.598
You can do whatever you want.

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:53.032
Hit it.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:54.033
I'll fix it.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.101
That's okay.

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:56.502
There you go.

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:57.537
Like new.

00:08:58.271 --> 00:09:02.341
Normally you would just do this up the whole way, but because of the weird janky mounting

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:04.610
mechanism on this motherboard, we're not going to do that.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:10.716
And if we over tighten this, we're going to flex the bottom of the socket down, potentially

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.952
deforming or breaking those traces.

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:18.057
I have personally killed motherboards like this that have sort of weird mounting mechanisms,

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:23.696
not realizing that it was being over tightened because that's not typically how it works.

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:24.697
This is a pretty cool board.

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:29.101
It'll take up to two 110 millimeter M.2s, so you can get some higher capacity or high

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:32.238
performance ones that are a little longer than the standard 80 mil.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:37.443
And while it doesn't have an onboard PCIe switch that allows you to just use it in any

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:41.080
slot you want, this one requires a motherboard that supports bifurcation.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.582
They do have one like that as well.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.050
So appreciate you StarTech.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.552
Thanks for sending this over.

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:53.693
Now that that's done, it seems like this is a perfect opportunity to show you the system

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.695
that Origin PC sent over.

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:56.696
It's really light.

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:57.697
Check it out.

00:09:57.697 --> 00:09:58.698
Oh my God.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:09:59.699
What did they put in there?

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:00.700
Yeah.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.701
No, it's fine.

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:02.702
Here, here.

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:06.072
We'll just rest it here.

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:12.244
On this side, we're looking at a 14900K, so that's a 24 core processor.

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:17.817
We've got 32 gigs of DDR5 memory and RTX 4090.

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:22.355
So this is as powerful as it gets, whether you're video editing or do you play games

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:23.356
at all?

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.057
Not really.

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:26.058
I play Tetris.

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:27.059
Like I said before.

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:30.296
Corsair kitted this thing out with a whole bunch of their IQ Link RGB.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.297
No, no.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.298
This is just the beginning.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.700
Just, just, just, just, just, just wait for it.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.701
Wait for it.

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:36.702
Things are going to get...

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:37.670
It has its own display.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.671
Yeah.

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:39.672
Things are going to get crazy in here.

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:40.673
What happens if I open this tab here?

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:41.674
Don't, please.

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:42.675
I can drain.

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:45.845
No, I will drain the system.

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:50.316
All this stuff links up together with dramatically simplified cabling compared to previous RGB

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.317
solutions.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:55.421
This is a big thing that Corsair and Origin PC wanted us to talk about because it is simpler

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:57.456
than ever to wire up a system like this.

00:10:57.456 --> 00:11:02.161
In the past, you would have had to be an electrical engineer to set up some of the RGB setups that

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.195
I've seen in the past.

00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:04.997
But this is relatively straightforward.

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:10.503
Like the fans, for example, just clip in together and then you just plug in the one end and

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:15.341
all the RGB signaling and power just runs through that click in connector.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.476
Can you play Tetris on that thing?

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:20.780
Someone's probably done it, but I don't think it's supported by default.

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:26.152
As weird as it is to put a unibrow on the CPU cooler, Origin PC is giving you a chance

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:28.254
to do the exact same thing.

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.255
That's right.

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:35.494
You can win the PC we gave Electroboom, including that Core i9-14900K and an RTX 4090.

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:39.432
All you need to do is follow the link on your screen or head to the first link in the description

00:11:39.432 --> 00:11:40.433
for your chance to win.

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:44.236
Then you'll be able to put whatever you want on the CPU cooler screen.

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:45.738
Thanks again, Origin PC.

00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:46.839
Now back to the video.

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:51.410
I think we need to answer a lot of questions about where things go before we go any further.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:56.282
I had a plan before you came, but now there's no room for anything.

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:58.451
Can we mount it on the ceiling or something?

00:11:58.451 --> 00:11:59.752
What are you even building?

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:00.753
What is that?

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:03.422
It looks like a decapitated drill.

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:04.390
Which one?

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.391
That's a time bomb.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.392
I made it for one of my videos.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:10.396
I guess it's an improvement from your projects where it just blows up without a timer.

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:14.400
Yeah, at least you can anticipate.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.402
Maybe we need to move some things out.

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.971
Before we bring anything in.

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:19.972
How about that?

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:20.973
That's a good idea, yes.

00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:23.576
Hey, Linus, if you think it's too much stuff, do you want to challenge him to a game so

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:24.577
he doesn't have to keep it all?

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:25.578
Two collars.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:28.581
You guys will choose randomly which one you're going to have.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.282
I'm going to hit the button.

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:31.283
That's the game.

00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:32.284
That's not a game.

00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:33.285
Yes, it is.

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:35.287
And we are going to put it on the lower setting, so.

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:35.988
Are you sure?

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:37.123
Yeah. Okay. Wait.

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.124
No, shoot.

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:39.225
Oh, crap. No, I-

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:40.693
I just lost the game.

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:41.393
All righty.

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:42.394
We're starting with 10.

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:43.395
What? 10?

00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:45.631
No, no, no.

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:48.167
Thank God.

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:49.168
All right.

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.169
Mehdi won one round.

00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:52.571
Give me the collars back.

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:53.572
Which one do you guys want?

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:54.573
You guys can argue.

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:55.574
I'm letting him pick this time.

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:55.975
Doesn't matter.

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:56.475
Here you go.

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:57.543
All right, hold onto it. It’s on right?

00:12:57.543 --> 00:12:58.544
It's on, right?

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:01.113
Okay, but we each hold each other’s.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.248
Oh, do we?

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:03.716
Sure yeah, that way you won't hold back.

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:05.184
Are you sure you want to do 10?

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:06.185
Yeah, we'll do 10.

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.186
Three, two.

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:08.087
Oh, dang it.

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:09.522
It's me again. Ow!

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:11.624
Thank God it wasn't me.

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:12.491
Ow!

00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:13.659
Do you want to do three of five?

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:15.261
I mean I’m losing so I guess so.

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:17.196
I can still win this.

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:18.631
And then I don't have to give him all the stuff.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.232
And then you don't have to set up all the stuff.

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:23.302
I'm just trying to say that maybe there's an incentive for you.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.470
No.

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:25.271
Three.

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:26.839
Ow!

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.674
Ow!

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.676
My neck muscles.

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:31.944
I can still win this.

00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:32.845
Which one do you guys want?

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:34.113
Oh, you're just going to take the one in that hand?

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:35.114
I mean-

00:13:35.114 --> 00:13:36.115
Do you guys want to switch?

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:39.018
Statistically, it's like better to switch or something, right?

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:40.519
That's only if that's the three door paradigm.

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:41.320
Ah, yes. Right.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.988
That's what they want you to believe.

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.223
Okay. All right.

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:45.724
Oh my god.

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:47.493
Go.

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:48.494
Ah, dang it!

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.595
I lose, I give up!

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:50.362
I yield.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:51.163
I yield.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.898
Take as much stuff as you want.

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:56.135
This thing is so cool, but it has no way to mount it.

00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:57.136
I mean, maybe it does.

00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:58.137
I didn't read the manual.

00:13:58.137 --> 00:13:59.138
But yeah.

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:00.139
Oh.

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:01.774
LTT cable management things.

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.609
And then we'll just put these little plates in the thing.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.644
And when you want to take this off, bloop.

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:10.316
If you have something bigger that it'll fit on, this ended up being a little on the short side

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:11.884
so this is more for power bricks.

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:12.918
This is the one you want to use.

00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:14.920
So the cable tie goes on here.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.922
There's a little lip right there.

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:17.923
Grabs the end.

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:18.991
Then, uh, I don't know.

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:20.960
You can mount anything you want realistically.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.162
So let's say a banana.

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:29.401
You just wrap it around and then bippity boppity magnetic banana.

00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:31.103
How's it going, Colin?

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:33.005
You're enjoying your assembly time?

00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:36.609
Did you want to put some shelves there maybe?

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:39.478
Or maybe we can put shelves under this and then stuff go in front of it.

00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:41.580
Is this always your decision making process?

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.283
This is, uh, wow, this takes a long time.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.751
Yeah, it does, it does.

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:47.853
We have the first of your monitors though.

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:53.792
Xenion, these are OLED 27 inches and they do 240 frames a second for the gaming you

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:54.793
said you don't do.

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:55.928
But it's totally fine.

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:58.764
These are actually amazing monitors and we have two of them for you.

00:14:58.764 --> 00:14:59.899
So we're going to get these going.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:00.900
Here is your shelf.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.534
We're going to do one here.

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:06.405
Then about halfway to the top, we're going to do one more and then we're going to do

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:07.406
another one there.

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:08.407
Oh, that's great.

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.408
And you're going to have so much more storage.

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:12.177
I have my beautiful tiny stock binder.

00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:14.680
Oh, this is one of those magnetic ones.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.281
Yes.

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:19.018
Hey, we found a stud. Actually,

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:21.120
That's perfect.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.890
I would put this here.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.159
Is it not too close to the door?

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:31.163
It's a little on the tight side and one of them is going to be all drywall anchors

00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:32.097
all the time I think.

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:36.035
Hey, brilliant, okay.

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:36.902
Where did that level go?

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:40.105
We're going to level up our installation game.

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:42.474
Wait, he got the cool job.

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:44.076
I feel like a sucker.

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.013
Wow that really, that really goes.

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:49.014
That really sucks.

00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:50.015
Yeah.

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:52.952
And then it's, see, you've got the little threaded hole back there and you screw into that

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.387
they'll hold like 200 pounds or something stupid like that.

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:56.488
Screws.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:57.723
Yeah.

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.124
They, they're big boys.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:00.592
It doesn't go through that hole.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.127
Oh, no.

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.362
The IKEA hole.

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:04.964
We can expand those holes.

00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:06.398
Oh, you're just going to hold it like that.

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:08.968
I mean, I could get the vacuum.

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:14.573
All right.

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:15.107
Perfecto.

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:18.944
Because the theme of the day is not finishing anything before we move on to the next thing.

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:24.149
Now seems like a good time to talk about this musical instrument.

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:27.953
Where do you want the TV mounted in here?

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:28.954
We should move this away before you break it.

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:31.090
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.293
There used to be a crap TV mounted on the wall.

00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:35.294
Oh, wow.

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:36.295
And a crap mount for it.

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:37.596
I already have the, yeah.

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:43.936
You know, for someone who was lecturing me about stud spacing and, you know, handyman stuff, I um

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:46.005
Oh, one of them is in the stud.

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:48.540
The other one, well, the spacing wasn't good enough.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.509
Are you sure you don't want it at the right height?

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:51.844
What's the right height?

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:55.180
You know how nobody likes to sit in the front row of the theater?

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:56.015
Yes.

00:16:56.615 --> 00:16:57.116
Okay.

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:59.952
So the right height is so that you don't do that.

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:04.323
I noticed your other TV is above a fireplace and mind just about exploded.

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:06.792
What did you do to my room, for God's sake?

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:08.394
Why did you put the garbage up there?

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:09.395
I made space.

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:11.296
Good. At least the shelves are holding up.

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:11.864
Yeah.

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:15.401
And none of the togglers fell into the wall.

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:18.570
That's a real plus.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.406
Okay one toggler fell into the wall.

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:21.006
Did it?

00:17:21.273 --> 00:17:24.877
One second I don't look at what you're doing and, oh my God.

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:31.050
You'll still need a display port cable just because this is just an uplink for the hub for data.

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:34.686
Right. So this handles all of your actual display data.

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:35.254
Yeah.

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:38.991
Isn't that awesome?

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:40.459
Look how strong they are.

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:44.696
We somehow convinced Medhi's lovely wife to have an access point in her office.

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:47.132
So at the very least, what's your favorite color?

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:49.368
Green? Green? Okay.

00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:50.202
Let's try this.

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:51.770
That looks not like green.

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:53.439
Let’s go with orange.

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:54.373
Orange? Okay.

00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:56.208
Okay. Cool. Yeah.

00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:00.846
With the frame TV, the Samsung uses this one connect cable.

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:04.616
And basically you just put this one cable into the back of the TV.

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:06.819
It runs to this box here.

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:11.690
And with this box here, this is where you can put all your inputs of HDMI, ethernet.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.494
That's where the one connect cable connects, power, pretty much everything comes through

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:16.161
this box here.

00:18:16.728 --> 00:18:17.596
Don't trip Colin.

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:20.199
I don't want to, don't want a work safe hazard.

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:23.669
Totally ate it.

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:24.470
Think we’re on, yeah?

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.476
I made a big boo-boo.

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:31.477
So we're going to try again.

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:33.278
We're going to use the frame’s mount.

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:35.347
I didn't think it came with one, but it does.

00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:36.348
And I messed up.

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:40.419
So what the hell dude?

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:42.654
You know, you told me that this was no problem.

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:47.759
All of your power bars plugged into power bars, but you know what I see?

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:48.760
What do you see?

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.830
I see a big problem because I'm looking at this side.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:58.137
Well, that problem is me, not the series power connection.

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.938
You'll probably have seen it in one of my videos.

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:03.876
Wait, these two were already plugged

00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:06.345
into another power strip.

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.313
To be clear, Mehdi is an electrical engineer.

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:09.414
He knows what he's doing.

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:14.253
He knows how to add up the total current of all the downstream devices on all of his different

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:18.090
octopuses that are connected to things and make sure that they don't exceed the maximum

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.793
amperage that each one of these sockets can support.

00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:28.033
Except that even though he does know what he's doing, he seems to make a lot of mistakes.

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:29.034
What?

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:30.035
That's what I do.

00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:33.172
What the hell?

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.640
What is this?

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.043
I needed the ground connection.

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:44.650
I use that for when I walk on my treadmill because I noticed I pick up charge when I

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:49.922
walk on the treadmill and I have my headphones in, which is connected to the laptop, which

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:51.089
is connected to the ground.

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:55.460
So when I'm charged, it zaps me right in the ear.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.929
So I had to ground myself.

00:19:56.929 --> 00:20:00.566
These are better for running cables along the direction of the magnets.

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:02.768
Am I the first person to receive this?

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:03.635
Actually, yes.

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:04.236
Awesome things.

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:08.307
You are the first person outside of Linus Media Group to try these.

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:09.474
Okay.

00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:15.514
I went to spin this drill and it just popped through the drywall and now it's like,

00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:20.852
well it might be me, but why do all TV companies suck at making mounts?

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.421
It's working.

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:22.854
Okay.

00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:23.855
That's the TV.

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:24.856
Good job.

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:28.460
IGMP proxy, let's go.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:33.632
Basically your TV is IPTV or like TV over IP, like the internet.

00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:37.135
In a normal internet connection, it's Unicast.

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:41.373
Unicast is kind of like a sniper where you're sending the packet directly to the target.

00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:42.674
You know where it's going.

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:47.913
Well, that would be very inefficient if you had a thousand targets, right?

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:51.617
So instead they use multicast, which is kind of like a shotgun.

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:53.218
It shoots all over the place.

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:55.554
It doesn't even know where it's going really.

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:58.423
Your ISP provided router does know to look for that.

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:02.961
And so does the Unify ones if you turn on IGMP proxy, which is what we did and it works,

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:06.765
which is awesome because now we don't have to have any of the ISP crap.

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:09.167
We can just have our full Ubiquiti network.

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:12.938
Up here, we're using a Ubiquiti Switch Lite 16, which is way more ports than he needs.

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:14.740
As you can see, there's four plugged in.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.310
I left a couple extra cables over here if he needs them, but it's a lot cleaner than

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.311
it was before.

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:21.113
So you'll notice the TV is still on the floor.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.782
Did you really put extra holes in someone's wall again?

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:26.685
I put like five extra holes in someone's wall.

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:29.888
Realistically, if you ever watched our channel, you would have known better than to let him

00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:30.889
put holes in the wall.

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:31.890
I would have known better.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.891
Yeah, this is your fault.

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:35.527
Hey, it's not our fault.

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:36.528
Bye guys for the win.

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:38.163
Let's go!

00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:41.933
In all seriousness though, we tried to use that flush mount that Mehdi had.

00:21:41.933 --> 00:21:46.738
It wasn't compatible with this TV after I had mounted the wall plate.

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:50.842
So then we tried the included frame mount, which is these two brackets here.

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:51.843
Yeah, they look great.

00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:52.844
They look great.

00:21:52.844 --> 00:21:56.214
The problem is, is the drywall anchors they give you, they just free spin.

00:21:56.214 --> 00:21:57.215
Oh, yeah.

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:58.216
Okay.

00:21:58.216 --> 00:22:00.952
As long as the TV, the TV is only pulling down, right?

00:22:00.952 --> 00:22:02.120
The gravity is going this way.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.523
If it was going sideways, I would be worried.

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:07.759
We also chose the mount that makes it as close to the wall as possible.

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:10.395
So ideally you won't have any of that tipping force.

00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:10.829
Yeah.

00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:11.663
Okay.

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:12.230
So yeah.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.568
All we have to do is we have to line these bolts up with the circles there.

00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:18.570
Oh, I think I got it.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.572
Oh, see, now you can go sideways.

00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:22.541
Oh yeah, you can adjust it that way.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:25.577
Well actually, let's test it.

00:22:25.577 --> 00:22:26.578
Oh my gosh.

00:22:26.578 --> 00:22:27.579
Oh, it's fine.

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:28.580
Don't worry about it.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.581
See?

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:30.582
I told you.

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:33.618
If you get some of this clutter out of here a little bit, like...

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:35.620
It's not so bad.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.621
Dang, that's clean.

00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:38.590
It really makes the space feel bigger.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.591
This is awesome.

00:22:39.591 --> 00:22:40.592
Sweet.

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:43.595
Cool, well we actually have to plug it in.

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:47.099
And then we'll run it to that port we showed earlier.

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:50.001
If I can turn back time.

00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:50.869
Who is that?

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:51.603
Cher?

00:22:51.603 --> 00:22:52.604
Oh, okay.

00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:53.171
You don't know Cher?

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:54.139
Oh my God.

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:55.607
I didn't know who the Beatles were until six months ago.

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:57.142
Oh my God.

00:22:57.142 --> 00:22:57.609
How old are you?

00:22:57.609 --> 00:22:58.610
12?

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.611
I'm 46.

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:01.646
Wow, you're a boomer.

00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:04.649
That's what my channel is.

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:06.651
I'm an electro boomer.

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:07.652
What do I do?

00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:08.653
I don't know.

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:15.660
Sounds like Nintendo music.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.630
It's like I just booted up my Wii for the first time in 2007.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.632
It really does actually kind of look like art.

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:23.635
Like, it doesn't really lose the brightness on certain angles.

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:25.637
Like, it's pretty good.

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:27.639
What if I turn off the light?

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:28.640
Oh yeah.

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:32.677
So we're not going to use a mic on an arm.

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:34.679
You'll just put on your lav like you normally do.

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:35.680
Right.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.682
Compared to my old transmitter from Rode.

00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:38.683
Perfect.

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:39.684
Oh, wow.

00:23:39.684 --> 00:23:41.686
Everything fits in this form factor.

00:23:41.686 --> 00:23:43.688
Yeah, they've gotten a little smaller.

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:44.689
Yeah.

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:46.691
Wait, we also got him a camera.

00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:47.692
Where's the camera at?

00:23:47.692 --> 00:23:48.693
What is...

00:23:48.693 --> 00:23:49.694
EOS R8.

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:51.696
Oh my God.

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:54.699
Oh, that's a full-size sensor, isn't it?

00:23:54.699 --> 00:23:55.700
Don't spit on it.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:56.701
I wouldn't spit on it.

00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:58.737
That camera actually also upgrades you to 4K.

00:23:58.737 --> 00:23:59.738
Let's go.

00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:02.741
Maybe now with the new computer, I can edit in 4K too.

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:03.742
Oh, yeah, 100%.

00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:06.711
This thing is going to chew through 4K.

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:07.712
No problem.

00:24:07.712 --> 00:24:09.714
What's really cool about the Wireless Pro

00:24:09.714 --> 00:24:11.716
is that it has the pass-through to your camera

00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:13.718
so you can monitor your audio

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:15.720
and you can just edit directly with that.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.723
But this pack acts as both a transmitter

00:24:18.723 --> 00:24:20.725
and a local recorder.

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:21.726
That's nice.

00:24:21.726 --> 00:24:23.728
So if something goes terribly wrong,

00:24:23.728 --> 00:24:25.730
at least you have the backup audio

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:26.765
if you run the recording here.

00:24:26.765 --> 00:24:27.766
Yeah.

00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:30.769
Very first zap in 4K.

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:31.770
Hey.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:32.771
Oh my God.

00:24:32.771 --> 00:24:33.772
He zapped me.

00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:35.307
Did you see that?

00:24:36.775 --> 00:24:39.644
I almost dropped the camera, man.

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:40.779
What do you mean almost dropped it?

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:41.780
You dropped it.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.782
Well, my reflexes are very fast,

00:24:43.782 --> 00:24:44.783
so I caught it in midair.

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:46.751
And then somehow we ended up bringing you

00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:47.752
a Galaxy S23 phone.

00:24:47.752 --> 00:24:48.753
How does that...

00:24:48.753 --> 00:24:50.755
How did we get scammed into this exactly?

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:51.756
Have you seen this phone?

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:52.757
I don't know.

00:24:52.757 --> 00:24:54.759
You ask and you shall receive.

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:58.797
Although my old phone still works pretty well.

00:24:58.797 --> 00:24:59.798
It's like a...

00:24:59.798 --> 00:25:00.799
What is it?

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:01.800
S9?

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.801
Note 9, baby.

00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:04.803
Let's go 9th gen.

00:25:04.803 --> 00:25:05.804
Cheers.

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:06.805
I was told apparently

00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:08.807
you use your phone for videos, though.

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:09.808
Like occasionally just...

00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:11.810
I do, but this one does 1080.

00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:14.813
All right, so I see...

00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:16.815
Okay, just take it.

00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:18.817
Actually, what I want to talk about first

00:25:18.817 --> 00:25:19.818
is this chair.

00:25:19.818 --> 00:25:20.819
I was there.

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:23.822
I saw it had strong wife approval factor.

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:24.856
She said she actually liked it.

00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:26.858
Is this gonna fit here?

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:27.859
This is...

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:29.861
Well, as long as the door closes.

00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:30.862
Oh.

00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.831
Yeah, if you push hard enough, yeah.

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:35.834
The handles turn.

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:39.838
I just turned your monitors to 240 hertz.

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:41.840
So just go ahead, grab your mouse

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.842
and just grab this window and drag it around.

00:25:43.842 --> 00:25:45.844
Have you ever tried this before?

00:25:45.844 --> 00:25:47.846
Oh, my God.

00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:50.849
This is moving so fast.

00:25:50.849 --> 00:25:51.850
It's like...

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.851
My God.

00:25:52.884 --> 00:25:53.885
Even if you don't game,

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:55.887
I actually find a high refresh rate display

00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:57.889
just makes everything feel like...

00:25:57.889 --> 00:25:59.891
I may just use the computer.

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:00.892
More responsive.

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.894
Move windows around with it.

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:04.896
Oh, hey, the thermal camera works.

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:05.897
Look at that.

00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:07.899
Super cool.

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:08.900
There's two cameras, right?

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.604
There's the camera that gets the visible light image

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:14.573
and then there's a camera that gets the infrared image

00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:16.641
and then it just kind of superimposes them.

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:18.877
But those cameras aren't exactly in the same place.

00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:21.780
So you can see as I move around,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.416
like, my eyes kind of...

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.384
they kind of wobble around

00:26:26.384 --> 00:26:29.254
because the cameras have different frame rates, right?

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.222
The thermal camera refreshes at a much slower rate.

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:33.291
But the game, that looks good, right?

00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:35.827
Yeah, the speed is super smooth.

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:37.929
Origin PC, wicked fast, great cooling.

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:39.931
You can barely hear this thing.

00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:42.200
Oh, my God, that's quick.

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:43.935
And this is off of the NAS.

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:47.939
Do you know how easy it makes video editing for me?

00:26:52.477 --> 00:26:53.912
This is so good.

00:26:53.912 --> 00:26:54.913
Thank you.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.849
Yeah, I guess now's a good time to thank Origin PC

00:26:57.849 --> 00:26:59.250
for making this possible.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.819
They've got a giveaway.

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:02.821
You guys can check that out down below.

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:06.191
Another opportunity for us to talk about iCUE Link,

00:27:06.191 --> 00:27:07.759
all the cool RGB software.

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:08.994
So you can download that

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:11.863
and you can set it up to have all kinds of different colors

00:27:11.863 --> 00:27:12.964
or maybe your kids can play with it.

00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:14.966
This is about as top of the line as it gets.

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.968
Elijah is a sweet, precious boy

00:27:17.002 --> 00:27:18.003
and we must protect him.

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:21.006
Therefore, we didn't set up your saw.

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:24.009
We also really weren't sure where this was gonna go.

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:26.011
Oh, this bad boy goes on the table here.

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:27.012
Yeah, and then?

00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:29.014
Wait, what, on this table?

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:30.015
Yeah.

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:33.018
See, I made some planters there.

00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:37.022
If I had this, it would make life easier.

00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:40.992
And maybe the craftsmanship would be a little more exciting.

00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:41.993
You know, I was just doing it by hand,

00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:42.994
so it's all sideways.

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:43.995
You know what?

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:44.996
It's really good.

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:45.997
This looks flippin' awesome.

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:48.733
Do you guys remember the before in here?

00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:49.467
Yeah, it looks awesome.

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:52.037
We got a Switch Lite 8, Switch Enterprise 8.

00:27:52.037 --> 00:27:55.040
This is one of the in-wall 6 Enterprises,

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.043
Cloud Key, and then the little gateway light.

00:27:58.043 --> 00:28:00.045
He's like the Ubiquiti fairy.

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:04.049
He just flits into your house and Ubiquiti's everything

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:06.051
and then he leaves and there's 10 gig

00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:09.054
and fast Wi-Fi everywhere.

00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:13.058
I was getting 300, so it's pretty good, 500.

00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:14.059
What did you do?

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:15.060
That's hilarious.

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:17.095
He thought he had like 300 down, 100 up.

00:28:17.095 --> 00:28:19.097
Because his Wi-Fi sucked.

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:20.799
If you guys enjoyed this video,

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.100
maybe check out the last time we collabed

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.104
to debunk wireless grounding straps.

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:27.072
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:28.073
That was, yeah.

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:29.074
Pretty stupid.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.675
Stupid straps.

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:32.077
Or the first time we collabed

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:35.080
to determine whether static electricity

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.082
actually kills computer components.
