00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.735
- If you make this shot.

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.437
- No way.

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:05.305
- You win money.

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:07.273
And every time someone misses a shot,

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.709
I add $10,000 to the prize pool.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.746
We are currently on top
of a 250 foot bridge.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.881
Drake, if you can make that basketball

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.051
into that hoop down there,
I'll give you $10,000.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:18.885
- 10 grand?

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:19.686
- All right, bet.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:20.754
Oh wait, you're not even gonna think.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:21.721
Okay. He just shot.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.555
- Hold on.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:23.923
Oh, oh. Oh, dude.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.158
- Oh no.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.693
- It like changed last second.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.395
- That 10 grand. Sorry about it.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.529
Here's a dart, Adam.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.363
- Okay.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.932
- You hit that bullseye,
this 20 grand is yours.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.135
- That's enough to buy the house, dude.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.804
- Adam! Adam! Adam!
- I like that. I like that.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.305
And the lights, too.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.173
Okay. All right.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:47.414
- The bullseye's here.
The dart's here. Next one.

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:50.417
Chris, this is $30,000 in cash.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:55.422
And if he hits a half court shot like this

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.023
I'll give him 30 grand.

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:57.924
Did it go in?

00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:58.758
- Yeah, it did.

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.160
- I got this, I got this,
I got this, I got this.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.261
- Let's see it.
- I got this.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.396
- There's no way he's making this.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.230
- Okay. Oh.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.101
- You have three seconds.
What do you have to say?

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.803
- Yeah.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:13.139
- And now we're at a
golf course with $40,000.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.276
And if Dave here can hit
a hole in one like this,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.482
I'll give him $40,000.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.316
I know I missed.

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:24.150
I'm not even gonna try
to make a hole in one.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.652
You might remember Dave from this video

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.687
where we gave him a shot
at a million dollars

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:28.888
if he hit a hole in one.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:31.491
Oh.
- Oh my gosh.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.026
- Oh snap. Oh my gosh.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:34.027
That is so close.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.061
And you might remember you were

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.996
six feet away from a million dollars,

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.531
which is why for this shot,

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:41.034
we conveniently move the hole six feet

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:42.535
to exactly where you missed.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:45.405
Before you swing, I want
you to look at this $40,000.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:46.473
You put that in the hole.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:47.707
I put this in your trunk.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.043
Oh, he hit it.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.045
Oh, wait, wait. Let's go look.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:54.981
Clearly we didn't move the pin far enough.

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.883
Carl, I'm gonna let
you deal with this one.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.218
- Maybe Jimmy will give you a third time

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.252
trying to get a hole in one.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.687
- I like a third time.
- But not now.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:01.888
- Not now. Next time.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:04.624
- We did 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.327
And now $50,000 is on the line.

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:11.798
And for this trick shot, I'm
gonna let Carl demonstrate it.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.667
Oh my gosh. I can't believe
you did that first try.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.202
That's basically the trick shot.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.937
And Tariq, let me hold this camera.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.572
You saw what Carl just did, Tariq.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:22.041
If you could put this soccer
ball in that trash can,

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.444
I will give you $50,000 in cash.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:25.478
And here's the thing, Tariq.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.847
Carl literally did it first try, watch.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.483
- Not that one. Not that one.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.619
- If Carl can do it first try, so can you.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.155
Tariq! Tariq!

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.890
He missed it. Lost 10 grand.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.491
Now you lost 50 grand. What is that, 60?

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.860
60 is what we're about
to offer the next person.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.694
- Oh, okay.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:42.529
- If you can hit a home run,

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.031
I'll give you this $60,000 in cash.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:45.865
- Are you serious?

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.167
- And just to show it's possible,

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.968
I'm gonna demonstrate before he tries.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.303
Literally all he has to do is

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:53.740
hit a home run like that right there,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.841
and he'll get 60 grand.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.809
Noah, here is the baseball bat.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.178
Your arms are ginormous.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.913
I don't see how you
don't hit this to Mars.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.314
The next person competes for 70 grand.

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.382
This view's getting crazy.

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:03.216
Who's gonna get? Boom!

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:06.553
Whoa. Oh.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:08.788
Just where you gotta,
we gotta take the money.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:10.557
- Wait, I get to keep the
ones that fell out, right?

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:13.626
- And now we're on a
football field with 10,000,

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:16.196
20,000 30, 40, 50, 60, $70,000.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.833
And if our contestants launch a baby doll

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:23.369
from this cannon and to that crib.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.337
- It's a crib.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:27.207
- They get this $70,000 in cash.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.609
Chris, can you demonstrate
how the baby cannon works?

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.044
- Can you call me Elon Musk,

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.080
'cause I'm about to
send this baby to space.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.515
- Okay, Elon Musk.

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:36.816
Oh, it's still flying.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:37.984
It's still flying.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.452
- Yay.

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.354
- All you gotta do is take this baby,

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:42.522
cram the baby in there.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.792
All right, there we go. Let me see that.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:47.093
Launch the baby when you're ready.

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:49.362
- All right. Three, two, one.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.631
- Oh, oh, oh. No.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.568
- Do you not practice shooting
babies out of a cannon?

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:58.004
- You're not very good
at launching babies.

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.039
To be honest, I'd be
surprised if you were.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.108
Chris is sitting over top of a dunk tank

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:04.410
and I got $75,000 here.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.279
I think you know where
I'm going with this, Sam.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:07.780
- I'm pretty excited.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.782
- Sam, if you can hit that red button

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:13.653
from behind this line, you win $75,000.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:13.920
- No way.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.054
- Woo. Let's get it.

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:17.890
- One baby, one red
button. Does he hit it?

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.192
Oh.
- Oh.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.727
- Thank goodness I don't get wet.

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:23.229
- I know you're sad,
but we're gonna move on.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.833
Now we're back in the gym
with $80,000 on the line.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.167
- But you're Jim.
- I hate him.

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:30.670
Would you like a shot at
winning this 80 grand?

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.838
- Yeah.
- Put this blindfold on.

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:32.839
Now put this blindfold on.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:34.207
- Seems a little excessive, Jimmy.

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:36.509
Now three blindfolds?
- I need more blindfolds.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:37.644
Carl, you lure him around.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.312
- Why did you give Carl control?

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.947
I trust you, not Carl.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.949
- In total, there are
eight basketball goals.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.951
You get one shot and if you score

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.187
on any of these goals, you get $80,000.

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:50.523
- I'm gonna take a page
out of the bat's book

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:53.059
and I'm gonna use
echolocation to find the goal.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.928
- I feel like I'm kinda middle.

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:58.698
- I can't believe this
dude just used echolocation

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:00.800
to realize he's in the
middle of the court.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.602
How is he so smart?

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.738
- Did I make it?
- Take them off.

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:08.541
You're directly under the hoop.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:10.977
Okay, help me package up
the 80 grand you didn't win.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.313
- That's just insulting to injury.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:16.149
- This next shot was
supposed to be for $90,000

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.084
but I'm making it a
hundred because why not?

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:20.520
And I'm surrounded by 10 basketball goals.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.622
Carl's gonna go up in the
air in this helicopter

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:23.856
and demonstrate the shot.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:30.196
Drop the basketball.

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:36.035
Oh, oh!

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:38.371
- Was that in? Yes. That
was in. That was in.

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.773
- That was the hundred
thousand dollar shot.

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:43.242
If you can get in that
helicopter, make a shot,

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:45.712
I'll give you a hundred thousand dollar.

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:46.779
- Deal. Let's do this thing.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.147
- While we're waiting on the helicopter,

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:49.649
How'd that last a hundred grand treat you?

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.084
- Amazing. Changed my life forever.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:52.051
- I mean, what'd you spend it on?

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:53.052
- Paid off the cars.

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:55.655
Put some money away for
my kids' college funds.

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:56.489
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:57.390
- You know when he is not chasing me

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.991
and trying to tackle me,

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:00.126
he's a pretty nice guy.

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.162
- This ball right here, it's crazy.

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:04.797
It's not a regular ball anymore.

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:06.599
It's got the chance to
change my life forever.

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.402
- And before he shoots the $100,000 shot,

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:11.971
I'm gonna tell the pilot
to raise the helicopter.

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.639
Raise it up.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.341
- Oh, why are we going up?

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:16.175
- If you could see the look

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:19.779
on the bounty hunter's
face, he looks so confused.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.447
- No, wait. Is it fair?

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:24.050
- That looks good. Let it rain.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.052
Oh. Oh. Oh, wait.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:26.886
Oh no.

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:31.090
If we leave before the helicopter lands,

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.525
we don't have to see him when he's sad.

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.093
- It won't be awkward.

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:34.927
- Yeah, right. Next bit.

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.863
This is 100 bowling pins.

00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:40.466
and if Nolan bowls a
strike, he gets 110 grand.

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:42.568
The reason why he's doing it
is because in the island video,

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:44.771
he lost $800,000 because
he sucks at bowling.

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:45.605
- I can hear you.

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:47.540
- And before I have Nolan

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.509
attempt to knock down the 100 pins,

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.277
I'm gonna give it a try
because it looks fun.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:53.012
This is my first try.

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:56.015
I missed. I missed.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:58.251
I'm gonna show you guys a trick.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.952
Editing, it's cool.

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:03.489
Nolan, here is your bowling bowl.

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:05.158
Nolan's bowling! Nolan's bowling!

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:08.194
All right. He did it. It left his hand.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:09.762
- Oh! Oh! Go down.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:12.265
Oh, go down. Oh, oh.

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:15.468
I hate bowling!

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:16.769
- Bowling also hates you.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:20.006
He lost an $880,000 island
to bowling in this video.

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.742
He lost $110,000 to bowling in this video.

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:24.977
So if you lose another
10 grand to bowling,

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:27.180
you have lost a million dollars to it.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.948
If you knock this pin over with that pin,

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:29.916
I'll give you 10 grand.

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:30.950
- I literally couldn't mess this up.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.784
- Just throw it.

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:33.586
- No!
- All right.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:35.955
He's now lost a million
dollars to bowling.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.690
All right, I'm satisfied. Next bit.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.027
Every single challenge we've
added a $10,000 briefcase.

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:42.462
And look at how many we have.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.597
And you might be wondering,
why do we have a bathroom

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:47.366
and $120,000 in the middle of the woods?

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:49.101
Well, that's because we're gonna lift

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:51.771
this contestant right
here 100 feet in the air

00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:53.473
for this toilet paper trick shot.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.373
Don't ask questions.

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:56.843
The boom lift's starting
to get a little shaky.

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.144
- Can I shoot it now?

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.178
- Hey, a little bit more.

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.746
- My hands, my palms are sweaty.

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:02.081
- My knees are weak.

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:03.883
- I don't see no spaghetti.

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:04.984
- Oh crap. He's right.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:08.154
- 120 grand on the line. Have at it.

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:10.790
Oh, she threw it. She threw it.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.426
Oh, I felt kind of bad that

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:15.127
her toilet paper missed the toilet.

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:17.263
I can't say that with a straight face.

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:20.399
So I gave her one more try for $10,000

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.501
and she still missed.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.136
Jerry, can you confirm 10
grand is in this briefcase?

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.104
- Yes, it is 10 grand.

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.439
- Okay. $10,000.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.742
130,000. Close the trunk.

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:32.512
And this is a hammer.
Smash that window, Chris.

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:36.716
And Chris, if you wouldn't mind,

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.217
could you also smash this one,

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:41.454
which leaves this tiny
window here remaining.

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:43.256
If you can smash that tiny window.

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:44.457
- Okay.
- With that hammer,

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:48.594
I'll let you keep the car and
the 130 grand in the trunk.

00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:49.762
You look a little nervous, pal.

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:50.963
- It's not that I'm nervous.

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:52.532
It's that my arms are little boy arms.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.599
- I feel like I should back up.

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.701
Throw it as hard as you can.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:56.536
Oh, oh.

00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:00.540
- I broke some window though.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.741
I felt really bad for Wendle,

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.243
so I decided to give Nolan
a chance to redeem him.

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:07.847
That's wasn't even close.

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:10.082
That wasn't even close, but I feel bad.

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:11.784
Just take the car with
the shattered windows.

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:12.885
I'm gonna take the money

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.353
and we're gonna just
head to the next place.

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:16.956
We are now adding another $10,000,

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:19.158
bringing the total to 140 grand.

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:20.593
This is our contestant, Neal.

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:23.029
And this is my bodyguard
Shaun, who happens to be

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:24.730
ridiculously good at basketball.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.735
If you can score on Shaun,
I'll give you $140,000.

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:30.970
You get one shot.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.505
- He's standing at the free throw line

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.907
and his his checkup hand
is right in front of me.

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:35.808
He's a giant.

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:39.679
- No one said winning 140
grand was supposed to be easy.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:40.680
This is it.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.747
- You ready, Neal?
- Let's go.

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:44.216
- 140 grand on the line.

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:45.051
Let's go, man.

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:48.087
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:53.426
Oh my goodness.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.460
- That's what I'm talking about.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.695
- Since Shaun literally ripped

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:57.096
that money outta Neal's hands,

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.931
I wanted to give him a chance for a bit.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:02.802
If Shaun can score on
him, he'll get $10,000.

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.870
- I'll take that. I'll take that.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.806
- All right!
- 10 grand!

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:10.142
Did you for a second think
he was gonna score on you?

00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:11.911
- No.
- I love how confident he is.

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.046
Next we put an apple
on a mannequin's head.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:16.349
And if our contestant
can shoot the apple off,

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:21.754
- There you go.
- Then he gets $150,000.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:24.523
You can literally win more
money than you are tall.

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:26.392
Quote that. On a scale one to 10,

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:28.260
how badly do you want 150 grand?

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.595
- I'd say about a 12.

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:30.529
- 12. Okay.
- 12 or 13.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:31.564
- So you really want it.

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:33.366
Like, it would probably
change your entire life.

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:35.167
- Yeah. I could maybe even get taller.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:36.802
150 grand. Oh my gosh.

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.504
- 150 grand on the line.

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:40.873
Buy a lot of chicken nuggets
and a lot of Beast burgers.

00:10:40.873 --> 00:10:42.008
You should order Beast.

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:44.343
What did, you were about shoulder.

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:46.145
- It was left. It was left shoulder.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.980
- He was about shoulder.
- Left shoulder.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.749
- Yeah. Have a good night.

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:50.616
- Thanks, guys.

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:51.751
- Since he missed, we're gonna throw

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.653
another 10 grand up here.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.187
It's now officially taller than me.

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:56.489
See that mannequin?

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.890
Go stand where it is and get rid of it.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:58.724
- Roger.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.261
- Next contestant.

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:05.231
We're back in a gym for the
5000000th time this video.

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:08.234
Instead of one contestant,
we're gonna have five.

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:10.269
Here is $40,000.

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:13.706
The next number was 200 grand

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:15.641
and since there's five of them,
they're just gonna split it.

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:18.210
Basically, if one of you
can hit a half court shot,

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.512
you all get 40 grand.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.746
- Wait, how many chances do we get?

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:22.348
- You each get to shoot one shot.

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:25.284
If all five of you miss,
I take the briefcases back

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:26.619
and you go home with nothing.

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:28.654
- Oh all right. Let's get it.

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:33.025
- We got it. 200 K! 200 K!

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.226
- Who's shooting first?

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:35.327
- I'm taking it first.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:39.432
- Let's see it. Is he
clutch? Let's find out.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.307
Oh. Off the back of the rim.

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:50.309
One down, four to go.

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:51.177
Come on, Tyler.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.614
And it's off. It's, oh, it's looking good.

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:58.384
Oh, oh. O for two.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:11:59.452
- Hey, let's go. Clap me up.

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:00.286
Let's go, get high.

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:01.987
Come on, let's shut out.

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:03.155
- Three more remain.

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:07.426
- Off. Oh, whoa.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.263
It was in. It was literally,

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.132
it was like in the rim.

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:16.335
$200,000 on the line.

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:17.169
Shoot when you're ready.

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:19.338
- You're gonna make this.
Believe in yourself.

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:24.577
- For the boys. For the boys.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:25.411
Oh, what?

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.850
I do not envy the pressure
you're feeling now.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.218
I'm not even gonna say anything.

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:33.619
Let's let him do his thing.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:39.658
And it's in the air.

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:41.360
No. Oh. Oh my gosh.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.862
Yes. That's in.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.741
Oh, my gosh.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.513
That was the most hyped
thing I've ever seen.

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:01.914
Oh my gosh. That was clutch.

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:05.551
Like the sign says, it's $200,000.

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.453
Each of your grab four briefcases.

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:08.654
Throw it in your cars.

00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:09.622
Thank you for watching.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:10.389
Subscribe.
