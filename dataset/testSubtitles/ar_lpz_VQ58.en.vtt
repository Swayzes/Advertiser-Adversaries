00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
Why on earth would anyone buy a 55-inch TV for $20,000

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.200
when they can get one for 250 bucks?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.300
It doesn't even have features.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.200
No high refresh rate, no variable refresh rate.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.900
There's branding and buttons everywhere.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.400
And these bezels look straight out of my grandma's basement.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.500
It doesn't even have any goddamn HDMI ports or a remote control.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.500
But what it does have is features and capabilities

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.800
that are coveted by creators.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000
And not this kind, no offense.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.500
This kind.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.200
One does not simply see Lord of the Rings or Star Wars

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.900
until they've watched it on a display like this one

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.200
from Flanders Scientific,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.400
who happened to be in the neighborhood

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.400
and were nice enough to swing by with their latest and greatest

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.200
so we could take a gander.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.500
It boasts near-perfect color accuracy,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.600
tetrahedral interpolation, 12-bit 444 signaling,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.600
zero bullsh** image processing nonsense,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.600
meaning that for the first time in my life,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.700
I will finally see content the way the colorist saw it,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.700
the way the director saw it.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.300
What content, you might ask?

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.300
Well, to start with, we're gonna be checking out

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.700
the remastered segue Trilogy to our sponsor.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.700
Hetzner, if I know you,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.400
you're looking for a company with GDPR-compliant,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.000
high-performance cloud servers

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.400
that offer on-demand cloud computing platforms

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.500
and APIs on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.300
Classic you.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.800
Don't miss out and use code LTT24 at the link below

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.100
to get 20 euros off.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.500
The XMP550 Mastering Monitor

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.800
is likely the most accurate display

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.500
I have ever laid my two eyes on.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.900
It's QD OLED, so we've got incredible viewing angles

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.700
and color that pops.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.000
It's rated for 2000 nits peak brightness in a 4% window,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.200
and while 55 inches might seem small

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.900
by today's TV standards,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.100
it's actually big for what it is,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.300
with most of the predecessors to this product

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.200
being in the 30-inch range.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.200
Now, I'm gonna tell you a lot more about it

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.800
with some help from the Labs team,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.800
but first, I've gotta experience it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.200
Now, we didn't do a TV roundup for 2023,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.000
so for comparison, we've got two outstanding TVs from 2022,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.500
one with a first-generation QD OLED panel from Samsung

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.300
and the other with the competing WOLED panel from LG.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.700
Now, neither of these is gonna do 2000 nits,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.500
more like half of that,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.400
but they still might hold their own okay

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.300
because that often-boasted-about number,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.300
that's peak brightness in a tiny window.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.200
Once we get to bigger window sizes,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.100
the gap should narrow,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.800
and in filmmaker mode,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800
hey, theoretically, these displays

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.000
are super color accurate too,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.200
but maybe I just don't know what I'm missing.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.800
To find out, I've asked Brandon from the Lab to join me,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.600
and he's gonna be taking us on a little tour

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.600
of some content that might either tell us,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.200
well, this Flanders thing is amazing,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.900
or hey, don't bother, don't worry about it.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.900
Which will be awkward with the Flanders guys there,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.500
but what can I say?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Whoa, you guys are gonna notice

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.200
that the LG G2 looks wildly different

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.600
from the two QD OLED displays.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.900
That is due to the different spectral power distribution

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.100
on the G2 and the way that cameras capture TV output.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.800
Now, in some scenes, it's gonna be a subtle difference,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.200
but in others, this difference is going to stand out a lot,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.900
but I can assure you that in person,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.500
the G2 was relatively accurate to our human eyes.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.600
It was a lot more subtle.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.700
Also, please note, there are some really dark scenes here

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.000
that our cameras didn't capture very well,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.600
so for the best experience,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.200
you're going to want to watch in HDR.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.800
Man, the other displays almost look

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.700
like they have cheesecloth over them.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.000
Is that right, or did we screw something up?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.700
Their ABL's kicking in.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.800
That makes sense.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.700
Consumer displays have ABL, or auto brightness limiting,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.000
which is to protect them

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.100
so that they're not issuing warranty replacements

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.100
every six flippin' months.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.100
Also, because I guess they would have to comply

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.400
with energy standards that a professional display wouldn't.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.100
So they're just dimmer.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.600
For now. For now.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.400
It should be noted that for a brief period of time,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.500
ABL's not gonna be nearly as much of a factor.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.700
We just unplugged and replugged these TVs,

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.900
and you can see, now they're a lot closer,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.100
even if, you can tell already, shadow detail.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.200
I actually find the green saturation

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.300
is a little bit better than the W OLED.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.140
It's not much.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.200
Even the trees themselves are popping a bit more here.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.040
Yeah.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.900
They kind of blend into the background there on that one.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.200
But to get a better idea, we're gonna cut the lights,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.600
and we're gonna have a look at some test footage.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.100
We're gonna start off with this house scene here.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.300
Right away, look at the Samsung compared to your reference.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.900
It's not even close, dude.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.200
It's purple.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.040
Yeah.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.800
I know that what HDR is supposed to do

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.500
is it's supposed to make things look more true to life.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.900
But what blows me away

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.200
is that I feel like I'm looking at a dollhouse

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.900
with an actual light in an actual window

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.200
on the Flander Scientific.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.040
Yeah.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.500
I think it's just the consistency of the color.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.700
It just makes things look way more realistic.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.300
It's not white.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.700
It's light.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.800
Ah, this is gonna ruin everything for me.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.600
And look at the, oh my God, I didn't even notice.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.500
The Samsung doesn't have a fence.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.340
Nope.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.400
The burglars could get right into the backyard.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.100
You know, LG is doing a much better job

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.700
at retaining detail in the shadow compared to Samsung.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.500
I think the LG is still raising the blacks

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.440
a little bit though.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.200
Do you see where the garage is?

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.040
Mm-hmm.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.100
To the right of it, there's like some dark detail,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.000
but it's pretty dark.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.840
Yeah.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.960
If you look at the LG, it's raised a bit, right?

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.640
Like even the sky behind it.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.700
So they're retaining that detail in the shadow,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.700
but they're cheating a little.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.540
Yes.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.980
Where Samsung's going the opposite way,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.740
they're giving it like that punchier look,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.380
but you're losing, you're clipping all your black detail.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.300
No question.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.900
I would take the Flanders.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.220
Then I would take the LG actually.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.940
And then the Samsung for this.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.180
The Samsung is not handling skin tones

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.140
the way that I'd like.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.980
Yeah.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.180
I'll try to posit when it goes back to her face.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.020
Yeah.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.240
Particularly the Asian skin tone.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.080
Yeah.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.900
Samsung tends to oversaturate.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.740
Even in its filmmaker mode,

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.760
I've noticed that things look a bit rosier,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.080
more saturated on people.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.920
Even the dirt.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.740
Like look at the dirt compared to-

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.580
It's orange.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.400
Yeah.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.320
Dirt's not orange.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.520
LG doesn't look too bad.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.360
No, no.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.560
To their credit, it's more accurate,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.960
even if the capability is not quite as good.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.800
Yeah.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.620
Like look at his hair.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.460
He's red.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.300
Yeah, and his skin.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.120
He's red.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.800
And back to what we said about realism, right?

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.400
True to life, what color is a late night street lamp?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.240
Yellow.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.060
It's yellow.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.900
It's not orange.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.120
That's what it's supposed to look like.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.700
And that seat is a blue leather.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.300
Not whatever that color is.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.300
It's got pink in it.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.140
Yeah.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.460
I can't believe how bad this Samsung looks.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.060
This is the TV I have at home and I'm shocked.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.900
Well, right?

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.700
And guys, you gotta remember,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.140
Brandon test displays for a living.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.940
Like how long have you been doing it now?

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.980
Four, over four years.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.940
Yeah.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.140
And that's how easily, like even we're bamboozled.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.460
There's no way that that was the director's intent.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.540
Looking at this, we're supposed to be able to see

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.200
everything that's going on.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.540
Here, look at that.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.860
She's wearing a purple shirt.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.900
She's wearing a black shirt with purple,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.700
I don't know, something along here.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.580
This doesn't look too bad.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.020
No, none of this bothers me.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.860
And that reminds me,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.700
part of why I had a hard time differentiating there

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.140
was because I was kind of busy looking at the content.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.660
And no matter which of these TVs you have,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.620
that's what you're gonna be doing most of the time.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.980
So these are still hair splitting differences

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.140
that we're picking at.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.620
It's just fun if you're a giant nerd.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.620
These strawberries look really good.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.460
They look super red.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.640
I could eat those.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.600
Yes.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.280
They look pretty washed out on the LG.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.120
Yup.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.120
They look okay on the Samsung, but it's still not as red.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.560
It's not, no, it's not as accurate.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.360
Oh, and look at the shadow detail on the reflection.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.120
It's like all gone on the Samsung.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.620
Oh yeah.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.000
So on the LG, but you're desaturated.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.920
But it's, yeah, it looks like a ghost

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.680
of what a strawberry is supposed to look like

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.480
in the reflection, the top looks all right.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.040
But those don't look as delicious.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.400
Those are more sour.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.100
And those are super sweet.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.100
As long as it's not a super saturated color,

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.140
the LG does okay.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.380
And I believe the Mario movie,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.320
the mastering display primaries are P3,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.280
which all these displays should be able to do.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.460
Now my understanding is the Mario movie

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.260
was mastered for a peak of 800 nits.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.100
Is that correct?

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.220
According to the metadata.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.820
So theoretically, any one of these displays

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.980
can reach the brightness that we need to see.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.820
Even the Samsung, it's oversaturating

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.500
Bowser's eyes a little bit.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.360
They're a bit too orange.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.200
It looks nice.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.600
Like my eyes like that,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.640
but that's what it should look like.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.800
So LG, pretty close.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.680
Honestly, the LG is very color accurate.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.960
I'm really glad we're looking at real content now though,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.520
because looking at test patterns or the ASC footage

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.520
made the difference seem a lot differenter.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.280
Looking at a real movie,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.620
which is going to be mastered with home displays in mind

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.240
a little bit more, I guess.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.520
I don't find the difference nearly as noticeable.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.360
Can you pause it right here?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.020
I can.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.660
What a great still.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.100
Mario's hat does look a bit oversaturated

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.380
or a bit like maybe pink or purplish compared to here.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.820
The true version looks almost right in between

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.320
the almost too orangey Samsung

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.940
and the almost too, I don't know, blue purple.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.180
Yeah, blue purplish.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.700
That's going on on the LG.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.880
I think especially with animated content,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.860
you have less like memory colors to reference, right?

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.740
Like you don't have realistic skin tones

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.940
and all those kinds of things.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.520
So I think it's just a lot easier to be fooled

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.760
in thinking this looks correct.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760
That's true.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.200
And like back to that night scene where I was like,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.640
oh yeah, no, I know what an ugly yellow street lamp

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.680
is supposed to look like.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.400
Well, this rainbow burning fire could be anything.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.520
He looks almost pallid and dead on the Flanders.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.360
Which-

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.180
He's rosy on the Samsung.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.680
Was clearly the intent.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.320
They're not supposed to look life full.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.020
Brown uniform, green uniform.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.100
This is probably the starkest difference I've seen

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.460
between the right color and completely the wrong color.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.620
That looks like it could have been made out of leather.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.260
Also, you can tell that this is daylight lit

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.540
because on the Flanders,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.460
there's a bit of a bluey cast to everything.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.620
Whereas we're losing that with the oversaturation

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.960
of the greens on the other displays.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.100
Here's what I want to know.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.720
Maybe this is my first question for the Flanders folks.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.320
Is the problem that it's more work

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.600
to just not do any bull processing?

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.080
Yeah. Fundamentally, I always tell people

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.840
it's more about what we don't do almost

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.880
rather than what we do.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.640
Is that really hard to not do that?

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.120
The problem is most of the chips that I use

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.520
are off the shelf chips from companies like MediaTek.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.560
So we don't do that.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.200
We do everything on FPGAs instead.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.360
That's why they cost so much.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.280
So it's a cost savings thing.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.640
Slash an unwillingness to build your own processor

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.000
from the ground up to not do any of this BS.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.500
It's another dark scene with oranges.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.340
Oh my gosh.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.360
The Samsung is doing so bad.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.200
Yeah.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.400
And not that Brandon has a horse in this race or anything,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.020
but that's his TV.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.960
Incredible.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.560
Okay.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.400
Dang it.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.580
I mean, even here, that's an orange fire.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.420
Those are red fires.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.980
Yeah.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.700
Oh, that looks so very metallic.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.060
According to HGTV test,

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.620
the scene coming up should be 2000 nits

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.820
coming off of Gandalf.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.420
So the maximum capability of our Flanders

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.780
and well beyond the maximum capabilities

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.260
of our consumer TVs here.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Yes.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.460
Although it is a bright scene, very high APL.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.860
Not sure how much that's going to come into play here.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.000
Ooh.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.920
Pause it.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.680
Everyone's handling this pretty well.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.800
There's clipping going on the Samsung though.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.560
I don't know if it's because of the color stuff,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.320
but you can't make out nearly as much.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.080
Losing the trees in the, whatever,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.120
the light source that's behind Gandalf.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.400
LG pretty good.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.360
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.640
You can barely make out the form of his body

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.040
through the robes on the Samsung.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.460
And it's also just not as bright.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.560
I think the Samsung is tone mapping a lot here.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.880
I'm also losing the folds in Legolas' cloak.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.760
Yeah, so these two are about the same.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.440
They're both hitting around 1000 nits

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.160
off of this little beam.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.200
The Samsung is down to about 700.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.640
And I guess that's probably because of tone mapping.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.020
One thing we didn't focus on last time around

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.120
is an undesirable behavior of the Flanders

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.560
if you were using it for consuming content.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.540
And that is that if there is a signal

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.380
that is outside of its maximum brightness range,

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.300
rather than just tone mapping it down

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.820
and trying to smooth out the transition,

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.020
it'll just peak, which is to say

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.460
it will completely lose any detail

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.380
that was supposed to be there.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.860
And you can really see it on the bird's left cheek

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.740
here on the right side of the frame here.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.780
There's nothing left of the feather detail there.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.580
Whereas, actually the LG doesn't do a very good job.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.420
It's not doing great.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.000
Samsung, though, retains some of the texture

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.520
that's supposed to be there.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.720
Oh yeah, LG actually manages to peak

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.280
even worse than Flanders.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.400
Yeah, LG does have dynamic tone mapping on right now,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.460
but that is the default behavior in filmmaker mode.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.200
Yeah, and it's just not working very well.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.040
Huh.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.880
Oh yeah, wow.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.040
This one's really interesting.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.200
Hey look, there's green there.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.200
Yeah, first off, the colors are completely different.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.040
Yeah.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.920
But here, this is a great quantization

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.520
banding test pattern.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.560
So just look at the Samsung.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.160
You can clearly see that white circle

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.740
ends right there.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.580
Yeah, and then another circle.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.140
Yeah, and then look at the LG.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.060
The LG is much worse.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.340
You can really see, it's like looking at the rings

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.100
of Saturn around the outer perimeter.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.220
Whereas the Flanders, I guess that's what a 5D LUT

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.820
or whatever the crap it is that they're using

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.940
is gonna do for you.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.220
How do you guys describe the LUT?

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.140
A tetrahedral LUT interpolation.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.780
It looks so smooth here.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.620
It's falling apart.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.700
It looks so yucky on the rest of them.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.520
This is not a bit rate issue.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.400
This is the ability of the processor to interpret

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.840
all the different little micro steps of color

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.760
that might exist.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.700
And you can see the consumer displays

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.000
are falling flat on their faces.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.840
There's more to this thing

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.140
than just a pretty face though.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.560
Build quality is solid with an aluminum chassis

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.000
and a graphite heat sink.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.020
And it operates fanless in spite of the fact

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.740
that 2000 nits, even in a small area,

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.000
can generate some serious heat.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.860
And this is cool.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.680
Check this out.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.160
Part of why this display is so expensive

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.840
is because it can offer up information

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.560
that might not be relevant to you,

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.800
but is relevant to filmmakers,

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.600
like showing false color

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.200
or a live readout of luminance and waveforms

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.080
so you can make sure that what you're looking at

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.520
is as you intended.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.400
And that's the reason why you or I, budget aside,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.020
might not actually want to use this as a home display.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.040
Also the lack of HDMI, et cetera, et cetera.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.040
The XMP 550 is a tool for professionals

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.440
and it offers no post-processing whatsoever.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.680
That includes, or rather doesn't include, tone mapping.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.960
This TV, or more accurately, display,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.480
shows the footage in its unprocessed form

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.640
with only a custom 3D LUT or a lookup table

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.540
to make sure the colors are displayed accurately.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.920
And because of that, when we show content

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.440
that was mastered at a higher brightness value

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.720
rather than roll off pleasingly and retain detail,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.440
it'll simply clip.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.520
That's intended because a colorist

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.600
doesn't want to be fooled into thinking,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.680
this is what a 4,000-nit scene looks like.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.400
So it's kind of a safety mechanism

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.600
to ensure that they know,

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.160
hey, you've gone beyond the capabilities of this display

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.140
and you can do that,

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.680
but you're kind of grading blind at this point.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.920
But wait, hold on a second.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.700
Grading blind, isn't this thing the be-all and end-all?

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.200
All right, we're working on a tech quickie

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.800
that's gonna help further explain color spaces

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.560
and terms like chromaticity in the not too distant future.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.680
But when it comes to HDR and Rec. 2020,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.480
that's a volumetric color space

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.040
that can go all the way to 10,000 nits

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.040
beyond the capabilities of even this display.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.440
I mean, QD OLED has gotten us close

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.320
in terms of color saturation,

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.320
but the brightness just isn't there yet.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.520
Now, the primary competitor to the XMP550

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.840
is Sony's new BVM-HX3110,

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.760
a dual-layer LCD mastering monitor

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.240
that uses a technology similar to the Hisense U9DG

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.440
that we covered almost two years ago.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.520
It can reach a whopping 4,000 nits,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.440
but the color saturation is narrower.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.260
To hit 100% of the entire volume,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.040
you'd need basically pure color wavelengths

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.320
like frickin' lasers displaying your image,

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.940
and that's gonna be a while.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.640
Also, despite the Sony unit offering extra brightness,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.640
there are a few reasons why you might prefer

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.220
the Flanders Scientific Display.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.860
First and foremost, they're really nice people

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.860
who are entirely non-threatening.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.620
No, I'm kidding, but seriously,

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.320
the near-perfect viewing angles,

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.420
thanks to the Quantum Dot OLED panel,

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.700
mean that you can use a single display for both working

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.340
and showing references to your client or boss,

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.500
someone who's likely to be a big deal,

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.940
like a studio head or a creative director.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.700
To illustrate why this matters,

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.260
we had an older dual-layer LCD mastering display at LTX,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.900
and Brandon was constantly instructing people

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.940
to, no, no, you have to stand directly in front of it,

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.340
or it really doesn't look right.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.860
Second, OLED's lightning-fast self-emissive pixels

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.100
give us zero rise or fall time motion blur,

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.580
not to mention inky blacks without any halation or blooming.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.140
Right, and also the price.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.220
Yeah, I know, right?

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.700
At only $20,000, it's really well-positioned

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.740
for a brand new mastering monitor.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.780
Our quote for the BVM-HX3110 was almost $30,000,

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.380
and it's under a third of the size.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.580
Of course, though, your choice might be dictated

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.380
by creative requirements rather than budgets.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.420
If your film contains scenes like this, for example,

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.780
the ABL, or Auto Brightness Limiter,

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.660
that protects our QD OLED panel might preclude its use,

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.980
even if it doesn't operate as aggressively

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.740
as a consumer display.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.140
However, if I was working on something like the Mario movie,

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.780
I'd be a fool to go dual-layer LCD at any price,

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.540
just like I'd be a fool if I didn't sign up

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.580
for a notification for our new precision screwdriver.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.300
The Flanders is also, finally, a viable alternative

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.140
to the venerable BVM-X300, which is still sought after today

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.100
despite being discontinued.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.220
That one used a true RGB-stripe OLED panel,

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.620
which avoids washing out color with a white sub-pixel,

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.740
but being older, it could only reach 1,000 nits

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.620
in a 10% window.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.020
They're also not getting any younger,

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.420
so burn-in is becoming a concern with these displays.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.940
There are other options that are still in production

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.420
with the BVM-E251 and 171, but those are 1080p

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.220
at 24 1⁄2 and 16 1⁄2 inches, respectively.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.700
If anyone watching this video actually needs

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.060
any of this stuff, hey, we'll have links

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.300
in the description below.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.260
For now, I wanna throw over to Brandon from the lab

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.540
to talk about our measured results

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.420
from the Flanders scientific model.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.980
Due to our limited time with the XMP550,

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.300
we were only able to test its color accuracy

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.740
with HDR signals.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.740
For our testing, we used the Delta E ITP metric

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.380
for our color error evaluation,

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.820
since it's designed for high luminance values

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.420
and a wide color gamut, two integral parts of HDR.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.620
As we saw earlier, the S95B is skewing a bit red,

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.840
and on top of that, it oversaturates,

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.020
but it's still reasonably accurate, as is the G2.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.180
However, the XMP550 is a clear winner,

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.420
hitting a Delta E ITP average of less than two

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.500
and a max of less than five.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.900
This is by far the best color accuracy I've ever measured.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.740
What's even more impressive is the lack of any major change

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.860
when adding luminance error to the equation.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.960
See how the values are nearly identical?

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.920
The same can't be said for our other sets,

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.260
especially the G2.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.060
That's because the XMP outputs light and color

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.400
basically perfectly to give us accurate HDR content.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.300
Its PQ EOTF curve is tracking nearly identically

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.660
to the HDR standard.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:35.060
Meanwhile, the G2 and S95B both have minor inaccuracies,

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.340
as well as a worse white balance by comparison.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.820
And even with the XMP550 capped out at 1800 nits

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.340
with a D65 white,

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.980
it still handily beats our two other TVs.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.820
Overall, a very impressive piece of technology

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.060
for the people who need it,

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.460
even if it does also kind of highlight

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.460
that there's still room for these displays to improve.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.740
There's no such thing as a perfect solution right now.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.740
Now you might've noticed,

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.380
we've been toying with HDR recently

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.460
and you're probably wondering,

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.880
hey, Linus, I'm watching this video in HDR right now.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.380
Do you guys need one of those?

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.860
And depending who you ask,

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.860
production team's not here, that's good.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.820
I don't think we need one.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.340
No, I don't think we need one.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.300
At least not until the check clears from our sponsor.

that are also using Samsung QD OLED technology.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.780
They look incredible.
