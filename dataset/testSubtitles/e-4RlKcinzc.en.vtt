00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.335
Before you grab your pitchforks,

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:05.238
I am going to keep the Fairphone 5 around.

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.107
I am a big believer in their mission

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:09.542
to build more repairable, more sustainable,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.678
and more ethically sourced phones.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:15.582
And with software updates planned all the way through 2031,

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:18.385
there is plenty of time for improvements,

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.421
which is good because of things like this.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.423
What is this?

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.426
To be fair to Fairphone, according to a January email,

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.428
the two handsets that were delivered to us

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:32.499
on August 31st, 2023 are final prototypes

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.868
and not part of the retail production run

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.437
that started shipping to customers two weeks later.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:40.440
Fairphone revealed that in the ramp up to full production,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.709
they turned up some cases of bad soldering,

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.911
mic failures, and antenna issues

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.480
that were solved for the mass production run.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.382
So the units we evaluated

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.718
aren't technically mass production units,

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.621
but none of the changes that Fairphone disclosed

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.257
were likely to impact our experience with the device.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:00.326
Anyway, with that grain of salt out of the way,

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.663
let's just rip the bandaid off

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.198
and tell you about our sponsor.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.901
Mellatrix, their all new Boog 75

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:11.337
is a fully assembled, ultra customizable aluminum keyboard

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:14.307
with pre-lubed magnetic switches and stabilizers

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:16.476
so you can boogie all night long.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.012
And by boogie, I mean, use your cool keyboard.

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.713
Just listen to how good it sounds.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.517
Right out of the box,

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:26.352
I was immediately enamored

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.221
with the optional transparent back.

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.956
It looks so cool.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.759
It's plastic, so you don't have to worry about it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.728
shattering and it effortlessly pops off

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.498
so you can get to the battery and the rest of the guts.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.201
It's like a little trip back in time,

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.802
but in a really good way.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.637
Migration to the Fairphone was painless

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.973
and I love the fingerprint sensor

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:48.842
being built into the power button on the side.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:51.478
Okay, that's the old fashioned way of doing things,

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:55.081
but it is so much faster than an underscreen sensor,

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.417
especially the one I was using on the LG Wing.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.918
Speaking of old fashioned though,

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.487
there is a lot going on here

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:05.492
that's less quaint and more, what year is it?

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.595
For instance, peering through the transparent back,

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.531
I found no obvious signs of wireless charging.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:14.701
And while it's not the kind of thing that I use that often,

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.736
it still feels like a bit of a bummer.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.771
And I feel the same way about the placement

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.341
of the nano SIM and micro SD slots.

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.409
They are under the battery.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.711
I mean, don't get me wrong.

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:26.446
I'm grateful they're included at all.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.615
And the battery is not glued in,

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.884
making it super easy to remove.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:34.354
But why do I need to power down my phone

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.222
in order to pop in an SD card?

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:40.160
Flipping things over, the display is fine, I guess.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.962
I noticed a yellow tint to it when it's off axis,

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.031
more than I'm used to seeing on a modern OLED.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.433
And just like the Fairphone 4,

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.470
the bezels are as large as they are non-uniform

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.438
with the top and bottom having at least

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:56.042
an extra C of thickness compared to the sides.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:59.179
Though, that is nothing compared to the profile

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.480
of you with this bad boy.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.382
Damn, boy!

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.417
Damn, boy!

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:07.587
It's about on par with my wife's S23 Ultra.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:11.558
And that's with a dbrand protective case installed on it.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.693
And it comes with a weight to match.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:17.997
212 grams, or about seven and a half freedom ounces.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.632
At least we accounted for that

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:22.101
when we designed our new LTT lounge pants.

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:25.305
So comfy and available now at lttstore.com.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.307
You know what else feels like time travel?

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:30.443
I can't remember the last time I did a phone review

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.879
and I felt like I needed to have a performance

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.814
and responsiveness section.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.383
I mean, maybe I've been spoiled by more premium devices,

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.986
but the Fairphone 5 really did feel more

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:43.389
like my ancient Note 9 than a modern phone.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.859
We conducted our labs testing alongside both a Pixel 8,

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.895
which was chosen for its comparable price

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.731
and a Galaxy Note 5 that had a new battery

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.866
and a fresh install of Lineage OS

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:56.402
in order to put the performance of the Fairphone

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.771
in the appropriate context.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:02.275
And that is exactly as flattering as it sounds.

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.544
We're gonna have all three phones linked down below.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:07.814
Honestly, I think our biggest surprise was the Note 5.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.315
Not in every way, mind you.

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:11.317
Its gaming performance wasn't amazing.

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:13.419
It's eight years old and doesn't even support

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.588
all the latest and greatest graphics extensions.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.658
But for general phone, chat, browser use,

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.460
it's pretty darn responsive.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.395
About on par with the Fairphone 5

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.663
to the untrained observer,

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:26.899
at least if you don't turn the 90 Hertz display on

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.134
on the Fairphone 5.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:30.670
Though there are some reasons that we wouldn't do that

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.071
and we'll talk about those later.

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:35.341
Now, of course, the Fairphone did beat out the Note

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.510
in more of our controlled tests,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.513
but not by as much as you'd expect.

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:42.682
And against contemporary competition,

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:46.586
the Fairphone fares even worse.

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:48.821
Not only did the Pixel 8 outperform it

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.857
in all but one of our tests,

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:53.593
the one test where it didn't lose

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:55.862
was the time to fully charge the battery.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.597
And even then it was a tie.

00:04:57.597 --> 00:05:02.001
Also, once charged, the Pixel lasted twice as long

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:04.170
before it was fully discharged.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.440
Ah, that's why 90 Hertz is off by default.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.642
This probably comes down to Fairphone's

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.944
unorthodox choice of SoC.

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:15.315
They went with the Qualcomm QCM6490,

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.251
which TLDR, is not a phone chip.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:21.154
Rather, it's optimized for long-term industrial

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.623
and commercial IoT applications.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:24.891
It's a cool chip.

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:27.627
It supports an impressive list of wireless technologies,

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:31.297
including Wi-Fi 6E with 8x8 multi-user MIMO,

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:34.133
which is absolutely unheard of in a phone.

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:37.070
And crucially, it will enjoy long-term support

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.372
from Qualcomm, enabling Fairphone to continue

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.375
to provide updates to this thing for years to come.

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.944
Unfortunately, it's Cryo 670 cores

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:46.713
are based on older ARM designs

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:49.482
that just can't compete with modern chips.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:50.783
Though to be honest with you,

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:54.120
the raw performance was far from my only issue

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.054
with this thing.

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:58.191
Remember that fingerprint sensor that I started out loving?

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.494
Both it and the volume buttons are not actually proud enough

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:02.829
to be easily found by touch,

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:04.831
and I was constantly pressing one

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:06.399
when I meant to press the other.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.835
The vibration is inexcusably weak

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:10.136
compared to our challengers,

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:11.838
making it easy to miss a phone call

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.039
when it's sitting in my pocket,

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.108
and compounding this issue,

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:18.144
while the maximum ringer volume of 87 decibels

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:21.013
is right on par with the comparison phones,

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:26.018
the Fairphone 5's minimum ringer volume is 71 decibels.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.890
That is about 15 decibels higher than the competition,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.294
which is perceived as almost three times as loud.

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:40.299
That is really, really loud.

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:44.937
So my options were to either miss my calls

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:46.639
by having it on vibrate,

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.242
or annoy the heck out of everyone around me.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:52.178
Now admittedly, I can be a bit of a special case,

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:53.546
at least that's what my mom says,

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:57.150
but guys, I can't be the only one who needs to know

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.818
when someone is trying to get ahold of me,

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:01.854
and this alone was enough to be a deal breaker.

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:03.389
While we're talking about special me,

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.159
I've been daily driving Samsung phones for a long time,

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.094
and I have developed a bit of a preference

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:09.896
for how Samsung does things,

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.731
which led to my next deal breaker.

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:15.034
On the Fairphone, I cannot move the back button

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.536
over to the right side.

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:18.471
I'm sorry, but without that,

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:21.841
this lands squarely in the neat phones

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:24.143
that will never be my daily driver pile.

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:25.378
Making matters worse,

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:28.648
I can't even move the stock Google widget up and down

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:30.917
without using a custom launcher.

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:31.818
Really?

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:35.121
And guys, I am just getting started on the skin.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.191
A long press doesn't present an uninstall option for an app,

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.392
just app info.

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:41.294
I missed call screening on this thing.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.695
A lot.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.730
Screenshot editing and sharing sucks,

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.667
and Plex would just stop responding entirely,

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.135
very regularly.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.636
Though admittedly, that could be Plex

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:52.472
just being a steaming pile of garbage.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.674
And, this is just a pet peeve of mine,

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:57.577
I couldn't find any way to have it automatically proceed

00:07:57.577 --> 00:07:59.078
when the correct pin is entered.

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:01.781
I get it, pressing okay is a security feature,

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:03.783
but I don't like the extra keystrokes.

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:06.719
On top of all that, I experienced a significant amount

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:09.055
of just downright buggy behavior,

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.791
with the worst being audio problems.

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:14.293
I think what was happening was that,

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:16.662
even though the Fairphone lost its headphone jack

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:18.097
in the great Bluetooth war,

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:22.134
it would sometimes experience phantom headphone jack syndrome,

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:24.871
making it so that both the speaker

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:27.240
and the earpiece would stay silent.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.140
It's really bizarre.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.110
Like on a phone call, I could get it to work in speaker,

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.179
and then if I was watching a YouTube video,

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.780
I would get no audio at all.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.917
So the hardware's working.

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:39.719
Fairphone told us this was an issue

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:41.487
that they saw in early devices,

00:08:41.487 --> 00:08:43.422
but then every time I experienced it,

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.757
a reboot would clear it up,

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:47.560
which indicates to me that it's a software issue.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.861
Let us know in the comments, by the way,

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:51.797
if you've run into this with your Fairphone 5.

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:53.232
Let's see, what else?

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:55.801
Oh, the screen brightness bounced around

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.570
like my kids at a birthday party.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.639
From our testing, it looks like Fairphone

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:03.042
doesn't do anything to smooth out the sensor data

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.611
or the transitions between their brightness levels,

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.314
and they also use a fairly small variable

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:10.049
to store the ambient brightness reading

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.717
compared to other phones.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:14.520
The result is very distracting,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.155
especially when you're watching content

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:17.657
in a dimly lit room

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.326
where the light from the phone's own screen

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:22.995
bouncing around the room and hitting the sensor

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.298
will cause it to constantly change

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:28.067
as it switches from one scene to the next.

00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:31.370
Camera, didn't use it a ton,

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.973
but when I did, the results were oversaturated,

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:36.676
over-sharpened, and generally over-processed.

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:37.710
I mean, don't get me wrong,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.779
it's a lot better than my ancient Note9

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:41.948
as far as rear camera quality goes,

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:44.216
but if you put it up against anything modern

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:46.519
like the Pixel or an S23 Ultra,

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.521
there's just no comparison.

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:50.556
I also found that the dynamic range

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.892
and auto-exposure of the selfie camera,

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:55.461
especially for shooting videos, was not amazing.

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.897
It's just, it's the kind of thing that tier ones

00:09:57.897 --> 00:09:59.699
spend a lot of time and money on,

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:02.969
and I feel like we just kind of take for granted

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.570
until we don't have it.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.739
To be clear, there were positives too.

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:09.875
The running apps notification in the shade, kind of nice.

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.414
Okay, I kid, there are more of them.

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:18.317
The repairability, legitimately really cool,

00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:20.820
and they've obviously put considerable effort

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.322
into making things as straightforward as possible

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:25.057
if you need to replace a part.

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:26.525
But if I'm being honest,

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:28.961
I feel like they've almost overshot the mark

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:31.364
and they've made some unnecessary compromises.

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:34.166
Compared to our humble Note 5, for example,

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:37.269
other than the initial hassle of removing the back,

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:40.773
it's not actually that much harder to work on.

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.875
I mean, you need to give it a bit of a drink

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:46.045
of isopropyl alcohol to release the adhesive on the battery,

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:48.848
but after that, it's a pretty easy swap.

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:50.583
You got the same ribbon cables,

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:53.552
the same tiny screws, tiny plugs.

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:55.021
They're all the same size,

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.289
but Samsung did it without turning their phone

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:59.925
into a freaking weapon.

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:02.128
For that, you had to wait for the Note 7.

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:05.331
Ayo, ancient Zing, Samsung.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.100
It kind of seems to me that by going the extra mile

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.369
and turning everything into modules,

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:12.838
Fairphone has solved some problems,

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.674
but they've also created some new ones,

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.810
leaving them with a device that is, in their own words,

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.047
a fair phone, not a great phone.

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:23.616
And unless you desperately wanna support their mission

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:26.118
or your needs are extremely basic

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:28.421
and you just like spending more money,

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:31.323
I don't know how to craft a recommendation for this thing.

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:34.193
I mean, maybe if they turned the SoC RAM and storage

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:35.461
into a module as well,

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:39.198
so you could swap that out and upgrade it.

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:42.568
Even then, a part of me would feel so much better

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:45.638
just steering you toward rescuing an old Note 5

00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:46.472
from the shelter,

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:49.775
rather than adopting a brand new one of these

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:52.178
and steering you toward our sponsor.

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:54.880
Manscaped, when the overgrowth is starting

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.615
down in your undergarden,

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:59.919
cut it away with Manscaped's Lawnmower 5.0.

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:02.722
Its trimmer blade and foil blade are interchangeable,

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:06.759
letting you choose between basic buzz cut or pitbull smooth.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.561
Not the dog breed, the guy who shouts,

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.695
Dale!

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:12.832
The Lawnmower 5.0 even comes with an LED light

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:15.768
to navigate through those more voluminous spots

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:18.404
as you conduct your hunt for the red October.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:21.340
It also charges conveniently with a USB-C cable.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.808
Couple that with its portability

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:25.377
and you can whack the weeds anywhere you might be,

00:12:25.377 --> 00:12:27.379
though please check any local statutes

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:29.315
on public weed whacking beforehand.

00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:33.152

If you guys enjoyed this video,

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:41.060
the Fairphone 5 isn't available in North America yet,

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.862
so hey, why not check out our review

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:44.930
of the last gen Fairphone 4.
