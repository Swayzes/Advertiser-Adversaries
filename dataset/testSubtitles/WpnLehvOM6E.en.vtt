00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.501
You did it!

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:06.940
You finally built or bought a brand new gaming PC,

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.742
except there's one small problem.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:12.612
Right now, it's the most expensive paperweight you own.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:16.116
How do you make the computer compute?

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.351
Well, doing it right takes more than just

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.553
plugging her in and letting her rip.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:23.490
Like, ooh, what's this button doing?

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.091
What the heck am I looking at here?

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.560
How do I get past this?

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.396
Well, for starters, you're gonna have to get past

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.431
today's sponsor, Thorum.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.799
It's Valentine's Day.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.501
Do you know where your gift is?

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.002
Get yourself or your loved one a unique

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.771
and stunning ring this Valentine's Day

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.806
and make it extra precious for your precious.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.007
Just go to the link down below

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.710
and use code LTT to get 20% off.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.045
Our goal in making this video

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.047
was to be as comprehensive as possible.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.282
So while we would recommend watching it

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.084
all the way through the first time,

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.819
we've added convenient chapter markers

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.022
if you ever wanna come back for a topic-specific refresher.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.857
We'll begin with the physical things

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:58.725
that you need to set up,

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.027
starting with location.

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:04.364
Now, obviously, easy access to your ports is critical.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.765
So depending on your case,

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:09.135
you might prefer it on the right or on the left.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.539
But what's less obvious is that your PC's position

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.176
can have a big impact on future maintenance requirements.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.611
The main way that dust enters your case

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.413
is by being sucked into the front

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.315
or the bottom intake fans.

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:24.617
Keeping those off the floor means that your system

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.253
will require far less frequent cleaning.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:29.622
This is especially true for carpeted flooring,

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.991
which not only acts as a pet hair magnet,

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:35.295
but can also starve your power supply of fresh air

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.664
depending on its orientation.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:40.100
If you must have your system on the floor, though,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.935
at least do yourself a favor

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.370
and put it under the edge of your desk.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.573
Even with top exhaust fans,

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:50.243
a shocking amount of dust can settle down into your system

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.245
if you have an open-top grill.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:53.613
If your system has an antenna,

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:54.914
it should be in line of sight

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.416
with any Bluetooth peripherals

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.084
that you intend to connect later,

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.652
and it should be clear of anything

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:02.655
that might block the signal to your Wi-Fi access point,

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:06.092
like a dense concrete wall or granite countertop,

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.461
or even the PC's chassis itself.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.796
I mean, you know what they say.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:13.366
Distance makes the RF signal stronger.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.400
Now you're ready to plug in,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.536
and the first cable is gonna be power.

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.438
This ensures that your equipment is grounded

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.473
and protected from electrostatic discharge.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.342
As for the other end of the cable,

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.010
well, good PC power supplies

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.379
can handle a wide range of power conditions

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.848
before supplying anything to the rest of your PC,

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:31.918
but plugging into the wall or into a dumb power strip

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.254
can stress it if your wall power is noisy

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:36.256
or prone to voltage sagging and brownouts.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:37.590
This is especially true

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.359
when other high-power appliances are running,

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.060
like, say, an air conditioner.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.896
A UPS or premium surge protector

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.731
can help clean that power up a bit

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.599
before it hits your PC or display,

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.433
but failing that,

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.769
I'd recommend at least a basic surge protector,

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.505
which can help protect your computer against voltage spikes

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.174
from things like a lightning strike.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.608
For desktop peripherals,

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.610
I'd recommend plugging your keyboard and your mouse

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.846
into the slowest USB ports

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:03.216
that are connected directly to your motherboard's chipset.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.918
They're not gonna use the extra performance

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.452
of a faster port anyway,

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:09.155
and plugging them into secondary controllers

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:10.690
or into add-in cards

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.759
can sometimes cause them to stay inactive

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.694
until the system is finished booting

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.963
or experience delays and hitches.

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:19.199
You can check the block diagram for your motherboard

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.335
if you're unsure which ports are connected to what.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:23.436
The same is true, by the way,

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:25.171
if you're using a USB headset

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.040
or a desktop DAC and amp.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.808
Pretty much every time I've seen someone

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:30.143
report issues with these things,

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.612
it's because they're connected through a hub or something.

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:35.114
Do yourself a favor, connect directly.

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:38.151
Now, if your audio device uses an old-school headphone jack,

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.320
you can either use the front panel once,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.521
if your case has them,

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:43.423
or you can use the ports on the rear.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.858
They'll usually be color-coded green and red

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.727
for the headphones and mic respectively,

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.562
or else they'll have symbols next to them.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.165
Some modern motherboards will actually prompt you

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.099
for what you've plugged in,

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.535
and they'll work regardless of where you plug things in,

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.971
but they may not work optimally.

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.740
On that subject, some cases and laptops

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.010
might not have two separate three-pole jacks,

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.713
but rather have a single four-pole jack.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.948
In that case, you're gonna need to get a Y cable

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:12.385
like this one, unless your headset includes one in the box.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.220
Next up is display.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.757
Most gaming PCs come with a dedicated GPU installed

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.626
in a PCI Express slot,

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:23.429
and you should always plug your main display into that,

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.399
rather than the ports on your motherboard's IO panel.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:29.869
Those ones are routed to your onboard graphics instead.

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:32.772
Now, with the right UEFI BIOS configuration,

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.107
we'll touch on that in a moment,

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:37.210
your system may support connecting extra monitors

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.178
to both of them at the same time,

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:42.148
but if you run your game off of the wrong ports,

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:45.752
it will have a negative impact on your gaming experience.

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.453
As for which cable to use,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.523
HDMI, DisplayPort, or USB-C,

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:52.759
that boils down to what your monitor supports

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.194
and what your graphics card supports.

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:57.497
When in doubt, DisplayPort is usually

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:00.500
the more correct choice for PC,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.502
thanks to its generally higher bandwidth

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:04.504
and broader support for extras

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.939
like variable refresh rate gaming,

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:10.276
but you should also refer to your GPU and display manuals

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:13.212
to see exactly which features are supported.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.381
One last thing, if you're using a desktop

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.216
with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth,

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:18.818
and you intend to use it,

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.321
please make sure you screw in your antennas.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.656
Unlike laptops, desktops often

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.658
don't have integrated antennas,

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:28.695
and while you might be able to see nearby networks,

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:30.096
you will almost certainly struggle

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:31.664
to stay connected to them.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:34.400
It usually doesn't matter which one screws into where.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.302
If you've got wired ethernet instead,

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:38.538
then you'll often have one place to plug it in

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:39.906
and you're good to go,

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:41.174
but if you have to,

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.309
it's probably worth checking your motherboard's manual

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.977
to find out what's what.

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:46.979
Sometimes they're the exact same thing

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:48.681
and completely interchangeable,

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:51.784
but other times, one will use a slower,

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:54.320
but maybe more broadly supported controller,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.723
while the other might use a multi-gig controller

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:59.392
that's faster, but requires additional drivers

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:01.160
once you're booted into Windows.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.497
These multi-gig ports can be a huge boon to creatives

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:05.932
and to storage enthusiasts

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:08.334
who have network-attached storage devices,

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:09.936
or actually even gamers

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:12.171
who have balling out internet plans,

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.674
but if they're plugged into a typical network

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:16.909
that has gigabit ports everywhere else,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.946
they're gonna be limited to gigabit speeds anyway.

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:21.681
With everything plugged in and in place,

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.616
now's a good time to tidy up your cables.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:25.418
You can use zip ties in a pinch,

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:26.719
but hook and loop cable ties

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.855
are a better solution for future maintenance.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.256
Lttstore.com.

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:32.191
Also, we have something even better coming soon.

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.993
Sign up for an in-stock notification

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:37.029
for our cable management arches at the link below.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.864
Now that that's done,

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:39.866
it's finally time to fire it up.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:42.235
Flick the switch around back on your power supply,

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.704
give it a second, and then hit the power button.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:45.905
If nothing happens,

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.741
you can refer to our last PC guide you'll ever need

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.910
for some helpful troubleshooting tips.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.778
Before you do that, though,

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:53.379
make sure your surge protector

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.481
is plugged in and turned on too.

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:58.117
It's actually a more common mistake than you think.

00:06:58.117 --> 00:06:59.719
Is it gonna power on first try?

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.988
Oh, crap.

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:03.356
Oh, power needs to be on.

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:05.191
Oh, even for us.

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:06.859
Now that fan spin is achieved,

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:08.561
it's time to game, right?

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:09.395
Not yet.

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.596
Nearly every modern computer

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:13.933
has what we still refer to incorrectly as a BIOS.

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.835
The more modern term is UEFI,

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:17.637
but we're old school,

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.472
so BIOS is the screen you go to when you power on your PC,

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:22.275
and it usually has the logo of the manufacturer.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.443
It's not just an ad, though.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.244
There's a whole menu buried in here

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:26.412
if you press the right key

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:28.648
before your operating system starts to boot up.

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.117
Sometimes the key you need to press to access it

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.418
is listed on the screen,

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:36.656
but it'll usually be Delete, F2, F10, or F12.

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:38.391
If you're unsure, check your manual.

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:41.294
Failing that, just mash all the above.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.496
That usually gets the job done.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:47.099
The exact layout of this setup screen will vary a lot,

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:48.334
depending on the manufacturer

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:50.436
and model year of your system.

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:52.772
There are DIY motherboards from a decade ago

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:54.707
with full graphical interfaces,

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:56.209
while some modern machines

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.977
have almost retro-looking interfaces

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.512
with no mouse support.

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:00.480
Whatever the layout,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.515
the first screen usually has information

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:05.117
about the hardware installed, the date and time,

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:07.653
and sometimes the order of the storage devices

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:10.923
the PC will check for an operating system to boot.

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:12.058
Before continuing,

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:14.494
make sure that everything is showing up as expected.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.761
Missing RAM, for example,

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:19.665
could mean you need to reseat the module or the CPU itself.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.968
Even if you've been around the block a few times,

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:24.470
you should check the manual to familiarize yourself

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.973
with the layout before changing anything.

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:29.041
After all, new platforms bring new features,

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:31.978
and new features bring new headaches.

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:33.913
It's at this point that you might want,

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:36.916
or sometimes need, to upgrade your BIOS

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.618
to the latest version on your motherboard

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:41.053
or PC manufacturer's website.

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:44.190
The exact steps for this vary greatly

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.294
by manufacturer and by era, but the gist is this.

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:51.631
Turn off the PC, download the BIOS from the manufacturer,

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:53.599
and unzip it to a flash drive,

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:56.536
which often must be formatted FAT32.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.739
Once that's done, eject it, plug it into your PC,

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:02.375
again, on a motherboard chipset port,

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.543
get back into the BIOS,

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.611
and usually you'll find an option here

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.580
with Flash in its name.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.082
Nine times out of 10, this is what you want.

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:12.752
Select the flash drive, choose the file you downloaded,

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:14.687
confirm, then kick back

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:17.723
and hope that the power doesn't go out.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.659
Your system may reboot a couple of times

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:22.094
during this process, which is normal,

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:24.730
but if it suffers a power loss,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.966
it's quite vulnerable as being bricked,

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:31.137
so if you have a battery backup of some sort kicking around,

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:32.572
please do use it.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.841
There are sometimes ways to recover without this backup,

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:38.010
but the exact details vary by vendor,

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.712
and you do not want to find out

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:42.014
that yours doesn't have one after the fact.

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:44.083
Read your motherboard's manual to be sure.

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:46.419
Once it's done, it should say the BIOS was updated

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.620
and settings were reset,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.256
allowing you to enter setup to continue.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.892
Now, there are a few options of particular interest

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:56.562
inside the BIOS, starting with XMP and XBO,

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:58.030
the memory overclocking standards

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.766
that were also previously known as DOCP

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:02.768
on older AMD platforms.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:05.504
The location of the setting does vary a little bit,

00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:08.240
but many motherboards will have it on the main page

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.675
because it is such a common thing

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:11.711
for enthusiasts to enable.

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:14.280
If you've got RAM that's rated for high speeds,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.851
this is a one-touch way to hopefully reach those speeds.

00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:21.721
Enabling it will correctly set all of the relevant settings

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:22.655
in your motherboard BIOS,

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:26.258
including voltages and something called the memory ratio.

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:28.361
You don't need to fully understand what that means,

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:31.731
but for best performance, one-to-one is ideal on Intel,

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.633
and on AMD, you often want to see

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:37.403
the F clock match half of the memory speed.

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:39.705
Don't worry too much if it doesn't line up, though.

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:43.376
Fast RAM is usually better than the alternative.

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:46.178
Now, this is technically overclocking, though,

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:48.214
so it's worth noting that this might not work

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:49.815
in every configuration.

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.851
If you have very fast memory

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:54.920
or if you have more than two modules, for example,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.391
your CPU may have trouble running at the rated speeds.

00:10:58.391 --> 00:10:59.825
If you're worried about stability,

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:02.061
you can go ahead and leave this step till last then

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:03.763
when your system is fully set up.

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:06.098
That way, you could even benchmark the before and after

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:08.200
if you happen to be a turbo nerd like me.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.570
If you do enable XMP and find that your system fails to boot

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.639
or is occasionally unstable,

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.975
manually dialing back the memory speed

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:17.943
or slightly increasing the voltage

00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:19.478
might make the difference.

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:20.479
Worst case scenario,

00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:22.581
you can disable memory overclocking entirely

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:24.650
and everything should work normally.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.651
If it doesn't,

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:28.254
you could be looking at a warranty replacement.

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:30.723
Next up, if you've got a beefy enough cooler,

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:34.160
some BIOSes let you toggle a setting like Core Enhancement

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.562
or Precision Boost Enhancement.

00:11:36.562 --> 00:11:39.598
This can help eek a little bit more performance out

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:41.901
at the cost of additional heat and power draw

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:46.172
by making your CPU turbo more aggressively or for longer.

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.607
This one is less likely to harm stability,

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:50.643
but again, if you experience problems,

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:53.112
I'd recommend just turning it off.

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:55.448
Our next stop will be Resizable BAR,

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:57.717
a feature that boosts GPU performance

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.719
by giving the system more efficient access

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:01.253
to its onboard memory.

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:04.123
This is usually gonna be somewhere in the advanced section,

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:06.592
often under a heading for PCI devices.

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:07.660
If you don't see it,

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.862
it's possible your motherboard doesn't support it,

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:12.631
but it's also possible that you need to enable

00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:15.634
above 4G decoding in order for it to show up.

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.036
Unlike memory overclocking,

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.871
this setting has no real downside,

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:21.240
so you might as well enable it.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.642
It won't do anything if your GPU doesn't support it

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:25.578
and on some modern GPUs,

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:28.714
it is basically essential for proper performance

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.983
to the point where the very newest motherboards

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:34.053
as of writing might ship with this on by default.

00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:35.888
Another option we wanna make sure is enabled

00:12:35.888 --> 00:12:37.323
is virtualization.

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:39.792
On Intel, this is often called VTX,

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:42.161
while AMD calls it SVM.

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:44.830
Along with letting you run virtual machines if you want to,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.766
with very little performance penalty,

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.802
virtualization technology is used by operating systems

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:52.671
to enhance security by sectioning off parts of the system,

00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:57.676
which is generally considered to be a very good idea, TM.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.078
This is often buried inside

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:01.313
the CPU configuration setting section,

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:02.815
and like resizable bar,

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:06.252
the newest motherboards may ship with this on by default.

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:10.222
A related setting is the Trusted Platform Module or TPM.

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:12.892
Windows 11 mandates it as the second part

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:15.494
of its virtualization-based security feature

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:18.297
and for improving Windows Hello biometric login

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.800
and BitLocker disk encryption security.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.736
For that reason, it's usually best to keep it enabled

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:25.704
or enable it if it isn't already.

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:28.541
Otherwise, no Windows 11 for you,

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.509
at least not officially anyway.

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:32.678
You'll also officially get no Windows 11

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:34.313
if you don't enable Secure Boot,

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.282
which helps guarantee that nothing malicious

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:37.817
slipped in between the BIOS

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.251
and loading the operating system.

00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.753
This could be a simple toggle,

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:42.254
or you might need to select the option

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:45.191
to install the default keys like on this board from Asus,

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:46.792
but if that option doesn't show up anywhere,

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:48.127
it could be that CSM,

00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:50.262
or Compatibility Support Module, is enabled,

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:53.199
which puts the computer into a sort of old-school boot mode,

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:55.100
and Secure Boot doesn't roll that way.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.002
So unless you know that you actually need it,

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:59.171
it's usually best to disable CSM.

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:01.440
One hot tip that might save you some headaches later

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.276
is to determine what onboard hardware you don't need.

00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:06.579
For example, motherboards with built-in wireless,

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:09.215
secondary LAN ports, or any other extras

00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:11.150
will have them all enabled by default,

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.086
and they can sometimes be excessively chatty.

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:16.422
This often manifests as stuttering or hitching,

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:18.791
even when the system isn't even close to fully loaded,

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.093
because the CPU has to drop whatever it's doing

00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:23.195
to listen to your Wi-Fi card go blah, blah, blah

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.364
about the signal strength of your neighbor's Wi-Fi

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.599
that you're not even using.

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:28.100
So take a moment and disable anything

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.935
you're 100% sure you don't need.

00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:31.337
Just remember you did it,

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:32.738
so you're not tearing your hair out later

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:33.539
trying to figure out

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.341
why your serial port drivers won't install.

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:36.609
There are a handful of other features

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:37.776
you might wish to play around with.

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:40.446
For example, you might want to reorder your boot devices

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:43.115
or set up custom fan control if your board supports it,

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:43.949
but for the most part,

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:46.352
you should leave the rest of the stuff in here alone,

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:47.620
especially voltages,

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.221
unless you're sure you know what they do

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:50.623
and accept the risks.

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:52.658
For now, if you built your own PC,

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.894
it's time to install your operating system.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.662
Or if you bought a prebuilt,

00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:58.597
it's time to install your operating system.

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:01.133
I mean, you don't, strictly speaking, have to,

00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:02.935
but since so many machines

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:04.937
come with bloatware pre-installed on them,

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:08.274
it may actually take less time to just load up a fresh one

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:10.643
than to sanitize what you've already got.

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.978
Step one then is to download your OS.

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:14.847
We're gonna use Windows 11 as our example,

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:17.850
but most of this also applies to Windows 10.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.986
Microsoft provides a free tool to download an ISO

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.155
that can either be saved so you can burn it

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:26.292
or used to automatically build a USB installer.

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.294
We're gonna have that linked down below.

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.696
Download it, grab your USB flash drive,

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.631
and make sure that anything you care about on it

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:33.832
is backed up,

00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:35.701
because this is gonna wipe it clean.

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:36.802
Go through the prompts.

00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:39.571
The recommended version is almost always what you want,

00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:42.041
and choose USB flash drive.

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:44.843
Select the drive, and it's off to the races.

00:15:44.843 --> 00:15:46.211
While you wait for this to finish,

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:47.613
I would strongly recommend

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.214
downloading your hardware drivers

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:51.150
from the manufacturer's websites.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.752
In particular, you are definitely going to want

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:55.054
your network driver,

00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:58.057
and some systems might also need the storage driver

00:15:58.057 --> 00:16:00.793
in order to get through the Windows setup process.

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.161
I usually just grab it all,

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:03.395
because storage is cheap,

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:05.698
and I'm not doing anything right now anyway.

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:07.633
Once the Windows flash drive is finished,

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.068
unzip the drivers to it.

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:12.104
I like making a drivers folder with individual folders

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:14.239
for each driver to keep them easy to find.

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:18.010
Then eject it and pop it into your new PC and restart it.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.713
It should boot right into the installer,

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:21.780
but if it doesn't,

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.483
you should be able to choose the installer from the BIOS

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:25.751
or through a boot menu,

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:29.088
which is usually accessible by mashing F8 or F12

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:30.823
on the BIOS screen.

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:31.657
Fun fact,

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.492
did you know that you can open a command prompt

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.194
at any time during Windows setup

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:37.496
by holding Shift and pressing F10?

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:39.999
A fun little pro tip is if you do this

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.435
and then type diskpart right at the beginning and hit Enter,

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:45.004
then list disk,

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.940
you can see all the drives that are installed on the PC.

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:50.509
That way, if your storage device isn't showing up,

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:52.144
it's a faster way to know,

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:54.880
and you can quickly reboot the system and troubleshoot it.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.948
And if it is showing up,

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:58.917
you can type select disk followed by the number next to it

00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:02.254
and type clean to remove anything from that drive.

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:03.422
If you want to be really sure

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:04.690
and you have some time to kill,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.292
clean all will crawl the drive

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:10.095
and directly set every single bit to zero,

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:11.930
which is basically a secure erase,

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.298
though that takes a while,

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:15.334
especially with higher capacity drives.

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:17.302
Once you're done, type exit twice,

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:19.838
hitting Enter both times to close the command window,

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:21.874
then proceed through the prompts.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.675
If you come to the part where you need to select

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:25.911
where to install Windows and nothing is there,

00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:28.247
it's time to put that storage driver to use.

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:29.648
Click load driver,

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:31.450
then find the folder on the flash drive

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.619
that you unzipped your storage driver to.

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:35.654
With any luck, the driver will pick up your drive

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:37.756
and you can proceed as normal.

00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:39.324
In some situations, by the way,

00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:42.127
Windows does a thing and splits your install

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:43.862
across two drives.

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:46.098
Most often, if one of the installed drives

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:48.300
has an existing Windows partition on it.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.002
So if you have an old drive

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:51.670
that you're planning to copy data from

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.372
that has an operating system,

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:56.442
I would strongly recommend shutting down the system

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:59.511
and removing it until you've finished the setup process.

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:02.748
Now, most people will want to select the unallocated space

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:05.818
for the drive you want to install Windows on and continue.

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:07.786
But if you only have one drive

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:09.354
and you want to separate Windows

00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:11.056
from your documents, games, et cetera,

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:14.560
so that you can wipe Windows clean without worry later,

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.662
then you can create a new partition

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:19.131
for just that with this button.

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:21.400
This will steal the amount of storage capacity

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.335
you choose for it from the Windows drive.

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:24.603
So you'll have to make the call

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:26.538
on how much to assign to Windows

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:28.140
and to your storage drive

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.342
based on what you expect to need installed

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:31.276
on your Windows drive.

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:33.479
You can then click the remaining unallocated space

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.280
to install Windows to it.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.116
It'll set up everything on its own.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:40.085
When you're satisfied, click next and make a sandwich.

00:18:40.085 --> 00:18:40.919
Quickly though,

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.622
because this shouldn't take too long on a modern PC.

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:44.823
After a reboot or two,

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:46.959
you should see the screen to get connected to the network

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.494
and download updates.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.095
If nothing comes up here,

00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:52.631
this is where those network drivers come in.

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.633
Press shift and F10 again,

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:58.737
then devmanagement.msc and hit enter.

00:18:58.737 --> 00:19:02.107
Find the unknown devices called ethernet controllers,

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:04.810
right click them and click update driver.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.146
Again, browse to where you extracted the drivers

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:09.615
to your USB drive and it should pick them up.

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:12.251
Unfortunately, Windows doesn't give you an easy way

00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:13.619
to know which one is which.

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:15.487
So there might be a bit of trial and error

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:17.723
with selecting the right driver for each controller

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:19.258
if you have more than one.

00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:22.094
Or if you get bored of this monkey business entirely,

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:24.196
you can just bring the command prompt back up

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:27.599
and type UBI backslash bypass NRO.

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:29.735
And then you can just deal with the network drivers

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:31.203
once you hit the desktop.

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:33.539
Fun fact, this also removes the requirement

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:35.807
for an online Microsoft account.

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:38.076
If you're successful installing network drivers however,

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:40.212
your yellow exclamation point should disappear

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:42.548
from device manager, allowing you to proceed.

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:43.916
That's the end of the hard part.

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:46.552
So we're just gonna mostly skip over the rest,

00:19:46.552 --> 00:19:48.220
just noting that we would suggest

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.656
turning off most of the analytics options

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:52.658
and oh, make sure you take a note

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:54.560
of that restore from backup option

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.495
if you did use a Microsoft account.

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.664
You're gonna learn what that's for later.

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:02.100
Now that you're on the desktop then, now what?

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.836
Well, first order of business is drivers.

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:07.839
Some systems will offer to install them automatically

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:09.174
using built-in software.

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:11.443
And some of those let you thankfully disable

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:13.779
that feature in the BIOS if you don't like software

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:15.914
you can't control lurking inside your system.

00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:19.751
But more importantly, it can also lead to extra bloat

00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:21.720
being installed on your machine.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.922
For now, you should install all the drivers

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:25.257
you downloaded previously,

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:26.992
which might take a couple of reboots

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:28.193
before you get through them all,

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:29.795
but should be fairly straightforward

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:31.897
for most driver packages nowadays.

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:34.399
If all you have is a cab file and an INF file,

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:36.201
you might have to go to the device manager

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:38.870
and use that update driver trick that we showed you earlier,

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.672
but that shouldn't be a big deal.

00:20:40.672 --> 00:20:41.707
Once everything's installed

00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:43.642
and your yellow exclamation marks are gone,

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:45.410
go ahead and grab Windows updates

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.112
until there aren't any more,

00:20:47.112 --> 00:20:50.015
then right click the taskbar, go to taskbar settings,

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:51.850
then remove search cause it's pointless

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.085
and left align the start menu

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.754
because you are a man or lady of culture.

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:58.056
Now you're ready to start getting settled in.

00:20:58.056 --> 00:21:00.392
If you have any Bluetooth devices that you wanna connect,

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:02.194
you can do that through the Bluetooth icon

00:21:02.194 --> 00:21:03.428
in the system tray.

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.931
Just click add device, choose Bluetooth

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.200
and make sure that your device is in pairing mode.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.701
It should show up in a few seconds

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.436
and then all you need to do is select it

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.372
and follow the instructions on screen.

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:15.140
Some devices will connect right away

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.209
while others may need you to press a button

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:19.211
or key in a code to confirm.

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:20.412
Once the device is connected,

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:21.913
it should reconnect automatically

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:23.482
every time it's turned on.

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:25.417
If you later pair it with another device though

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:27.286
and it no longer works with your PC,

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.021
just look for it in the devices list,

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:30.455
click the three dots to forget it

00:21:30.455 --> 00:21:32.691
and go through the pairing process again.

00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:34.493
Once you're satisfied everything is connected,

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:36.461
it's time to check your network config.

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.963
Windows has a firewall built in

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.399
to protect your PC from unauthorized access

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:41.300
from your network,

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.069
but it has two modes that define how strict it will be.

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:46.705
The first, nowadays the default, is public,

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:49.341
which treats all incoming connections with suspicion

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:52.411
unless you specifically allow an app to accept them.

00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:55.080
This is great for connecting to unsecured public Wi-Fi

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.415
at your favorite coffee shop,

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:57.482
but if you have a home network

00:21:57.482 --> 00:21:58.750
and you'd like to share files,

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.752
you'll wanna change over your connection to private,

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:02.788
which relaxes security to allow connection

00:22:02.788 --> 00:22:03.955
from your local network.

00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:05.991
You can change this by right clicking the network icon

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:06.892
in the system tray,

00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:08.894
then clicking network and internet settings.

00:22:08.894 --> 00:22:10.495
Click on the network connection you wanna change,

00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:13.365
then toggle either private or public as desired.

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:14.533
The next thing you'll wanna do,

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:16.835
especially if you're sharing files on the network,

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:18.370
is to set up your power options

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.806
in the settings app under system, then power.

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:22.974
Here you can set when your PC goes to sleep,

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:24.376
when your screens go to sleep,

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:26.678
and how aggressively your PC should try to optimize

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.647
for performance or power usage.

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:30.716
By default, Windows will set your PC to sleep

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:31.950
after 10 minutes,

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.152
but if you're a fan of accessing your PC remotely

00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:36.688
through an app like TeamViewer, Parsec, or Tailscale,

00:22:37.422 --> 00:22:38.590
or sharing files like we mentioned earlier,

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.359
it'll be inaccessible while it's asleep

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:42.461
without some very specific steps.

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:45.330
In that case, you might wanna set your PC to never sleep,

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.732
though that does mean you'll be missing out

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:48.400
on those sleep power savings.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.335
You can, however, tune that power drop

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:52.637
by searching for edit power plan in the start menu

00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:54.906
and clicking the change advanced power settings link

00:22:54.906 --> 00:22:56.908
in the vintage window that pops up.

00:22:56.908 --> 00:22:57.976
There are a bunch of settings here,

00:22:57.976 --> 00:23:00.178
ranging from when to turn off spinning hard disks,

00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:02.481
and how many power saving features are enabled

00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:05.650
for your Wi-Fi, USB, and PCI Express devices,

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.619
as well as the ability to set the minimum

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:09.721
and maximum performance of your CPU.

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:12.124
These options can also be useful for troubleshooting things

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:14.259
like periodic dropouts and disconnections.

00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:16.528
For example, if your USB cable is good

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:17.763
and the port is good,

00:23:17.763 --> 00:23:20.232
try turning off USB selective suspend,

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:21.800
or if your Wi-Fi is unreliable,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.035
you can try setting it to maximum performance.

00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:26.304
Now that your devices and core settings are set up,

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:28.974
you'll wanna tweak some of the more common user settings.

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:31.610
For example, most gamers don't like mouse acceleration,

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:32.911
and the easiest way to find this

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:34.980
is by typing mouse in the start menu search

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.748
and then selecting change the mouse pointer

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:38.016
display or speed.

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:39.918
In this window, click pointer options,

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:42.854
then uncheck enhance pointer precision if it's enabled.

00:23:42.854 --> 00:23:45.090
You should generally leave the cursor speed where it is

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.559
and use DPI switching that's built into your mouse

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.428
or mouse software for that instead.

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:51.196
You can change the other options here to taste

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:53.465
or lack thereof, but for now, just hit okay.

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:55.934
It's a good idea at this point

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:57.569
to set up some file explorer settings

00:23:57.569 --> 00:23:58.703
by hitting these dots here

00:23:58.703 --> 00:24:00.739
and opening up the options window.

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:02.274
Here, among other things,

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:04.843
we can choose whether to see the default home view

00:24:05.677 --> 00:24:07.813
with recent documents or the this PC view

00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:10.715
where only drives attached to the system are shown.

00:24:10.715 --> 00:24:12.851
If you'd like to avoid getting duped by the way,

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:15.220
like when we had our channel hacked recently,

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.888
you should then go to view

00:24:16.888 --> 00:24:20.292
and uncheck hide extensions for known file types.

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:24.463
I will never understand why this is enabled by default.

00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:25.964
There are some other options in here

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:27.833
like showing hidden files,

00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:29.835
restoring previous windows when restarting

00:24:29.835 --> 00:24:31.036
and so on and so forth.

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:33.538
So go ahead and modify to suit your tastes

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:35.440
or click on restore defaults

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.509
if you can't find that one option that you changed

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:38.944
that you ended up not liking.

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:40.479
One more thing you'll notice in this window

00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:42.681
is the apply to folders button.

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:43.915
What's that do?

00:24:43.915 --> 00:24:47.118
Well, if you right click empty space in an Explorer window,

00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:48.587
you're gonna see a view option

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:50.455
with a bunch of different layouts.

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:51.823
Here's what each of them looks like

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:53.558
and here's the available columns

00:24:53.558 --> 00:24:55.560
to sort with the details view.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.628
Regardless of the view,

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:59.464
you can sort or group by these criteria.

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:00.732
Grouping by date, by the way,

00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:04.402
is a great way to sort your downloads and your photos.

00:25:04.402 --> 00:25:06.004
If you get it set up just right

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:07.339
and you wanna use that layout

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.975
as the default for all folders on your PC,

00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:12.644
that's what the apply to folders button does.

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:14.112
If you want a specific folder

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:16.648
to show large icons or thumbnails,

00:25:16.648 --> 00:25:18.383
you can set it separately,

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:19.951
which is pretty neat, right?

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:21.953
And don't worry if you mess something up,

00:25:21.953 --> 00:25:25.090
the reset folders button is always there to help you.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.157
Speaking of folders,

00:25:26.157 --> 00:25:27.993
did you know you can change the locations

00:25:27.993 --> 00:25:29.995
of these main folders here?

00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:32.230
Just right click on them, click properties,

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.099
and then look at the location tab.

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:37.335
Click move and you'll be able to choose a new spot for them.

00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:39.471
It doesn't work very well with OneDrive,

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.273
but if you've got a separate drive

00:25:41.273 --> 00:25:43.642
or a partition that you'd like to use for your files

00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:47.078
while keeping Windows separate, this is for you.

00:25:47.078 --> 00:25:48.013
When you click okay,

00:25:48.013 --> 00:25:50.749
it'll even ask if it should move any existing files

00:25:50.749 --> 00:25:51.983
over to the new location,

00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:54.519
which is super handy if you're doing this on a system

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:57.722
that you've already kind of moved into.

00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:59.391
Of course, there's a more fundamental way

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.926
to personalize your PC.

00:26:00.926 --> 00:26:03.595
If you right click the desktop and click personalization,

00:26:03.595 --> 00:26:05.597
you'll find options to change the background,

00:26:05.597 --> 00:26:07.132
colors, and more.

00:26:07.132 --> 00:26:09.200
You can even have a group of background pictures

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.337
that will change periodically if you use slideshow.

00:26:12.337 --> 00:26:14.673
Under colors, you can choose whether you're on the light

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:17.075
or dark side, enable or disable

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:19.477
the microtransparency effect on some windows,

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:21.479
and manually select an accent color

00:26:21.479 --> 00:26:22.647
if you don't like what Windows chose

00:26:22.647 --> 00:26:24.015
to match your background.

00:26:24.015 --> 00:26:26.451
Oh, and you can choose whether it should apply

00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:29.120
to the taskbar and to Windows too.

00:26:29.854 --> 00:26:32.490
A special note here is the contrast theme section.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:33.992
This can be really helpful

00:26:33.992 --> 00:26:35.760
for people with visual impairments

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.896
or just to look cool if you dig the aesthetic

00:26:37.896 --> 00:26:40.231
because it applies everywhere

00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:43.401
and you can edit the colors that it selects yourself.

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:44.436
There's some other useful stuff

00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:46.838
in the accessibility section of the settings app too.

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:49.741
For example, you can make scroll bars always show

00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:51.376
if you hate the auto hide stick,

00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:54.579
you can turn off Windows animations for faster navigation,

00:26:54.579 --> 00:26:57.282
you can change the size and style of your cursor,

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:59.551
and importantly for people who don't use them,

00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:01.620
you can disable the keyboard shortcuts

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.955
for sticky keys and filter keys.

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:06.491
Oh, that toggle keys function can be helpful too.

00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:08.727
It plays a beep whenever you enable caps lock,

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:10.161
num lock, or scroll lock,

00:27:10.161 --> 00:27:11.663
so you don't have to look down at your keyboard

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:12.697
to see if they're on.

00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:15.367
A common problem for monitors

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:18.003
is that either HDR or high refresh rate

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:20.271
aren't set up correctly by default,

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:22.574
even though your display supports it.

00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:24.743
You can fix that by right clicking on the desktop

00:27:24.743 --> 00:27:26.444
and clicking display settings.

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:27.746
HDR settings can be found

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:29.314
in the brightness and color section

00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:32.317
and clicking on it gives you the option to enable HDR

00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:33.785
as well as auto HDR,

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:37.522
which will cause non HDR games to pretend their HDR

00:27:37.522 --> 00:27:40.291
with honestly mixed results.

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:42.961
You can also adjust how SDR content will appear

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:46.031
when you're in HDR mode using this slider,

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:48.833
which will also affect the brightness of the desktop.

00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:51.336
If you have multiple HDR monitors,

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:53.238
congrats you fancy pants you,

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:55.473
you can adjust them independently of each other.

00:27:55.473 --> 00:27:57.342
Also, HDR or not,

00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:58.677
if you have multiple monitors

00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:00.045
and they're not in the right order

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:01.880
and you haven't already fixed it yourself

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.182
because of how infuriating it was,

00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:06.151
you can drag them around in the display settings window

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:07.886
like this and even rotate them

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:09.854
if you like having one in portrait

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:11.823
or even one upside down

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:14.259
using the display orientation dropdown.

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:17.062
You can see which is which by using the identify button

00:28:17.062 --> 00:28:18.329
to make this a bit easier

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:20.832
and you can choose which one is your main display,

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:24.335
so the one with the system tray using this checkbox here.

00:28:24.335 --> 00:28:25.570
One little pro tip by the way,

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.472
is that if your cursor jumps

00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:29.107
as you move between the displays,

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:32.077
you can tweak the alignment in this menu like so.

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:34.512
If your monitors are different sizes and resolutions,

00:28:34.512 --> 00:28:36.614
you're not gonna be able to get it absolutely perfect,

00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:39.517
but it'll at least help smooth things a little bit.

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:40.518
For refresh rate,

00:28:40.518 --> 00:28:43.521
you're gonna need to scroll down to advanced display.

00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:45.490
From here, you can choose each of your monitors

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.891
individually up top

00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:49.294
and then select the refresh rate down below.

00:28:49.294 --> 00:28:52.864
Now Windows is usually okay about selecting refresh rates,

00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:54.733
but overclocked monitors,

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:57.435
including monitors with overclock functions

00:28:57.435 --> 00:28:58.737
right out of the box,

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:02.040
will often report the non overclocked refresh rate

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.641
as the best one.

00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:05.777
And that is just factually incorrect.

00:29:05.777 --> 00:29:08.113
So if you still don't see your refresh rate,

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:11.282
you might need to use your GPU's configuration utility

00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:13.518
or try a different cable.

00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:15.353
Another thing Windows guesses at,

00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:17.522
sometimes with comically bad results,

00:29:17.522 --> 00:29:20.058
is the size that you might prefer for your windows

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:21.392
and for your text.

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:23.228
If you want things larger or smaller,

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:24.295
just look for scale

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:26.798
about halfway down the display settings window.

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:31.269
A 27 inch 4K monitor will typically be set to 150%,

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:33.938
which is roughly equivalent to how big things would look

00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:35.840
if it were 1440p.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.877
If you were to set that 4K display to 200%,

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:41.746
it would look like if it was 1080p at that size,

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:44.749
just sharper and so on and so forth.

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:46.251
If you've got multiple monitors,

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:47.952
you can select each one independently

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:48.987
at the top of the window

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:50.655
and then choose different scales.

00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:54.259
So for example, 100% for a 1080p gaming monitor

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:58.563
and 200% for a secondary 4K content consumption monitor

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:01.533
could make things on screen appear to be the same size,

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:03.601
assuming that they're the same size physically.

00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:05.236
You're gonna have to experiment with it a little bit

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:06.337
and see what you like.

00:30:06.337 --> 00:30:08.973
And it's worth noting that you might have to log out

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:11.876
and log back in for it to take effect in every app.

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:14.112
Rather not enter your password again?

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:14.979
Well, good news.

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:16.381
If you're using a Microsoft account,

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:18.249
you can enable Windows Hello.

00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:19.217
What's it do?

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:21.352
It enables you to use your fingerprint, a pin,

00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:23.454
or your face with a compatible camera

00:30:23.454 --> 00:30:25.890
to log in without your password.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.091
Why would you do that?

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:29.060
First, forgetting your password sucks

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.563
and getting locked out of your PC sucks more.

00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:34.432
Second, it can actually be more secure

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:36.935
because typing out your password means a key logger

00:30:36.935 --> 00:30:39.370
or a particularly nosy housemate

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.306
might be able to read your keystrokes.

00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:43.074
This way, Windows Hello makes it

00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:44.676
so someone gaining access to your PC

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:47.779
doesn't also gain access to your Microsoft account.

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:49.714
To secure your PC even better

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:51.783
than a password alone ever could,

00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:53.451
you can use BitLocker.

00:30:53.451 --> 00:30:55.787
BitLocker encrypts your entire drive.

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:56.921
And while by default,

00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:59.023
it will only protect against someone cloning

00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:01.159
or removing your storage device,

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:03.661
you can optionally lock it down with a pin,

00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:06.231
a password, or a USB flash drive key

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:08.032
that's required before your PC

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:10.034
ever gets to the login screen.

00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:11.703
It's best to enable BitLocker shortly

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:12.904
after you install Windows

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:15.240
so the encryption doesn't take forever.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.241
But once it's encrypted,

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:18.843
it's super fast to encrypt and decrypt on the fly

00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:20.612
on modern hardware.

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:22.981
Your apps will barely even notice.

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:25.617
Speaking of apps, how do you install them?

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:28.219
Well, you could go to every website

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:30.021
and download the installers individually

00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:32.156
like some kind of cave person,

00:31:32.156 --> 00:31:35.393
but you could also use tools to make things simpler.

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:36.661
A classic is Nineite,

00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:38.563
which lets you batch download and install

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:41.099
a wide variety of apps in one shot.

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:42.934
It's a huge time-saver.

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:43.768
Here's some of the stuff

00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:46.537
that we might select for ourselves for a new install.

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:48.072
Just one pro tip here,

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:50.675
please don't install multiple anti-malware shields

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:53.111
if you value your sanity or your performance.

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:54.345
One is fine though.

00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:55.647
There are some other great options

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:57.215
for managing software too.

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:58.917
One of which is to use the Microsoft Store.

00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:00.752
And I know, I know, before you say it,

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:02.153
I know it's loaded with crapware

00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:03.855
and requires a Microsoft account,

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:06.057
but there are plenty of normal apps on there,

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:08.393
including a lot of the ones installed by Nineite.

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:10.695
And as a bonus, they're updated automatically

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:12.397
along with all your other store apps,

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:13.231
so you don't need to keep

00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:15.500
on top of app updates individually.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.402
Here's a bunch of our commonly installed apps

00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:19.037
that are available on the Microsoft Store.

00:32:19.037 --> 00:32:21.539
Another bonus is that they're automatically redownloaded

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:24.142
if you have to reinstall, which is pretty sick.

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:26.911
If you have more selective taste in software

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:29.280
or you just want to install everything in one place,

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.149
you can make use of a little known Windows feature

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:32.550
called WinGet.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.785
We brought this up previously

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:36.254
along with a third-party alternative, Chocolaty,

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:37.255
but with either of them,

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:38.856
you can search for the software you want,

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:41.592
copy the exact name and shove that into a batch file

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:43.561
with commands to install or update them.

00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:46.264
That can be a little tedious to maintain,

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:48.266
but the upside is you can keep that batch file

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:49.901
on a flash drive or cloud storage,

00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:51.502
so the next time you need to install Windows,

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:53.871
you can get back up and running extremely quickly.

00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:55.840
And like with the Microsoft Store,

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.475
you can schedule it to automatically check

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:58.643
for updates for you.

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:00.878
Steam is a special boy though.

00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:03.181
It's like an app store all on its own.

00:33:03.181 --> 00:33:05.984
Once installed, you've got Steam library folders

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:08.286
that contain anything that you download to them.

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:11.122
And if you have a separate drive that you'd like to use

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:12.390
instead of your Windows drive,

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.659
whether it's a partition or a physical one,

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:17.528
you'll need to go to Steam settings, then storage.

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:19.597
Click the plus next to your C drive,

00:33:19.597 --> 00:33:22.266
select your other drive, then click add.

00:33:22.266 --> 00:33:24.569
It's gonna show up right next to your C drive.

00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:27.138
Click the three dots and select make default

00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:29.974
to make sure that Steam install software to that drive

00:33:29.974 --> 00:33:32.343
instead of your main one by default.

00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:33.811
Then you're off to the races,

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:36.614
which is great and all, I hear you say,

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:38.750
but I've got these peripheral things

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.752
and my RGB is out of control.

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:42.520
What do I do?

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.255
Well, many peripherals these days

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:46.557
do come with driver software,

00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:48.593
but if you want my humble opinion,

00:33:48.593 --> 00:33:51.863
you should be asking yourself if you really need it

00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:53.998
before you click that download button.

00:33:53.998 --> 00:33:56.067
Even the most reputable vendors software

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:58.302
can be very resource intensive.

00:33:58.302 --> 00:34:00.638
And if you're not married to a single brand

00:34:00.638 --> 00:34:01.773
for all your peripherals,

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:04.776
you could end up with three or four different programs

00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:06.611
just to control your devices.

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:10.114
But okay, if you've got to have them,

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:13.618
what you can do to help with this is to install them,

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:15.887
then disable them from starting automatically

00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:19.057
using task manager's built-in startup items section.

00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:20.758
Just fire up task manager.

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:23.194
There's a few different ways to do this listed here,

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:25.930
but the pro move is of course, Control Shift Escape.

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:28.900
And then with this method, you can, for example,

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.170
set up your mouse DPI switches and all of your lighting,

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.138
save it to the mouse's onboard memory,

00:34:34.138 --> 00:34:36.874
then close the software for maximum gaming performance

00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:38.743
and only run it when it's necessary

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:40.278
to make your stuff work.

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:41.712
It's actually a good idea, by the way,

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:43.614
to check this list from time to time

00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:46.617
and disable anything that you don't want or need.

00:34:46.617 --> 00:34:48.252
The same goes for companion software

00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:50.555
that's installed by your hardware drivers.

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:51.722
This stuff can add up.

00:34:51.722 --> 00:34:54.892
I'm talking sound control panels, temperature monitors.

00:34:54.892 --> 00:34:56.494
I mean, the list goes on.

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:57.595
Let's be real.

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:59.597
They're usually not very polished

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:02.934
despite the alleged R&amp;D budgets of these companies.

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:04.936
So maybe try some third-party software

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:09.407
like the Piece Equalizer APO GUI or Hardware Info instead,

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:11.943
which can give you much greater granularity

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.445
and aren't tied to specific hardware.

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:16.114
Oh, since we're on the subject, by the way,

00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:19.117
Hardware Info is a great tool for double-checking

00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:21.119
that all your devices are actually showing up

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:23.955
and for making sure that you didn't make any mistakes

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:25.957
while you were installing your cooler.

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:29.994
A simple combination stress test like Cinebench and Firmware

00:35:29.994 --> 00:35:32.830
while monitoring your CPU and GPU core temperatures

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:36.134
will quickly reveal any critical errors in your build,

00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:38.970
hopefully before they become a long-term problem.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.341
Anything under 90 degrees here is probably fine,

00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:45.910
but we'd like to see 70 to 80,

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.012
though, of course, there are exceptions,

00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:50.681
like some high-performance CPUs, for example,

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:54.719
are gonna target 90 to 100 degrees or more,

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:56.354
whether you like it or not.

00:35:56.354 --> 00:36:00.958
Speaking of like it or not, RGB, it's there.

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:03.728
And I think the one thing we can all agree on,

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:04.762
love it or hate it,

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:08.132
is that the control software is a CPU hog.

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:09.600
For best performance, then,

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.203
I would recommend leaving that RGB alone,

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:14.939
either rainbow bar or off.

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:16.574
But if you must adjust it,

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:17.608
there are alternatives

00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:20.011
to the many vendor-specific RGB control apps

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:20.845
that are out there,

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:23.881
and Windows 11 even recently got control for this,

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:26.751
albeit with limited compatibility as of writing.

00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:28.653
But if you wanna try and consolidate your RGB

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:29.887
into a single app,

00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:32.790
just try OpenRGB or SignalRGB.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.593
OpenRGB tends to be lighter but less flashy,

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:37.728
while SignalRGB is more capable,

00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:40.798
but will make your CPU work for it like the others will.

00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:43.301
Like we had to work hard for this segue.

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:45.436
To our sponsor, Thorum.

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:46.771
It's Valentine's Day soon,

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:48.940
and as an iconic artist once said,

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.442
don't be mad once you see that you want it.

00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:54.412
If you liked it, then you should've put a ring on it.

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:56.113
Check out their handcrafted rings

00:36:56.113 --> 00:36:58.015
made from unconventional materials

00:36:58.015 --> 00:36:59.684
like wood from whiskey barrels

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:01.519
and World War II rifle stocks.

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:04.522
Every ring comes with an American walnut wooden ring box

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:07.191
and a free Thorum silicone activity band

00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:10.761
so you can put a ring on it twice just to be safe.

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:12.930
Thorum even makes minimalist watches

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.832
using some of the same unique materials

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:16.400
like koa wood from Hawaii

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.536
and Gibeon meteorite from space,

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:21.038
two of the most romantic locations, by the way.

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:23.674
Matthew McConaughey has, of course, been to both of them.
