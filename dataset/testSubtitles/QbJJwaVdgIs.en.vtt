00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.535
- That helicopter is
carrying a military squad,

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.904
and it's gonna land right over there.

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.506
(explosion booms)
If that squad successfully

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:07.907
hunts me down before the end of the day,

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:08.808
they get this hundred grand.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:09.642
Run, run, run.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.012
Get in, get in.
- Go, go, go.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:12.979
- Oh, they're running after us.

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:13.880
They are right on our tail,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.714
we gotta get outta here.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.616
I purposely put their car further away

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.550
so I can get a head start.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.885
- [Sean] Get in the vehicle, let's go!

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:19.853
Come on.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.988
(intense instrumental music)

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.323
- Right now he's not too far away.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.325
He's right on the other side
of these trees it looks like.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:26.726
- All right, we gotta be quick.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:28.595
Okay, we're crossing the bridge.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:29.729
Hey Chandler?

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:30.897
- Yeah?
- You know what to do.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.399
- I got you.
(engine rumbling)

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.266
I've been waiting for this.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.401
- So I've done this in the past

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.603
where I ran away from a
bounty hunter, and the FBI,

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:39.272
but I've never ran away
from three different people.

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:41.841
(intense instrumental music)

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.811
(explosion booming)

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.313
- I think Jimmy can get away now.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.349
- We're like a mile down
the road and I heard that.

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:52.185
- Ooh.
- Oh.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.521
- Yeah, you might have to go another way.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.890
- The quickest way out of
that field is this bridge

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.924
that we just blew up.
(explosion booming)

00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:59.793
So now they have to take the long way out,

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.028
and that should give me like a
five to 10 minute head start.

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:05.031
I rented an entire museum,
have dozens of cars,

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:08.001
giant military equipment,
and so much other cool stuff.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.335
This is just the beginning.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.338
- He's heading up, back up like northwest.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:13.540
- This is where things get fun.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.542
As you see the Squid Game mask over there,

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:16.643
we're in the right place.
- What?

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:17.577
Who is this guy?

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.712
- Now we are in a warehouse full of jeeps.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.147
Let's just say when they pull up,

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.649
they're gonna be very confused.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:23.483
Do you know what to do when they get here?

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.317
- No.
- No.

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:25.685
- [Jimmy] Just drive
in a random direction.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:26.986
- Right now?
- No, when they get here.

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:28.521
- Oh.
- And now we patiently wait

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.056
and monitor the security cam.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:32.092
- Looks like he's stopped at a building.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.893
- [Cameraman 2] What's the
strategy? Wait, is that a knife?

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.296
- Yeah.
- Is this the spot boys?

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:39.466
- Yeah, this is the spot.
(intense instrumental music)

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.135
- We've spotted the military
squad on the security cameras.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.770
All the doors on this building are locked.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.472
Let's see if they break
into the warehouse.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:46.506
- I'm gonna stay out front,

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.308
just in case somebody decides
to run out the front door.

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:49.976
- We're gonna check out the backside,

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:51.444
see if there's a vehicle back here.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.246
- So one of them is
waiting at the front door,

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:54.714
and two of them are in the back.

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.015
We're just gonna patiently wait.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:57.884
- The tracker is still in the building.

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.052
- [Zach] We got some glass doors

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.220
we can break up front here.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.054
- All right, sounds good.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:02.856
I'm gonna grab this to
go break some windows.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.824
- There are fresh tire
tracks leading in as well.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:05.859
- Jim's going to get the vehicle,

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.060
I'm gonna go ahead and break in.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.962
- [Sean] All right, go

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.830
(glass shattering)

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.232
- [Voice On Radio] Military
has breached the building.

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:13.466
It's time to go.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:17.270
- I should probably recline,
so its harder to see me.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.505
I'm gonna hide under this blanket,

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.039
so they can't see me in this car.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.441
Lock your doors.
- Go, go, go, now!

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.010
- Zach, let's roll back to the Hummer.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.645
(intense instrumental music)

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.115
(engine noise drown out speaker)

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.550
- [Jim] Which one? Which one?

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.518
- [Cameraman] That should
be them, right there.

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:32.886
- [Jimmy] Do they notice me?

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:33.820
- [Cameraman] We drove
right past each other.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.922
(intense instrumental music)

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.757
- We made it out with all the other teams.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:38.591
Oh my gosh!

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.493
Dude, they didn't even know how to react.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.461
- He's on the move again.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.363
He's straight ahead due south.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.698
- This is the tracker that
is telling the military squad

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:46.966
where I am at all times.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.602
And if I put the tracker
inside of this special bag,

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:50.470
it jams it.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.072
And now they don't know where I am.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:54.941
- It looks like the
vehicle may have stopped.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:55.775
- I don't see Jimmy.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:56.709
I think he's messing with us.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.378
- All right, so hold on. It just updated.

00:02:58.378 --> 00:02:59.646
He's straight north again.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:00.513
(Sean cheering)

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.650
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.884
- And now we're in the middle of nowhere.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.286
There's literally nothing out here,

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:09.022
except this old barn
that I had constructed.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.290
- Whoa.
- Mind if I set

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.257
my hundred grand right here?

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:12.091
Bad news.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.893
There's only two seats inside of here.

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:15.628
(Jimmy groans)

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.096
- I think I see them.
(duck quacks)

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.264
- Coming up on the tracker.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.365
- Holy cow, here they come!

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:20.500
- Check the car, and take the top.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.102
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
- Hey, hey, hey, look, look.

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.837
There he is. There he is.
- Brace yourself.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:26.239
(wood splintering)

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.674
(intense instrumental music)

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:30.276
- [Jim] Get in, get in.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.378
- [Sean] Let's go.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.047
- Oh my god!

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:34.881
- Run away! Don't stop!

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.349
Go!
- Hey guys! Guys!

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.717
Hey, I'd like to join your guys team,

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:38.585
what do you think?

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.420
- Get in.
- You think?

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.789
(Karl laughs)

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:43.723
- [Cameraman 2] That's not funny.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:44.857
- Saved Jimmy some time.

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:45.959
Hopefully that's enough.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.427
- Go, go, go, go, go.

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:48.461
- All right boys, here we go.

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.295
Let's go.

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:50.230
- It's this as quick as she goes?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.497
- Full speed.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:52.832
- There he is. There he is.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.267
We're coming for you Jimmy.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.102
- Oh my God! They're catching up!

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.003
Go!

00:03:57.003 --> 00:04:00.840
(intense instrumental music)

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:04.844
- [Cameraman] This is scary man!

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.246
- We're coming up on the rocks.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.180
(squad laughs)

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.014
- We got you!

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.015
- According to our calculations,

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:11.251
their cars shouldn't be
able to go over these rocks.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.518
All right.
- Here we go!

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:13.353
- Go, go, go, go.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:14.687
Just go.

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:18.758
(truck engine rumbling)

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:22.028
(cameraman laughs)

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:23.696
- [Cameraman] Later nerds!

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:24.764
- Let's go, yeah we can go.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:25.832
Just go.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.268
(intense instrumental music)

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.304
- Oh no!
(cameraman yelling)

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.138
- Clear.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.008
Boys let's go.
- Wait!

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:37.110
They weren't supposed to go over the rock!

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.811
- I don't think he thought
we were gonna do that.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:41.014
- Oh no! I'm screwed!

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.049
The plan was to get in
those porta potties,

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:44.517
but then the rocks didn't work.

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:45.418
Just go!

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:48.788
(intense instrumental music)
- [Zach] And what's the plan?

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:49.856
Let's think of a plan.
- The plan is

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:50.957
we're gonna catch him.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.659
(squad laughing)
- [Zach] That's it. That's it.

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.994
(intense instrumental music)

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.129
- Send the helicopter.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.996
Go, go, go.

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.332
(intense instrumental music)

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:00.166
- [Cameraman 2] You heard Jimmy?

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.000
- Hurry up, he's in there.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.068
He's in the truck.
- Get me out of this

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.269
and I'll give you ten grand.

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:04.771
- We're coming for you.

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.439
- That's a badass truck.
- Yeah it is! (Sean laughs)

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.440
They can't go very fast though.

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:10.643
(engine roaring)

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.545
- All right, we've got a proposition.

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:14.981
You double the money to 200K,

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.916
we'll give you 10 minutes from right now.

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.418
- What about 150?

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:19.619
- 150, deal?

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:20.887
Pull over Jim.
- Can we get

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:23.156
a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Blizzard?

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.123
- Do know who Mr. Beast is?

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:26.059
- Yeah, I do.
- We're actually chasing him

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:27.894
right now, so we're gonna
need these pretty quick.

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:30.630
We just gave Jimmy a 10 minute head start.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.765
We already decided we're
gonna donate the money anyway.

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.734
We know we can help out
a lot of people with it.

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:36.636
- And while the military got ice cream,

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:39.639
we buried Nolan alive so that
they would think he was me.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:40.773
(slow instrumental music)

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:41.908
Nolan?
- Yeah.

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:44.110
- Are you ready? I'm about
to drop my tracker down.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.712
I dropped it. Did you get it?

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.246
- No.
- Good cause I didn't drop it,

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:48.247
but I just did.

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:50.016
(Nolan groans)
- [Nolan] Ow, it hit my face

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.551
- Act like your me, I'm gonna go hide.

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:52.952
Me and Chris are hiding in the woods,

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:53.786
let's see what happens.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:54.921
Do you think they'll see us here?

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.190
I swear to god if we lose a 150
grand cause of your hiccups,

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.024
I'm gonna kill you.
(Chris hiccups)

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:58.991
- I can't help it, I can't get rid of-

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:00.626
- Can you just go walk down
and see if you find them?

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:01.461
- Yeah, sure.

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.995
It's very dark and spooky out here.

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:04.697
Couple of, oh...

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.666
You guys aren't very good
at being military people.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.368
Oh god! Don't tackle me.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.369
(Chris screams)

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.336
- I just heard Chris screaming.

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:11.170
I'm gonna call him.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.106
- [Chris] Jimmy they got me.
- Did you see that video

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.140
where I buried myself alive?

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.442
- We've done a lot of
reconnaissance on you my friend.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:17.276
- I can tell.

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:19.245
This whole video you've been
screwing up all my plans.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:20.079
It's annoying.

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:21.347
I'm currently buried alive.

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:22.181
Good luck.
(phone beeps)

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:23.015
I hung up on them.

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:24.484
That was a complete lie,
let's see if they fall for it.

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:26.619
- So right now he's still
supposed to be buried in here,

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:27.553
so we'll see.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:28.388
(phone rings)
- [Karl] Hello?

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.822
- Karl, they're almost here.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.391
You go investigate, report back.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.458
- Okay.
- Hurry.

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.960
(phone beeps)
These guys are good.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.495
I'm terrified.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:36.562
- Hello?

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:37.397
- [Jimmy] Who was it?

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.865
- Are these my Marine friends

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:40.433
that are right in front of my car?

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:41.267
- Is it a Hummer?

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:42.201
Wait Karl who is it?
- That are right

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.169
in front of my car.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:44.470
(engine rumbling)
- Karl, is it them?

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.139
- Hey, what's up?
- Karl, is it them?

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.540
Karl, is it them?

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.208
Karl! Karl!
- Wait before you go,

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.943
wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh,
you're driving away right now,

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:52.712
and he is driving through
the path right now.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:53.813
- They blocked off our exit route.

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.081
I have no idea what they are,

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.182
I'm just laying in the woods.

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:57.116
- Jimmy?
- Yeah?

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:59.552
- Earlier today, before we
jumped on the helicopter,

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:00.386
who'd you talk to?

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:02.021
- I don't remember, that
was a long time ago.

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:03.656
- Was it FaceTime or phone call?

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:04.757
- FaceTime.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:05.691
(Sean grunting)
- Not him.

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.093
- You couldn't have been
like, "I don't remember,

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.394
I'm Jimmy, I'm famous."

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:09.862
- I have the tracker.

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.864
You can't find Jimmy without me.

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:12.698
- Fair enough.

00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:14.400
- You literally have to dig me up.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.336
- You guys have to dig
up Nolan of all people.

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:18.171
- Hello?

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:19.539
- Let me know if he comes down this path.

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:20.840
- He's passing my car right now,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.575
you gotta go somewhere.

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.576
- [Jimmy] Yo, yo, yo.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.878
He literally just walked
right past me, oh my gosh!

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.880
- [Karl] Just move it that way.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.016
- I can't believe he
literally walked past me.

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:32.418
I've been laying down
on the side of the path.

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:34.854
(intense instrumental music)

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:36.722
- If you come to me right now, we're fine.

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:38.891
I moved their Humvee, so
it's not blocking us anymore.

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:39.959
- So the coast is clear Karl?

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.027
- Yes.
- Okay, I'm coming.

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:43.062
I'm trusting you.
- Okay.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:44.730
I don't actually know if it is.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.334
(intense instrumental music)

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:50.336
Close the door, oh my God!
- Just get us outta here.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.170
Go, go, go.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.738
Oh my God, I can't believe we got away!

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:54.941
We're currently driving
to the final location.

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:57.343
I literally rented an entire museum.

00:07:57.343 --> 00:08:01.481
Two hours until midnight,
$150,000 on the line,

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.517
let's do this.
(Karl cheers)

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:05.685
- Hey Nolan, just letting you know

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.687
they're contemplating breaking the glass.

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:08.521
- [Nolan] Oh don't...

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:09.455
No seriously, I'll die.

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:11.057
- If you tell me the information

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.692
that we need to know to keep moving,

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:13.693
I'll get the Bobcat,

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:15.328
and we'll dig you out
a hundred times faster

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.163
than Jim and I can dig
you out with shovels.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.397
Deal?
- Deal.

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:21.434
The North Carolina Museum
of Natural Sciences.

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:22.902
- I'm just letting you know,

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:25.037
they're not getting the
backhoe, they're leaving.

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:25.872
- No.
- All right,

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:26.939
we'll see you later Nolan, bye

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:27.874
- Are they lying?

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.008
Chris!

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:31.110
- And now we are finally at the museum.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.278
- Let's spend a night here.

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:34.113
- There's literally
multiple different floors

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:34.947
to this museum,

00:08:34.947 --> 00:08:36.282
and I could hide anywhere I want.

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.017
Now I'm gonna sit in
this corner right here,

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:40.520
and I'm gonna cover up
my back with this jacket.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.922
(Karl grunting)

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.924
Now I'm hidden below this makeshift rock.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:46.726
Cut the lights.

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:47.560
- Oh.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.494
I'm gonna go meet with them,

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:50.563
and try to get them to
go other directions.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:51.664
- [Jimmy] Okay, have fun.

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:52.498
(Humvee door slams)
- All right.

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:54.867
- Exactly an hour left to find Mr. Beast.

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.435
- The military guys are calling me.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:57.937
Hello?
- Hello?

00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:00.373
- I promise you I will
not leave this museum.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.507
I am in here somewhere.

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:02.441
Goodbye.
(phone beeps)

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:04.510
Why is it so much fun
to hang up on people?

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.511
- Hi guys.
- Hey.

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:06.679
- What are you guys looking for?

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.047
- [Jim] Ignore him, he's the enemy.

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:11.350
- I'd check the theater.
- I'd check the theater.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.618
- No.
- Yeah, he's not allowed

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:13.452
in there.

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:14.420
(all laughing)

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.755
Yes, he's probably this way.

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:17.390
- Ah, nope. That means no.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.225
Jimmy come out.

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.128
Do you know where Jimmy is?
- Yes I do,

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:23.329
and of course I'll tell you.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:25.765
- Okay, where is he?
(Sean groans)

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:26.599
Jimmy.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:27.934
All right, nothing.

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.201
- Hello?
- Did you by chance

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.970
go across any bridges?

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.104
- Lots of bridges,

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:34.707
especially the bridge I
blew up at start the video.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:36.342
(Jimmy cheers)
- Oh!

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:37.410
(Karl laughs)

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.878
We got 45 minutes.

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:39.712
- Jimmy.

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:41.147
We know you're here.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:44.216
(suspenseful music)

00:09:58.564 --> 00:09:59.799
- Oh no.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:00.866
What gave it away?

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:02.201
- Your shoes.
- Wait, really?

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:03.235
He's taking a picture
(camera snapping)

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:04.070
for his son.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.572
All right, get this
stupid rock off my head.

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:08.107
You guys just won a 150 grand.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:08.941
(squad cheering)
What are you

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:09.775
gonna spend it on?

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:12.211
- We're gonna donate it to
the HunterSeven Foundation.

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:14.180
The HunterSeven Foundation does research

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.450
on toxic exposures for veterans
from the last couple wars.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.518
- By the way, your friend
Nolan, he's still in the ground.

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:23.856
♪ Mr. Beast oh ♪
(explosion booming)

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:27.827
- Dig me out. Dig me out!
