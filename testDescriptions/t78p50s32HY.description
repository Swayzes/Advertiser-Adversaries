We have a TON of infrastructure and networking upgrades in the pipeline, but the first step was to both upgrade and correct some serious flaws in our networking. As is, a single failure could bring down our entire network for all three buildings. Today we fix that by building out a redundant high availability core switching setup with the help of Dell EMC's S5232F-ON 32 Port 100G switches, and a bunch of gear from FlexOptix, InfiniteCables, Ubiquiti, and Hammond Manufacturing!
