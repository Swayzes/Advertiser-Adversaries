00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.000
- I am not eating any food
for the next thirty days.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.900
- Wait, won't you be hungry?

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.460
- [Jimmy] This is what
I currently look like,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.410
and I weigh 220 pounds.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.750
And when I say no food, I really mean it.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.970
This was the hardest
I've ever pushed my body

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.110
in my entire life.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.030
Seriously, do not try this at home.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.940
I had a whole team of doctors
watching me every single day.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.070
They kept track of all
my vitals, like these,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.590
to ensure I didn't have
a heart attack, or worse.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.580
Thanks, doctors!

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.310
And if I for any reason eat
food in the next 30 days,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.930
Chris, you get to shave my head.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.763
- No way! - Yes.

00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:31.290
- There's no way he is going to 30 days.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.340
We're shaving his head.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.930
- The challenge has officially begun.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.401
- Guess you won't need these.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.400
(ceramic plate shattering)

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.351
- You're right. And
since I'm not eating for

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:41.070
the next 30 days,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.020
I might as well get rid of
all the food in my house.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.490
- Or are you eating?

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.930
- I'm not. - Or are you?

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.980
- I'm not eating.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.840
And can you guys help me
get rid of all this food?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.673
- Or is he?

00:00:49.673 --> 00:00:51.270
- It's like legit, take all my food.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.880
I don't want a single calorie
of food in this house.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.713
- Jimmy, question.

00:00:54.713 --> 00:00:57.510
If a fly flies into your mouth,
cause your mouth is open,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.580
and you accidentally swallow
it does that count as eating?

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.690
- Uh, probably.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.100
- Yeah, we're that serious.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.120
- Enjoy the food!

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.260
I'll see you guys later.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.790
You forgot the Cheetos. - Ow!

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.900
Tomorrow, we're bi...

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.980
- [Jimmy] Say it to the door.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.440
All right, the challenge
is now getting serious.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.140
The boys are gone, and my
kitchen is completely empty.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.183
Also, Chris accidentally
broke my microwave.

00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:16.680
(ceramic plate shattering)

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.730
- The microwave broke.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.720
- Thanks a lot, Chris.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.447
I'm laying in bed about to go to sleep,

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:23.430
and it feels weird not
having a snack before bed.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.263
I'm staying strong.

00:01:24.263 --> 00:01:25.680
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.930
Typically when I wake up
the first thing I do is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.690
I go eat breakfast, but
obviously I can't do that now.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.970
So, I guess I just go film videos.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.650
The only thing going in
my mouth for the next

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.000
twenty-eight days is water.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.890
Let's go see how much weight I've lost.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.100
To be honest, I probably
weigh basically the same.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.210
Yeah, like I said.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.280
And I'm about to go start
filming a different video;

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.260
so today's gonna be a
pretty difficult day.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.280
And the video we're filming is,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.500
we're seeing if this man
can spend a hundred days

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.333
in this circle.

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.390
Comment which you think is harder,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.740
spending a hundred days in a circle,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.240
or not eating food for 30 days.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.190
Filming on a completely empty stomach is

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.570
much harder than it sounds.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.236
By the end of it, I was drained.

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.090
(Jimmy weary sighing)

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.100
That's probably like four
or five hours of filming,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.840
and honestly, man, I need to go to bed.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.830
I'm tired now.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.540
- Hey, Chan-Chan, what you got there?

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.860
- [Chan] Oh, just some McDonald's.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.360
- I'm blowing the smells your way.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.193
- You are.

00:02:10.193 --> 00:02:12.510
- Jimmy, you want to eat me.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.770
- It's the end of day number two.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.870
Not gonna lie, I'm actually really hungry,

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.970
and yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.040
A lot of people say that
days three through six

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.500
are the hardest, but for
the most part I feel fine.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.850
I'm just a little sluggish.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.470
And I just feel tired.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.202
Taking my first poop
since I started fasting.

00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:29.035
(background bell chiming)

00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:30.210
How much do I weigh?

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.310
So, I'm down two and a half
pounds in the last day.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.720
That's actually pretty crazy.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.740
But it does make sense,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.570
because I took a giant poop this morning.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.648
We're about to do a photo
shoot for my snack brand,

00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:39.481
Feastables.

00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:40.557
And it sucks, because I can't eat 'em,

00:02:40.557 --> 00:02:42.420
and this is making me hungry.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.160
That's me smiling through the pain.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.720
You need me to take a bite of this?

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.553
- Yes.

00:02:46.553 --> 00:02:49.140
- They want a photo of me
taking a bite of the bar.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.040
Can I have permission?

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.136
I'll spit it out, I promise.

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:52.939
- [Chris] Yeah, you can
do that, if in the picture

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.126
you can have a shaved head.

00:02:54.126 --> 00:02:54.959
- [Jimmy] I hate you.

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:55.792
All right, I'm hanging up.

00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:57.630
Fake biting chocolate!

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.190
This morning I was like,
"Yeah, I'm not that hungry.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.090
This isn't too hard."

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.950
Now I'm like, "Bro, I need to eat food."

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.900
The boys told me they
have a surprise for me.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.850
Which is basically a
nice way of them saying,

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.900
they're about to torture me.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.310
- We just rented an ice cream truck.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.385
- Cause we wanna shave Jimmy's head.

00:03:10.385 --> 00:03:11.218
(frozen confection thudding)

00:03:11.218 --> 00:03:12.051
Oh, I'm sorry, Tareq!

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:13.039
- All right, let's go!

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.872
(truck speaker trilling
Turkey in the Straw melody)

00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:15.197
Yeah!

00:03:15.197 --> 00:03:16.260
Oh, Jimmy!

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.400
- I hear music outside,...

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.540
- [Chandler] Jimmy!

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.779
- and now they're screaming my name.

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.000
- [Chris] Jimmy!

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.840
- Oh my gosh.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.673
- [Chan] Hey.

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:23.506
- Hey, we got ice cream.

00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:24.870
- [Jimmy] Did you use
my credit card for this?

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.703
- Of course we did.

00:03:25.703 --> 00:03:26.880
What, would we use our own money?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.713
- Of course.

00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:28.546
Screw you guys.

00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:30.630
It just clicked in my head
that these goofy, goobers

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.953
are gonna be try to tempt
me this entire time.

00:03:32.953 --> 00:03:34.020
(frozen confection hitting house)

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.150
They're literally throwing
ice cream at my window.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.983
- [Tareq] Oh my God.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:37.816
(strained yelling)

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:38.649
(glass window shattering)

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:40.290
Did you guys just break the window?

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.123
- Jimmy!

00:03:41.123 --> 00:03:43.890
- Jimmy, watch out for the
broken glass in the ice cream.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.290
- You guys do realize I'm
renting this from a friend?

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.360
- [Friend] Hey, Jimmy, catch.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.193
(frozen confection thudding)

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:49.026
Did you guys have fun?

00:03:49.026 --> 00:03:49.859
- We have one more little trick.

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:50.717
- Oh, one more, of course.

00:03:50.717 --> 00:03:51.550
- We do have one more.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.383
- Let me guess you ordered pizza?

00:03:52.383 --> 00:03:53.910
(background crickets chirping)

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.873
Okay, get out here.

00:03:54.873 --> 00:03:56.340
Come on, all you guys go.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.380
Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah!

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.877
The boys smashed a window,...

00:03:59.877 --> 00:04:00.780
(window glass shattering)

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.820
and it doesn't seem safe
to sleep in a house with

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.690
an open window.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.660
I decided to just sleep
over at a friend's house.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.493
It's the morning.

00:04:07.493 --> 00:04:08.880
And I woke up with a headache.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.190
Doc said it should go
away within a day or two;

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.030
it's pretty normal.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.070
So yeah, I'm probably
not gonna do much today.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.040
Despite that I managed to drag
myself to the weigh in set,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.290
turns out I lost another half a pound.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.123
Good progress.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.460
Anyways, back to bed
for the rest of the day.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.770
Today is day five.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.150
I'm going to check with the doctor,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.650
check on the guy in the circle,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.900
film some tik toks, and
then figure out how I buy

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.820
a private island for a
hundred million subscribers.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.240
All right, I weigh 212.2 pounds.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.640
I lost another three pounds
over the last 24 hours.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.473
- Where does it go?

00:04:39.473 --> 00:04:40.306
- Bro, I don't know.

00:04:40.306 --> 00:04:41.310
- We should find it.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.020
- Currently, I'm getting
blood work done to prove

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.570
to you guys, and Chris
that I haven't eaten.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.160
Main thing I'm gonna be
looking for is a hormone

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.993
called leptin.

00:04:47.993 --> 00:04:49.216
It will tell me whether
you're eating, or not.

00:04:49.216 --> 00:04:50.310
They're gonna take a
couple days to come in.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.486
- We'll await the results.

00:04:51.486 --> 00:04:52.560
(electric razor buzzing)

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.330
- Today is day number six,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.640
and for whatever reason,
I'm feeling really good.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.510
I don't wanna get cocky,

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.100
cause I still have 24 days left,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.380
but I'm starting to think
this is actually possible.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.490
You guys know the deal,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.530
two hundred and ten point one pounds.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.360
Well, we're on 210 exactly.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.030
Wow. This is Bitcoin this year.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.400
And now it's time to go
check on the guy we trapped

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.233
in the circle.

00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:14.280
We're filming the hundred
day in circle video.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.710
And after talking really
loud, for a long time,

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.540
I'm very tired.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.010
So I'm gonna just take a nap, probably.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.010
So I did take a nap, in this guy's house,

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.360
and then we finished filming.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.380
Need anything else?

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.213
- No, I think I'm good.

00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:27.046
- See you in a week.

00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:27.879
- A week.

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.550
It's currently midnight, and
the boys asked if I wanted

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.383
to hang out.

00:05:30.383 --> 00:05:31.620
They're all just nomin' away.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.590
I'm not gonna lie, in this
moment I am contemplating

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.240
shaving my head so I can eat some nachos.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.073
Those look really good.

00:05:37.073 --> 00:05:37.982
- You can have them.

00:05:37.982 --> 00:05:40.963
(suspenseful background tune trilling)

00:05:40.963 --> 00:05:42.690
- All right, I'm sticking to my water.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.523
- Your loss.

00:05:43.523 --> 00:05:44.617
- [Videographer] Good
morning, Jim. How you doing?

00:05:44.617 --> 00:05:45.960
- I'm doing phenomenal,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.110
because it's officially been
a week since I ate food.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.660
And what better way to
celebrate this milestone

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.118
than some ice balls?

00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:54.665
(ice spheres clattering)

00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:55.498
(noisy ice crunching)

00:05:55.498 --> 00:05:58.320
Ow! This was a lot funnier
in my head after seven days

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.432
without food; cut me some slack.

00:06:00.432 --> 00:06:01.265
(ice cracking in sink)

00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:02.760
This next shot is brought
to you from the side,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.410
because Tareq didn't hit record.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.920
Oh my gosh, I'm down almost
12 pounds since we started

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.910
in only a week.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.440
Day seven was really busy.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.585
First, I did my vital check at the studio.

00:06:12.585 --> 00:06:13.679
(plastic packaging crackling)

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:15.570
- [Studio Worker] Bad, bad, no.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.250
- Who left these laying around?

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.180
I want it so bad.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.013
- [Studio Worker] Don't.

00:06:19.013 --> 00:06:19.846
- You eat it for me.

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:21.270
Let me just watch you eat this Oreo.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.138
This is sensational.

00:06:22.138 --> 00:06:23.040
(background audience groaning)

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.840
Then I checked out some in progress sets

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.950
from an upcoming video.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.930
And finally, me and Carl
filmed with Quackity

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:28.763
for the rest of the day.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:31.380
- Well, I don't understand how
this constitutes as a talent.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.790
- Mental toughness is a challenge.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:33.820
I have ate food in seven days.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.653
- What?

00:06:34.653 --> 00:06:36.120
- [Jimmy] This challenge
is definitely starting

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.470
to wear me down.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.475
So, um,...

00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:41.670
(distant vehicle engine roaring)

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.908
For one of our coming up videos we're...

00:06:42.908 --> 00:06:46.890
(diesel engine roaring)

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.723
Thank you, truck.

00:06:47.723 --> 00:06:48.870
What I was trying to say,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.940
is the chocolate factory
set was being built,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.050
and I wanted to show you.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.190
This is a chocolate fountain,

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.410
and that's how much chocolate
it requires to fill it.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.620
Bro, being around these candies
are making me so hungry.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.840
Why did we have to film
this during my fast?

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.370
The boys sent me a random DM saying,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.330
they're playing basketball.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.400
It's probably a horrible
idea, but screw it.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.500
I literally air balled my first shot.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.330
- [Nolan] He's definitely
a lot less energetic,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.470
making less shots.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.870
I didn't realize how weak
I was from not eating.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.594
But despite that, I still
managed to score a little.

00:07:15.594 --> 00:07:16.427
(Jimmy excited cheering)

00:07:16.427 --> 00:07:18.090
So funny story, I just pooped,

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.050
and that's significant,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.450
because this was my first
poop in over a week.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.530
So I did some Googling,

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.180
and apparently this is a normal thing.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.013
Not gonna lie,

00:07:25.013 --> 00:07:26.713
it, it feels so weird to poop again.

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:28.860
I was recording some videos
for the reaction channel,

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.610
and it really just, it drained me, man.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.200
- It's almost Jimmy James nap time.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.673
He is low on calories.

00:07:35.673 --> 00:07:37.170
- I'm, I'm low on the energies.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.210
I also just didn't sleep
that well last night,

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.590
but I can barely keep my eyes open.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.170
I'm on a couch in the studio,

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.373
and I'm literally just sleeping.

00:07:45.373 --> 00:07:47.040
(background windows
computer tonal chiming)

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.810
On day 10 I flew out to New York,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.010
to meet with Mark Rover.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.170
Me and mark are about the
talk on the stage in front

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.617
of a bunch of very important people.

00:07:53.617 --> 00:07:55.018
And I'm tired, and haven't ate food.

00:07:55.018 --> 00:07:56.907
- I didn't know was
scientifically possible

00:07:56.907 --> 00:07:58.530
to survive that long without food.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.720
- [Jimmy] But back home, the
boys had their own plans.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.710
- While Jimmy's in New York,

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.120
Tareq let us into his house,

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.830
and we've been filling
it with food all day.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:05.730
- I've been eating all day.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.690
- Stop. - Okay.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.771
- [Mark] We removed
thirty-two and a half billion

00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:09.604
pounds of trash.

00:08:09.604 --> 00:08:10.780
(frame glass shattering)

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.621
(hammer loud tacking)

00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:14.308
Brings us step closer to a cleaner world.

00:08:14.308 --> 00:08:16.176
- Oh! - What? Stop!
You're making it splosh.

00:08:16.176 --> 00:08:17.945
- [Jimmy] I recently
launched a chocolate brand,

00:08:17.945 --> 00:08:19.951
and I thought it would be
fun to give you guys all some

00:08:19.951 --> 00:08:20.981
chocolate bars.

00:08:20.981 --> 00:08:22.519
(show audience cheering)

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:24.725
(background rock tune riffing)

00:08:24.725 --> 00:08:25.805
- The talk went great,

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:27.364
and now I'm exhausted.

00:08:27.364 --> 00:08:28.197
I'm going to bed.

00:08:28.197 --> 00:08:30.270
- When Jimmy gets back
from New York, guys,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.510
he's not gonna know what
hit him, but it was us.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.560
He's definitely gonna eat,

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.850
and then we get to shave his head.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:36.740
- Team Us!

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.573
(hands slapping)

00:08:37.573 --> 00:08:38.406
(slow background melody chiming)

00:08:38.406 --> 00:08:39.600
- [Jimmy] Hello?

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.920
- [Tareq] Hey, Jim.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.540
Hey, listen, I can explain.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.440
Were you in on this?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.970
- [Tareq] I filmed it.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.620
- Oh, it smells so good in here.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.420
Please tell me it was just down here?

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.380
My bed?

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.213
Bro!

00:08:50.213 --> 00:08:52.020
How badly do they wanna shave my head?

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.310
I'm FaceTiming Chandler.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.143
What is this?

00:08:54.143 --> 00:08:54.976
- Ya hungry?

00:08:54.976 --> 00:08:55.830
- Yes, actually.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.570
My stomach pain went
away for the most part,

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.403
but now it's throbbing.

00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:00.348
- [Chandler] Did you check
under the toilet seats?

00:09:00.348 --> 00:09:01.403
(background techno tune blaring)

00:09:01.403 --> 00:09:03.870
- No, and because you said
that I'm not going to now.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.280
- I'm in a chocolate factory,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.120
watching people eat chocolate.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.460
And it's been 12 days since I ate food.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.480
Thirteen, twelve?

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.313
I don't even know what day.

00:09:10.313 --> 00:09:12.270
And the day only got worse from there.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.190
I was so nauseous that I couldn't film for

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.830
more than 20 minutes without
sitting down for a break.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.090
Oh my God, I'm gonna throw up.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.560
At one point, I almost scrapped the

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.210
chocolate factory video,
because I was so low energy.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.563
- [Videographer] You want
to sit down for a second?

00:09:25.993 --> 00:09:27.930
(Jimmy fatigued groaning)

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.540
And by the end of the day, I
felt like I was gonna pass out.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.090
So we headed to check with the doctor.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.028
(background show tune blaring)

00:09:33.028 --> 00:09:34.320
I'm getting pretty low on energy.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.400
So I'm gonna talk to the doctor,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.270
and see what we should do.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.410
- I think we should shave your head.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.460
And then you can eat, and
then you'll feel better.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.620
- True, it is actually
kind of tempting right now.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.700
I really am hungry.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.380
- Your hormone levels came back,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.164
and it shows you are
doing good with your fast.

00:09:45.164 --> 00:09:46.080
- I believe you.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.970
I saw you sleep eight times today.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.800
- It's definitely starting
to catch up to me.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.240
- Your electrolytes still look good,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.190
but I'm a little bit concerned
about your energy level.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.120
When you start to feel worse,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.617
we can always break the fast for your...

00:09:55.617 --> 00:09:56.450
- Uhhh... - safety.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.100
- Yeah, we can break the
hair off of your head too.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.050
- And this is why you
need medical supervision

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.310
when you do these long fast.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.210
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.350
I'm listening to him.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.183
- [Videographer] Good night, man.

00:10:05.183 --> 00:10:06.705
We'll see you on chocolate
factory tomorrow.

00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:08.410
(Jimmy groggy muttering)

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:09.810
(ambient background melody chiming)

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.430
- [Jimmy] I had to fly out on day 13,

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.840
so I weighed myself from home.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.110
That's 18 pounds under where
I started in just two weeks.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.790
We're heading to Vegas
to film a quick clip

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.660
with Gordon Ramsey.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.617
All this flying's really
start to catch up with me.

00:10:20.617 --> 00:10:22.254
- [Flight Attendant] Would
you like some peanuts?

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:23.479
- Uh, no.

00:10:23.479 --> 00:10:24.870
I would not like peanuts.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.190
50 minutes past midnight,

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.230
so it's actually officially day 14.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.500
It has been two weeks,
since I last day food,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.930
our hotel room had a
bunch of snacks in it,

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.030
and Nolan won't stop
eating them in front of me.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.710
- All I know how to do is eat chips.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.720
- Tomorrow we're gonna be
cooking food for Gordon Ramsey,

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.220
or today cause it's 1:00 AM.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.200
I'm hungry; I'm going to bed.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.520
While filming with Gordon Ramsey,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.900
I was trying to stay upbeat,

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.790
but I was really dying on the inside.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.040
We just filmed with Gordon
Ramsey from one of our videos.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.960
He has informed me, he
wants to cook me something

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.793
for his channel.

00:10:52.793 --> 00:10:53.678
- But you can't eat.

00:10:53.678 --> 00:10:54.511
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:56.820
As far as YouTube channel,
Carl can taste test for me.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.080
You know, it's how he's
one of the greatest chefs

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.210
to ever live, and by not
eating it I'd be passing up

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.050
a golden opportunity.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.000
- Welcome to Scrambled, where
I'm cooking my favorite dish,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.833
scrambled eggs.

00:11:03.833 --> 00:11:04.666
With some close friends,

00:11:04.666 --> 00:11:06.120
and today please welcome Mr. Beast.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.953
- Thank you.

00:11:06.953 --> 00:11:07.786
(hands clasping)

00:11:07.786 --> 00:11:08.619
What a great hype, man.

00:11:08.619 --> 00:11:10.260
I have to also say I'm doing
a video where I try not

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.430
to eat food for 30 days.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.780
And if I do, I have to shave my head.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.580
I'm gonna try not to eat what he makes.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.690
I'm gonna make a sandwich,

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.770
and you're telling me now you're not gonna

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:17.603
(background record scratching)

00:11:17.603 --> 00:11:18.436
eat it?

00:11:18.436 --> 00:11:19.269
- It depends, unless it looks really good.

00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:20.880
Uh oh, I pissed Gordon Ramsay off.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.380
- Just take a little bite, right?

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.580
How do you fast for 30 days?

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.890
- Well, I'm not a doctor, so
I don't want to tell you how.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.030
- When was the last time you had a poo?

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.336
- Uhh, oh God.

00:11:28.336 --> 00:11:29.220
(men chuckling)

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.090
That does sound smell good.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:30.923
- It's somehow...

00:11:30.923 --> 00:11:31.800
- You're gonna make me cry.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.270
- [Gordon] These are so special.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.200
- Holy crap.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.370
- They're beautiful.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.203
- Oh my gosh.

00:11:36.203 --> 00:11:37.036
- Breakfast sandwich...

00:11:37.036 --> 00:11:37.869
Young man, come here.

00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:38.702
At least take a bite.

00:11:38.702 --> 00:11:40.680
You'll be the first person
in my entire career,

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.240
that I've cooked something
from start to finish...

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.430
If he's... Please,...

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.335
Just...

00:11:45.335 --> 00:11:46.168
(Gordon chuckling)

00:11:46.168 --> 00:11:48.150
- All right, I'll take one bite.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.410
And I have to spit it out technically,

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.610
cause the refeeding syndrome,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.020
but I still want to just taste it.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.070
- So, you're breaking the fast?

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.043
- I'm gonna break the fast.

00:11:54.043 --> 00:11:54.876
(background ethereal chiming)

00:11:54.876 --> 00:11:59.229
- [Gordon] It's supposed to
be sloppy, rich, delicious...

00:11:59.229 --> 00:12:00.333
- [Jimmy] I love it, I love it.

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:02.970
It's the best thing I've ever tasted...

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:03.803
in my life.

00:12:03.803 --> 00:12:05.250
But you can't just have an influx of carbs

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.450
after not eating 14 days.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.283
- Happy with that?

00:12:07.283 --> 00:12:08.368
- I am, very happy.

00:12:08.368 --> 00:12:09.201
Thank you.

00:12:09.201 --> 00:12:10.034
(hands smacking)

00:12:10.034 --> 00:12:10.867
- Right!

00:12:10.867 --> 00:12:11.700
- I feel energized just having that in me.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.533
Bro, after fourteen days...

00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:14.076
There you have it, this jerk...

00:12:14.076 --> 00:12:14.909
(Gordon chuckling)

00:12:14.909 --> 00:12:15.742
is gonna make me shave my head.

00:12:15.742 --> 00:12:16.575
Let's go do it.

00:12:16.575 --> 00:12:17.408
A deal is a deal.

00:12:17.408 --> 00:12:18.750
Chris, you can shave my head.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.040
- Why do we have so many razors?

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.873
- I hate you, Gordon!

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:21.706
- I love you, Gordon. Thank you.

00:12:21.706 --> 00:12:23.070
You ready? - Go for it.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.230
I'm scared I'm going to mess
up, but I literally can't...

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.850
- Oh, lovely, lovely.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:27.683
- Oh!

00:12:27.683 --> 00:12:28.516
- That feels oddly good.

00:12:28.516 --> 00:12:30.390
Tareq's just behind the camera like...

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.249
- Here let me...

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:32.082
- Just get it over with!

00:12:32.082 --> 00:12:33.690
- I'm gonna leave you a little unicorn.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.546
- Gosh.

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:35.880
(electric razor buzzing)

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.190
- Oh my God, that was so much hair.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.023
- Oh, okay.

00:12:39.023 --> 00:12:40.440
Okay, just let me see
that side real quick.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.390
Look how thin the side of my head is.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.470
I, all right, you know what?

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.790
I'm ending the video here.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.200
I didn't trust Chris
with the razor anymore,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.450
so this is my barber finishing up.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.860
And this is the only
time you're gonna see me

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.733
like this.

00:12:50.733 --> 00:12:53.010
For the next five months,
I'm gonna be wearing a hat.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:53.843
Goodbye!

00:12:53.843 --> 00:12:58.226
(background singer soulful vocalizing)

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.451
- You won't be needing these anymore.

00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:02.940
(plate clattering)

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.903
It's a good plate.
