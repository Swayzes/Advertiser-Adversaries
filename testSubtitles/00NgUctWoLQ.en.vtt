00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:03.360
(techno music)

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.190
- This is the largest stadium in the world

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.280
and inside are the 10
biggest creators on YouTube.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.544
This is $1 million and
whichever one of them

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.341
I find last keeps it!

00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:13.174
(crew cheers)

00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:14.520
I'm gonna count to a hundred.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.353
Go hide.

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:16.290
(crew cheers)

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.123
- See later, everybody.

00:00:17.123 --> 00:00:18.450
Three.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.805
- Okay, This is for a million dollars

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:21.638
- Six.

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:23.040
Hey, Mark, good luck!

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.030
- Thank you!

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.863
- [Jimmy] This stadium

00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:26.340
can hold a hundred thousand people

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.590
and has a million places to hide.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.630
- 51, 52.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.950
Do I really have to count to a hundred?

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.990
- We need more time, Jimmy.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.727
- Three, two, one.

00:00:36.727 --> 00:00:38.940
$1 million for your fans.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.810
Good luck.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.000
In my previous video, I
invited a bunch of YouTubers

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.470
that had a bunch of crazy challenges.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.800
The 10 people competing
here were the winners

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.780
of those challenges.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.685
So let's go left.

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:48.154
- They are not finding me.

00:00:48.154 --> 00:00:49.504
- I haven't run this much since P.E.

00:00:49.504 --> 00:00:50.337
- [Boy] Okay.

00:00:50.337 --> 00:00:52.920
(upbeat music)

00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:57.330
- I'm gonna go that way.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.163
You go that way.

00:00:58.163 --> 00:00:59.091
- Okay

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:00.270
- I have the perfect hiding place.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.800
- They give us no time to hide.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.540
- We scaled up an eight-foot wall.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.767
Jimmy, you can come find me.

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:08.400
- Come out, come out where you are.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.233
- Trust me.

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:10.066
There's somebody over here.

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.002
I'm gonna find you.

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:12.372
Give it a rest.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:15.122
(Jimmy knocking)

00:01:16.457 --> 00:01:17.670
Do you smell that?

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.627
- If they're in here, they want it.

00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:19.770
But this smells so bad.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.780
- So am in a trash can right now.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.613
Oh, my God.

00:01:22.613 --> 00:01:23.446
This is disgusting.

00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:25.140
Jimmy, I've been looking
for like a year, I think

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.490
and I still haven't found anybody.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.980
- Why do I keep picking
giant places for this stuff?

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.770
We did three laps at the
stadium and found nothing.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.630
I feel like this game could take forever

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.880
but sometimes you can get lucky.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.950
Steps to the perfect hiding spot.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.402
Pop open the top, climb in.

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:40.920
(dramatic music)

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.900
It is the perfect hiding spot.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.733
Perfect.

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:47.250
And while Mat Pat was climbing
in a trashcan, we got him.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.110
You're not some trash worker.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.010
- No!

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.876
Trash worker.

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:52.590
- Yes, I found someone!

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.240
Attention, everybody!

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.980
Mat Pat is officially out!

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.193
- Look at my shame.

00:01:57.193 --> 00:01:58.414
- No, not Mat!

00:01:58.414 --> 00:01:59.247
- Dang it!

00:01:59.247 --> 00:02:00.080
I was rooting for him.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.470
- No joke, I was like 40 feet away

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.040
from the cleaner when you found me.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.990
(Jimmy screams)

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.600
- I searched a hundred more
rooms and found nobody.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.880
I literally have no idea
where they're hiding.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.590
- Jimmy, there are cars in the building.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.360
There may be somebody hiding in there.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.200
- You're right.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.400
Let's see if someone's in here.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.493
- No way.

00:02:15.493 --> 00:02:16.350
(dramatic sting)

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.320
I almost hit the door. (laughs)

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.010
- (hisses) I barricaded myself

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.350
in stacks of various beverages.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.493
- My butt is wet right now.

00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:25.380
I'm pretty sure I'm out
here sitting in throw up.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.322
I'm gonna win this.

00:02:26.322 --> 00:02:27.211
Mark my words.

00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:28.566
(piano music)

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:29.937
- This is gonna take forever.

00:02:29.937 --> 00:02:32.310
I'm really struggling to find them.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.160
So I invited the five people
that lost in the last video

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.120
to help me seek.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.380
The objective is simple.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.779
We rip a million dollars
outta someone's hand.

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:40.710
- Yeah!

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.340
- I love the energy

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.310
- All five coming after us.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.270
I'm scared.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.103
- You check that cabinet.

00:02:46.103 --> 00:02:47.382
I check this cabinet.

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:48.215
- One, two, three.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.930
- I'm not leaving this place
until somebody gets found.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.980
- Oh, I hear them.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.330
- We gotta get to the first floor, guys.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.590
- First floor, first floor.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.169
Where else can we check that
we have not checked so far?

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.969
(dramatic music)

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.014
- It's very hot in here.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:01.847
It's very dark.

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:02.880
- [Boy] I don't think
there's anybody in there.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.713
- You don't think so.

00:03:03.713 --> 00:03:05.040
- There's nobody in there.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.890
- I'm feeling it.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.223
- Wow!

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.552
- I would honestly say outside.

00:03:13.552 --> 00:03:16.302
(dramatic music)

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:22.614
- Zach!

00:03:22.614 --> 00:03:24.413
- [Girl] Oh, my God!

00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:25.920
Oh, my!

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.753
- [Boy On Walkie Talkie] I found ZHC.

00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:28.289
- Looks like we found somebody.

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:29.122
- I'm so sorry.

00:03:29.122 --> 00:03:30.300
- No, I'm so sorry.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.710
- Meet me at the field, pronto.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.098
But before I could go on
the field to eliminate ZHC,

00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:36.680
Carl and Nolan noticed
something interesting.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.700
- What is this worker working on?

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.020
He's just moving the cart and forth.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.070
- [Nolan] He's doing worker things.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.320
- Just looked a little bit suspicious.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.160
Jimmy, I found somebody.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.240
But he doesn't know that I saw him.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.080
- Who is it?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.390
- So I'm hiding in this basket thing.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.440
People won't think to check it

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.954
'cause it's like, "Oh it's like a worker."

00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:52.214
Big brain move, baby.

00:03:52.214 --> 00:03:53.160
(dramatic music)

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.860
- Carl kept guarding the
very suspicious cart.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.930
Let's see if his hunch was right.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.443
- How much are they paying
you to push them around?

00:03:59.443 --> 00:04:01.020
- He gave me 500.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.130
- I'll give you a thousand dollars.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.880
(dramatic music)

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.080
We're gonna push him to the field.

00:04:13.013 --> 00:04:14.030
- It's not fair.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.151
I thought I had it.

00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:17.652
You'll ever take me alive!

00:04:17.652 --> 00:04:20.069
(guys laugh)

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.650
- And I brought you on the field

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.030
because that's where the prison is.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.334
Follow me.

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:27.073
- Aww!

00:04:27.073 --> 00:04:27.906
- Reason I caught on is

00:04:27.906 --> 00:04:29.730
'cause he literally
just kept taking plastic

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.998
and then putting it back on the
cart and then taking it off.

00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:33.660
Look, NPC.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.940
- We found Mark, Rover and ZHC.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.012
Only seven of you remain!

00:04:38.012 --> 00:04:39.154
- Only seven more left.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:40.133
(Logan breathes heavily)

00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:42.717
- Maybe I do need my mom
right now because I am scared.

00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:44.610
- And to celebrate
getting three people out,

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.650
we're officially shutting
off the sixth floor.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.080
I'll give you like 10 minutes to move

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.920
if you're on that floor.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.780
- Jimmy just told us to move floors.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.790
I was super comfortable and that sucks.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.297
- You want me down a floor.

00:04:55.297 --> 00:04:56.946
(upbeat music)

00:04:56.946 --> 00:04:58.971
(door creaks)

00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:00.377
(Larray panting)

00:05:00.377 --> 00:05:02.740
- You guys wanna subscribe (indistinct)?

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.573
Make sure you subscribe.

00:05:03.573 --> 00:05:04.710
(soft music)

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.700
- Just to confirm,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.228
you are all off the
sixth floor now, correct?

00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:09.952
(walkie talkie buzzes)

00:05:09.952 --> 00:05:11.391
- I think I found a great spot. (blowing)

00:05:11.391 --> 00:05:12.806
I think I'm good.

00:05:12.806 --> 00:05:13.639
- Shh!

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:14.472
- [Man] Shh!

00:05:14.472 --> 00:05:15.417
- Shh!

00:05:15.417 --> 00:05:16.717
- All right, so I'm gonna freeze.

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:18.946
- I really don't know how
much longer I can stay in here

00:05:18.946 --> 00:05:21.057
because it smells so bad.

00:05:21.057 --> 00:05:22.500
- I'm a bush.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.840
- Even with Zach branching
out his hiding skills,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.220
we were getting closer.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.497
Well if this isn't a
suspicious room. (laughs)

00:05:29.497 --> 00:05:33.270
Okay, if I were them I
would create a blockade

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.594
using these guys to distract away from...

00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:37.560
(dramatic music)

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.180
Ah, the mop closet!

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.013
Darn it!

00:05:40.013 --> 00:05:41.611
I thought for sure.

00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:43.331
- There's so many to choose from.

00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:45.573
(dramatic music)

00:05:45.573 --> 00:05:48.156
(Logan laughs)

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:51.929
- Oh, my God, my allergies.

00:05:54.664 --> 00:05:57.670
(Larray sneezes)

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.073
- Wait, go see who that was.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.283
- Oh, my God.

00:06:01.283 --> 00:06:04.050
- Despite not finding
anyone, Air Rac got lucky.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.053
- I 100% just saw a
face in this trash can.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.880
Okay, is this a person?

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.650
- [Jimmy] Oh, my gosh!

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.016
That is a real person.

00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:12.849
- Oh!

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.070
- [Jimmy] Oh no.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.484
You've been in this box
for like five hours.

00:06:16.484 --> 00:06:17.317
- I thought it was worth it

00:06:17.317 --> 00:06:19.653
'cause I'd win the money,
but now it's not worth it.

00:06:19.653 --> 00:06:20.486
(Jimmy laughs)

00:06:20.486 --> 00:06:21.319
- All right, everybody.

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:22.647
We officially have our fourth person out.

00:06:22.647 --> 00:06:24.390
She was hiding in a trash can

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.380
just like Mat Pat.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.180
I'd advise you stop hiding in trash cans.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.080
They don't work.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.550
Because of Mat Pat and Sofie,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.370
I could never trust a trash can again.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.203
No one.

00:06:33.203 --> 00:06:34.323
Can I inspect these bags?

00:06:34.323 --> 00:06:35.995
(upbeat music)

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:36.828
Okay.

00:06:36.828 --> 00:06:37.710
You're good to do your job.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.060
Because Rosanna's still in,

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.610
I even have to check things
like this little trashcan.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.780
She could fit in anything.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.780
Like if I were a tiny Rosanna
Pansino, where would I hide?

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.943
Boom!

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.260
If I were a tiny Rosanna
Pansino where would I...

00:06:59.228 --> 00:07:00.061
Hide!

00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:00.894
(dramatic sting)

00:07:00.894 --> 00:07:03.774
Ah, I thought I had her for sure.

00:07:03.774 --> 00:07:05.790
(upbeat music)

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.454
For sure!

00:07:07.454 --> 00:07:08.640
(upbeat music)

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.250
It had been another two
hours since we found anyone

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.560
and I was tempted to make
the circle smaller again.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.420
But right before I could do that,

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.340
I stumbled across one more person.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.680
If I were to hide anywhere,
it would be this room.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.000
Wait a minute.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.340
Is that some sneakers I see right there?

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.600
I'm gonna guess it's Logan.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.030
This feels like some Logan stuff.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.220
Oh Bella, how long have you been here?

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.600
Sorry it didn't work out, Bella.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.760
You didn't manage to win this
million dollars for your fans.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.593
- I tried.

00:07:33.593 --> 00:07:34.650
- I'm gonna go find more people.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.870
Attention, five remaining contestants,

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.190
Bella has been found.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.620
I'm shrinking the playing
field down to the first floor.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.660
This is where things get serious.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.063
- We're having to move floors.

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:44.896
Fine.

00:07:45.963 --> 00:07:47.651
Okay, we're moving.

00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:50.151
(rapid music)

00:07:52.784 --> 00:07:54.063
(car engine humming)

00:07:54.063 --> 00:07:55.354
- They've gotta be moving.

00:07:55.354 --> 00:07:57.962
(rapid music)

00:07:57.962 --> 00:07:59.725
Wait, what's that?
(guys speak indistinctly)

00:07:59.725 --> 00:08:00.558
Wait, what's that?

00:08:00.558 --> 00:08:01.391
Wave!

00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:02.224
Point your camera!

00:08:02.224 --> 00:08:03.072
(guys speak indistinctly)

00:08:03.072 --> 00:08:03.910
Oh!

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.956
Oh, no!

00:08:04.956 --> 00:08:09.928
Raz, you're not fooling
anyone with those big pants.

00:08:09.928 --> 00:08:14.035
- I don't know what I'm
doing out here by myself.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.535
(rapid music)

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.203
- Quackity!

00:08:22.203 --> 00:08:23.036
(Quackity laughs)

00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:24.344
We got him!

00:08:24.344 --> 00:08:25.177
Yes!

00:08:25.177 --> 00:08:27.660
(rapid music)

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.330
- I saw you walking through
the windows right there.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.163
- [Quackity] You just robbed me

00:08:31.163 --> 00:08:32.250
of a million dollars, man.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.351
- Come on, don't say that, Quack.

00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:34.260
(soft music)

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.400
Look at that million dollars.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.810
Yeah, you can wave goodbye to it.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.550
With seven people now eliminated,

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.320
we are down to the final three.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.703
- Massive stadium, but there's
not a lot of spots to hide.

00:08:42.703 --> 00:08:44.550
- I literally showed up
here at 6:00 in the morning

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.150
pushing through with zero sleep.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.280
- We are going head to
head and hide and seek

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.380
for a million dollars
for one of your fans.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.720
You guys are currently
hiding on the first row.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.920
This shouldn't take that long.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.360
This is gonna be intense.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.193
We're coming for you.

00:08:58.193 --> 00:09:00.000
- Good thing I'm on the first.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.264
- I'm so sleepy.

00:09:01.264 --> 00:09:04.014
(dramatic music)

00:09:05.394 --> 00:09:06.227
- Oh, frig, that hurts.

00:09:06.227 --> 00:09:08.977
(dramatic music)

00:09:19.034 --> 00:09:20.873
So I am up here.

00:09:20.873 --> 00:09:22.980
Okay, I feel good about this spot.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.890
- With Zach, Larray and Logan
and only one floor left,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.930
there's nowhere for them to hide forever.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.540
We're able to scour
every inch of this place

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.133
including the trash cans.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.910
It's just a matter of time.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.688
The real race is who will we find first?

00:09:38.688 --> 00:09:39.720
- I think I left a little trace though.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.700
You can see these black dots I dropped.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.630
I don't like that.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.310
- It's freezing in this freezer.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.810
Go figure

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.513
- [Jimmy] There's some spots in here.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.160
- Again, I hear everybody coming.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.660
- I think one of them's in the ceiling.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.970
Weird insulation on the countertop here.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.430
Weird giant hand print, U print.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.263
- [Girl] You think people are here?

00:10:00.263 --> 00:10:01.096
- Yeah, let's look.

00:10:01.096 --> 00:10:03.685
(dramatic music)

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.723
- It's 32 degrees in this
fridge and I'm in shorts.

00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:15.030
- [Girl] He's not here, Mat!

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.490
I feel like he might have
been, but he gone now.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:18.540
- I'm like a hunter.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.327
I'm a hunter sniffing the scent.

00:10:20.327 --> 00:10:23.077
(dramatic music)

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.104
- This is ridiculous.

00:10:33.104 --> 00:10:35.094
(dramatic music)

00:10:35.094 --> 00:10:35.927
- [Logan] No one believed
me when I set the scenes.

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:38.677
(dramatic music)

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.137
- Oh, there he is.

00:10:43.137 --> 00:10:46.110
- [Jimmy] Turns out the
freezer was too much for Logan

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.370
and we heard him get out

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.694
and we literally found him
one minute before Zach.

00:10:50.694 --> 00:10:51.527
(upbeat music)

00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:54.047
Ah, got him!

00:10:54.047 --> 00:10:55.745
- No!
- Yes, yes!

00:10:55.745 --> 00:10:56.578
I knew it!

00:10:56.578 --> 00:10:57.832
I had your numbers on!
(Zach screaming)

00:10:57.832 --> 00:10:58.665
Whoo!

00:10:58.665 --> 00:11:01.020
He was in the ceiling!

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.730
But here's where gets interesting.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.676
Does this mean Larray won?

00:11:04.676 --> 00:11:05.509
(Larray exhales)

00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:08.937
About that, Larray actually
fell asleep while hiding.

00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:09.770
(Larry snores)

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.330
We searched the entire first
floor and kept calling him.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.790
We genuinely thought
he was a hiding master,

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.560
but it turns out he was napping

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.300
on the second floor of the entire time.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.627
- And I literally just woke up.

00:11:19.627 --> 00:11:20.634
I don't know what to do.

00:11:20.634 --> 00:11:21.660
I don't know what's the rules.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.800
- [Jamie] While dazed and confused,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.230
we eventually found him
coming down to the first floor

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.430
- Here I am.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.230
- It also shows that
part of the skill of this

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.430
is not falling asleep

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.080
which is actually kind of funny. (laughs)

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.240
And because Larray was
outside the playing field,

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.456
we unfortunately had to disqualify him,

00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:36.289
(soft music)

00:11:36.289 --> 00:11:38.820
which means by technicality,
but well earned,

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.080
there is a winner.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.100
- Wait, say it again.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.000
- [Jimmy] You won.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.833
That's for real?

00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:43.666
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:44.601
- Are you--

00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:45.718
(audience cheers)

00:11:45.718 --> 00:11:47.100
- This is the million dollars

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.798
you just won right here.
(audience cheers)

00:11:48.798 --> 00:11:50.130
- We won!
- This is the winner up here,

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:50.963
game three!

00:11:50.963 --> 00:11:51.796
- What are you gonna give this to?

00:11:51.796 --> 00:11:54.150
I will do Mr. B Style Giveaways of course,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.800
put it towards foster care

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.910
and filmmaking ventures--
- Aw!

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:57.743
- that I'm into for--

00:11:57.743 --> 00:11:58.800
- What a nice guy.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.633
Thank you for watching.
