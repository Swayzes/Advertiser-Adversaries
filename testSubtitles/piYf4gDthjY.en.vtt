00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.060
- All right, so this is an iPhone 15

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.410
and a 15 Plus and a 15
Pro and a 15 Pro Max,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.760
every new phone in the lineup.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.730
New colors, new materials, new ports.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.170
There's some good stuff to unbox here,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.790
so let's do it.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.370
So starting with iPhone 15 and 15 Plus.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.370
This iPhone 15 here is the
new blue color, and it is,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.453
I'm just gonna go ahead

00:00:23.453 --> 00:00:25.680
and rename this color to barely blue.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.820
I think that's an appropriate name,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.270
because it really is barely
giving hints of blue.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.430
You can really see it
on the side rails too.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.090
But yeah, really subtle colors
across the board this year.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.400
Anyway, the other things in
the box are the paperwork,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.560
the single white Apple sticker,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.600
and there is no SIM card ejector tool here

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.910
since they're all eSIM,
at least in the US now.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.310
But most importantly, the
new cable in the iPhone box

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.140
for all new iPhones

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.670
is a single, white, braided
USB-C to USB-C cable.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.870
I think this is the first time the iPhone

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.420
is shipping with a braided
nice cable like this.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.040
So hopefully it'll be a higher quality

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.960
and more durable than old cables

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.280
we've been getting for years.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.190
So, cool, USB-C cable, USB-C phone.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.930
Now, if we take a look at the Plus,

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.460
same idea, bigger box,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.460
but this new incredibly pale yellow.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.460
I mean, again, in perfect
lighting at the Apple event

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.930
I think it looked a
little bit more colorful,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.450
but it just looks extremely pale out here.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.720
And then we've got the Pro boxes
for the Pro phones as well.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.210
Still white boxes, but dark wallpapers.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.470
So the iPhone 15 Pro I have
here is the new dark blue color.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.960
I almost want to call this
one barely blue again,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.310
but this time it's darker

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.750
and kind of borders on gray

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.310
when the light hits it
from certain angles.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.143
Very safe.

00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:37.650
Same stuff in the box after that though,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.630
the paperwork, the white Apple sticker,

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.940
and the new braided USB-C cable.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.130
And then our iPhone 15 Pro Max here

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.830
is the new Natural Titanium color.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.900
And I gotta say, guys,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.180
I think this is gonna be the one to get.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.880
It's the best color in person in the hand.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.140
I'll talk more about why in a minute,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.640
but there you have it.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.490
The slightly new unboxing experience

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.890
on iPhone 15s and 15 Pros.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.090
So by the time you see this,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.110
I've been testing these
phones for about six days now.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.450
Not quite enough time for
a review by my standards,

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.380
but still plenty of time

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.910
to give you some interesting thoughts,

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.430
some things that I've picked
up on, and some quirks.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.710
So first of all, these pale colors.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.820
I don't really know how else to say it.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.650
Like, this might be totally fine with you.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.483
I always get told

00:02:20.483 --> 00:02:21.900
everyone's gonna put
a case on their phone,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.160
which they probably are.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.110
But hey, Apple did spend
a ton of time and money

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.500
making this new softer touch
satin finish on the back,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.460
and some of us,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.550
some of us will carry our
phones around with no case,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.350
so it's worth mentioning.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.340
For the Pro phones

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.560
there's actually an extra
layer of interesting though,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.690
because they've switched
that rail material,

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.520
the part that you actually
touch on the outside,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.450
from shiny stainless
steel to brushed titanium.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.460
We've all heard about
how much lighter it is,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.230
and it's something like 10% lighter,

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.090
which is enough for me
to notice and enjoy.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.340
But the other thing is I
thought the brushed finish

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.620
would sort of eliminate
fingerprints on the sides.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.453
Absolutely not.

00:02:56.453 --> 00:02:57.630
I was wrong about that.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.463
I mean, it's less,

00:02:58.463 --> 00:02:59.820
it's not as bad as stainless steel,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.440
but especially on these darker colors

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.780
like the black or this blue,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.430
you can totally see fingerprints

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.560
and sort of where your hand oils

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.780
are marking up the sides of the phone.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.860
And then on top of that,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.200
this is not anodized
like aluminum might be.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.870
This is the new PVD coating
they talked about on stage.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.640
And it's only been a week here for me,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.260
and so I don't know exactly how well

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.580
this will hold up over time,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.220
but what I do know is if you get a scratch

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.710
deep enough into this coating,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.380
it's gotta be the Natural
Titanium color underneath,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.850
which is very light.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.900
And so that might look rough,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.820
if you drop this phone with no case

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.730
and get like a big gash
on your dark colored phone

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.290
and have light marks all over it.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.430
All of that to say,

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.360
I do really think that this
Natural Titanium or the light

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.810
is gonna be the better color
to get on the Pros this year.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.820
Okay, some things I've
noticed in my first week.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.350
So first of all, on the Pro,

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.360
the bezels are technically
a little bit thinner,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.400
which makes the body a little smaller,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.770
but you really don't notice
that much after a few minutes.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.870
What you do notice more actually visually

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.640
is the slightly softer curves

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.840
all the way around these phones,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.700
seriously, on the 15 and 15 Pro.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.190
Because on the 14 it was so square,

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.100
like it just went straight to
the edge with a flat display

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.680
and then it dropped right
into the rail at 90 degrees.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.670
On these new phones,

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.140
the edge of the front glass

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.690
actually has a little bit
of curve at the very edges,

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.820
so it's a softer curve into the rail.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.010
Then the rail itself has softer curves

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.530
than the totally sharp
corners from last year.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.730
So I think it's a nice hybrid

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.440
of making it just more comfortable

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.520
in the hand with these curves,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.770
but still keeping the generally boxy look.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.480
Now, with USB-C on these phones,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.940
we already learned that you
can just plug in a cable

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.560
to charge an accessory, right?

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.810
So it's no reverse wireless charging,

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.910
but you can at least plug in a USB-C cable

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.890
straight to AirPods

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.870
or an Apple Watch MagSafe
charger, whatever,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.970
and it will charge from
your phone's battery.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.650
So that's already pretty interesting,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.300
but I decided it's worth learning

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.890
all the rules and behaviors

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.620
of plugging things into the iPhone 15s.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.453
So here they are.

00:04:53.453 --> 00:04:57.000
So if you plug in any
older Lightning iPhone

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.470
into a USB-C iPhone,

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.030
regardless of the charge state,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.000
the USB-C iPhone will always give battery

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.380
to the Lightning iPhone,

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.780
every single time no matter what.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.510
Now, if you plug in another USB-C iPhone

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.550
into your USB-C iPhone,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.890
it actually does a handshake
where they talk to each other,

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.260
figure out which one
has the lower battery,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.517
and then the one with the
higher state of charge goes,

00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:20.010
"All right, I'm a battery bank,

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.600
and I will start charging the one

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.040
with the lower stated of charge,"

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.330
all the way till you unplug it.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.560
So I thought that was pretty interesting

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.760
and it works pretty well.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.940
Then I decided to try a
couple of Android phones

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.130
and see if the same handshake happened.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.360
Basically what we found

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.000
is if you plug into your
friend's Android phone

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.560
who has more battery than you

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.840
and that phone has USB PD,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.880
it will actually act like a battery bank.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.980
But if the phone doesn't have USB PD,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.350
which is a bunch actually right now,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.400
it's pretty inconsistent

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.630
and you could end up charging it

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.370
or it could end up charging you.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.320
Literally unplug and try it again.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.480
But if it has USB Power Delivery,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.910
it will actually do the same
handshake that the iPhones do.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.530
It's only 4 1/2 watts out,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.430
so it's not huge.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.110
It's not gonna fast charge or anything.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.330
But, you know, it is
ideal for accessories.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.130
You can literally use the cable in the box

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.320
to charge up the new AirPods

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.880
or whatever else you wanna try.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.090
But yeah, you can rescue
another smartphone in a pinch.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.330
So then the new Action button on the Pros.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.530
I was very curious about this.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.900
I was not sure if it would
have some restrictions

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.390
or if there's some things
that it wouldn't let you do,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.140
and it turns out I haven't
been able to find any so far.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.420
It seems like it basically
lets you do anything you want,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.800
and I'm very happy about that.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.910
I mean, this was a feature

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.890
of a lot of Android phones in the past.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.600
There were some LG phones that did this,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.390
some Sony phones, I wanna
say some ASUS phones.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.310
I'm hoping it starts to make
a bit of a comeback here,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.220
because on this new iPhone it is great.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.570
So you jump into the settings

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.310
and go to Action button,

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.560
and it loads up this whole crazy UI

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.500
that's just nothing like any
of the other settings pages

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.333
on the iPhone,

00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:53.400
like they just stapled
this in here, but okay.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.110
And as I showed you in
the impressions video,

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.950
you can do any number

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.960
of pre-programmed things with this button.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.020
By default, it is still the
mute switch that it replaces,

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.060
and it has those two
different haptic patterns.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.560
So when you mute it in your pocket,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.730
you know exactly what you're doing

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.620
without even checking
you did it correctly.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.790
But honestly, I don't know.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.950
I leave my phone on mute
most of the time anyway.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.170
So you can also have it open up the camera

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.490
in any of the camera modes.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.230
But then again, the camera shortcut

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.880
is, like, right on your
lock screen already,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.470
and I'm pretty used to that.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.580
Same thing with the flashlight.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.413
You could do that,

00:07:21.413 --> 00:07:24.330
but it's also already on
everyone's lock screen.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.530
I like the voice memo trigger.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.490
It's actually pretty convenient

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.530
because it immediately starts recording

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.790
when you press and hold the button.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.200
But my favorite by a mile is
the Siri Shortcuts function

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.660
because it basically lets
you do anything else.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.150
You can stack up a bunch
of different functions

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.980
that are, like, location dependent,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.650
or you can have it call a certain contact

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.850
or do certain things,

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.590
or if you just wanna literally open

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.690
any app on your phone with zero lag.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.210
So it could be your to-do
list app or your calendar app

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.240
or just open YouTube with
any one button press.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.140
Whatever you want.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.410
For me, I'm gonna map my Action button

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.220
on my brand new iPhone
to the Google Assistant,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.770
the best assistant
available on the iPhone.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.870
Also, Apple, if you're listening,

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.690
I also wish you could map a double press

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.330
or a triple press of the Action button

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.493
to a new specific function.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.620
Just think about it.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.460
Also, I was kind of curious

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.500
how cases would handle
this new Action button.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.850
So I asked channel sponsor dbrand

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.530
to send over their new Ghost case,

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.363
and I have it here.

00:08:23.363 --> 00:08:24.900
Personally, pretty solid.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.270
I think this matte black
skeleton design looks sick.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.670
And yes, I can confirm
that even with the case,

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.920
the Action button still
feels nice and clicky.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.753
Now, I might be thinking,

00:08:32.753 --> 00:08:35.370
all right, what's so special
about this clear case?

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.810
I've seen a million clear cases.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.370
And between the skeleton and MagSafe,

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.330
there's a bunch of other stuff,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.890
but my favorite personally

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.810
is if you've ever owned
a clear case before,

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.220
you probably know that after a while

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.770
it kind of ends up looking like this,

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.120
which is disgusting and yellow.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.320
But dbrand has promised me

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.960
that they've specifically
engineered the Ghost case

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.123
to be impossible to yellow,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.550
and they use those words themselves.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.140
So they actually give you

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.800
a lifetime case replacement
guarantee if it every yellows.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.920
So that's either a real promise

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.590
or free cases for life, the way I see it.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.550
Either way, if you're interested,

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.540
I'll leave a link below the like button

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.470
if you wanna check it out.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.640
That's the dbrand Ghost case.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.410
Now, I've also been taking
some pictures and videos

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.280
with these new cameras

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.840
to get a sense of how they perform.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.250
I will be taking many, many more,

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.860
posting them on on Twitter
if you wanna follow me there.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.120
Instagram as well.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.500
I also fully plan on shooting

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.320
the next Auto Focus car
channel video with this phone,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.330
so you already know you
can go subscribe over there

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.710
to see how the video looks,

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.210
to hear how the microphones sound.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.520
One thing that they did mention
in the keynote specifically

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.890
was there was a new
coating over the lenses

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.660
that I immediately thought,

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.410
oh, does this fix the horrible
nighttime flare issues

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.180
with the iPhone's video?

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.980
First thing I did was go to a dark room,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.140
bring it out at night,
shoot with some lights.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.750
No, it didn't fix it, unfortunately.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.583
I'm sure the coating

00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:51.030
does some other great
stuff during the daytime,

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.400
but there's still flare issues, sadly.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.233
But also, lastly,

00:09:54.233 --> 00:09:57.420
I wanna clarify the new camera
behavior on the Pro phones.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.410
In the impressions video,

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.845
I was a little down on the whole, like,

00:09:59.845 --> 00:10:03.390
1x versus 1.2x versus 1.5x thing,

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.790
because I thought it was
literally just a digital crop,

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.980
which would be pretty pointless to me.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.580
But it's actually closer to a
set of Super Res Zoom presets

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.070
that you can actually then
digitally zoom between.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.410
I'll detail all of this
in the full reviews.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.050
And here's some benchmark scores

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.610
in case you're curious
about that sort of thing

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.380
for performance for the A17 Pro,

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.090
which is actually new.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.800
But generally, I think that wraps up

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.840
my first, second impressions,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.330
my second look now that
I got 'em in the studio.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.720
Really I feel like the base iPhone 15s,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.070
if you wanna buy one of
these or pre-order 'em,

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.260
it's a bigger improvement
than it seems on paper.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.870
Like, nothing is actually new here,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.620
but because it's bringing things
from last year's Pro phone,

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.300
it's actually a very solid phone.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.510
And then the Pro, it's
a lot more interesting

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.030
because there's some
genuinely new stuff happening.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.040
I've seen new stuff with the cameras.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.050
Also, it seems like someone found out

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.970
the batteries are slightly
bigger across the board,

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:00.870
which is good too.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.670
We'll see if that holds up.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.540
But generally, let me know

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.510
what you wanna see in the full reviews

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.600
in the comment section below,

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.310
because I will be working on those

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.900
over the next couple days and weeks,

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.090
and hopefully you'll see that soon.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.190
Either way, thanks for watching.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.023
Catch you in the next one.

00:11:15.023 --> 00:11:15.856
Peace.

00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:20.241
(mellow electronic music)
