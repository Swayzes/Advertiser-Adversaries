00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.500
- So this is Cleo

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.210
and as you can probably immediately tell,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.950
Cleo is an awesome dog.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.840
She's one of the nicest
dogs I've ever met.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.560
She loves people, anyone
that'll give her any food.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.420
She's pretty classic dog stuff

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.900
and she also happens to
be missing her right leg.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.210
She was found on Petfinder
after she spent some time

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.480
as a stray in Oklahoma with
injuries from unknown causes.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.460
Now hanging out with Cleo
and just playing with her,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.590
like you'd almost forget,
like you wouldn't even know

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.480
that she's missing a leg 'cause
she's just running around,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.130
chasing stuff, playing fetch,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.910
she loves being outdoors,
all that classic dog stuff.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.030
But although she appears
super healthy now,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.440
dogs that are missing limbs

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.970
and any pets that are missing limbs

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.180
are actually more likely to
have things like arthritis

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.000
and joint problems in their
other limbs later in life

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.130
'cause they're compensating
for the missing limb.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.170
So she's running around being awesome now,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.610
but it would be ideal for
her long term to be supported

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.460
so that's where this company
called 3D Pets comes in.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.660
So they reached out and
they were telling me

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.060
they have a particularly
high tech solution

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.090
to the problem and asked if
I basically want to go see it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.000
and it turns out it is pretty sick.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.110
I mean, I've already
talked about this before,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.910
but there's tech in everything.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.980
Like every story, every
angle, everything I see

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.530
on the news nowadays,
it has some tech in it,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.120
but even this story surprised me at just

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.263
how much tech was involved
in helping dogs like Cleo.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.670
So it's this multi-step process.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.130
First up is this scan.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.650
So the pet comes into their studio,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.880
which is actually in New Jersey,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.890
pretty close to our video studio

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.020
and they actually use a smartphone

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.360
to 3D scan the animal.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.010
So the idea is to take a few scans,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.470
they actually use the
iPhone's LIDAR scanner

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.590
or use the true depth
camera system or both.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.930
This isn't exactly what
they were designed for,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.140
but with apps like combed and hedges,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.230
it is a pretty clever solution
for just basic measuring.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.700
So basically once you get Cleo

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.573
to hold still for long enough,

00:01:58.573 --> 00:02:00.270
you can get a pretty
decently accurate scan

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.710
of her dimensions.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.330
How high off the ground she is,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.970
how far around, the
shape of the prosthesis,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.710
what that needs to be, et cetera

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.140
and all of this is to be
used in the next step,

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.250
which is 3D printing the
prosthesis, it's crazy.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.540
Now you might be thinking

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.520
like I was at the beginning
of this, wait a second,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.570
why is there so much tech
being used in this process?

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.060
Like why is it 3D scanning the animal

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.670
and then 3D printing the prosthesis?

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.050
What's going on here?

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.040
And the real answer

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.410
as they explained it to
me basically is because

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.270
every single animal's situation
is a little bit different.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.860
No two are exactly the same

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.990
whether it's the reason
that they lost the limb

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.130
or part of the limb,

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.920
but then just like the size of
the animal, how big are they?

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.650
How far off the ground does the limb end?

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.390
How much weight are they
gonna be able to put on it?

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.490
All these different things
are slightly different

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.890
for every single animal, it's
kind of like a fingerprint.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.470
So clearly you can't just mass produce

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.480
like one size fits all prosthetic.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.650
Obviously even with humans,

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.910
you know this is is already true,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.420
but the idea is you want it
to be as custom and bespoke

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.240
and comfortable for every
single animal as possible

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.550
so this 3D printing process allows

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.700
for rapid reiteration and making
a couple different versions

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.960
till you get it exactly right

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.330
and so this is why
they're doing it this way.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.040
3D pets in particular, they've worked with

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.220
over 300 different animals
so far at their studio.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.070
They actually start with a
candidacy form on their website.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.440
But then once they get going,
they have a ton of options.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.740
To date, they've done many dogs as pets,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.150
but also some ducks, a tortoise, a pig.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.490
They had a goat recently that
was missing part of its skull

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.220
that didn't form properly and
goats like to use their heads

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.053
for stuff obviously

00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:43.710
so they made a helmet for him
and one elephant leg recently.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.170
So anyway, Cleo's scan
pretty straightforward

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.730
and within five minutes they have a couple

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.290
decently accurate models to work with

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.390
and then they import it into the computer

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.560
to move to step two.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.410
So how do you get the scan off the phone?

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.090
- Well that's the easy part.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.513
We get the scan off the
phone onto our web portal,

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.310
which we're able to bring

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.920
into a custom design software here

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.050
where that's really
where the magic happens,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.780
where we're able to take a design

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.690
and really mold it to
the 3D scan of each pet

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.090
so that we can make sure
everything's fitting perfect.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.400
- So this is Cleo's scan,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.900
and the appropriate fit as it
would be built on the scan?

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.480
- Right, so you can see the scan overlaid

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.400
and we can patch things up as needed.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.290
It's almost like 3D Photoshop in a way,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.410
but then we're able to
control the lattice,

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.240
the hardware mounts, where the straps go,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.790
we can really position
everything perfect to each pet.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.040
And then once we're happy, once it's set,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.350
then we bring it into another software

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.620
where this is where we
optimize it for printing.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.910
So we have to be able to basically

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.310
give the printer
instruction on what to make.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.920
So this is where we really fine tune

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.400
the intricacies and the
detail of each layer

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.650
'cause again, we want
some areas to be nice

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.110
and rigid where hardware
mounts, for example.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.980
But like around the rib
cage, around the lungs,

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.480
we want the flexibility

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.120
so you can see we don't have
that thick lattice there.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.760
This over here, these wings
we can really easily bend

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.560
even if the dog fluctuates in weight,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.250
we want it to accommodate those changes.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.030
But where the mount is, where
the hardware is on this end,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.490
this we want to be
really sturdy and strong

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.110
'cause that's where the impact is.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.210
So once we're happy with
this, once it's ready to go,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.220
we'll take it over to
one of the 3D printers

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.020
and we have a whole
bunch of different sizes

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.840
depending on the case,
depending on the animal,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.610
but they're all pretty
similar in how they work.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.090
- So 3D printing, to be perfectly honest,

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.550
I never really cared that
much about 3D printing.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.600
This is like a confession.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.400
Like I never...

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.570
There was a ton of hype about it

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.190
and obviously a lot of
people care a lot about it,

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.390
but every time I was brought up to me,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.520
I couldn't really find a reason to care

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.290
and we got a 3D printer at the studio

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.710
and we've printed a couple
random trinkets here and there,

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.600
mostly things that are
just like useless stuff

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.580
just to see if it'll work.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.440
Whatever, neat, but this is the first time

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.920
I've seen a situation where
3D printing clearly makes

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.590
the most sense for a
manufacturing process.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.290
Obviously you can't do one single mold,

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.300
you can't do one size fits all

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.710
so like I said,

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.830
it just made the most sense for once.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.540
They have a couple different
size printers in here

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.000
ranging from something like an Anker M5,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.500
something you might buy on Amazon

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.570
all the way up to an industrial sized one,

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.150
the size of a refrigerator,
basically to work

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.850
on different sized pieces
for different animals.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.190
So once they were happy with Cleo's design

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.790
of the prosthesis in the
software, it hits the printer

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.300
and about literally 24
hours later, it's done,

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.830
it's printed, the whole thing.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.360
Now this isn't the final step for hers.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.570
There is still a sanding down
process to soften the corners

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.790
and make it as comfortable as possible

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.110
and also in 3D printing,

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.320
there's commonly these
support pieces that you get

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.470
when you print oddly shaped
objects that need to be cut off

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.630
and they're actually working
on ways to melt that down

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.000
and use it in other
things like wheels or feet

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.580
so they can actually be
resourceful about that as well,

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.580
but they've showed me a bunch
of examples of various shapes

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.400
and sizes of things they've
printed for animals in the past.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.620
- So this one is just
about ready to ship out.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.690
This dog has a residual limb.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.210
So we have this build out
here and we do it like this

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.280
so that we can keep
the weight bearing load

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.680
right below where the limb used to be.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.390
If we have it in any other place,

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.980
they just won't be able to walk correctly.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.780
- And this is also now softened down

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.420
and it is just sanded, basically?

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.340
- We do a sand and torch.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.530
So we'll basically burn the material back

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.330
like what the machine
is doing, heating it up

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.000
to a melting temperature,
it smooths it out.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.420
And something that we're
very well known for

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.900
with our devices are our feet.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.090
And so one of the biggest
things is when the dogs

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.730
are taking steps, you want that
foot to be able to compress

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.573
to absorb that.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.273
I'll trade you.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.800
I think this is version
like five or six of the foot

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.020
and we're on version like
10 or 12 of the harness

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.570
so they're constantly
changing and adapting.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.220
If somebody reaches
out to us and they say,

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.770
I burned through a foot,
here are the reasons why,

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.940
we're gonna make the changes to the foot

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.350
so that stops happening.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.940
And so that's why we go
through our variations.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.490
We're actually working on
the next version of the foot,

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.800
which has rounder edges

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.420
so more of a radius on these edges.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.193
- Like a tire maybe?

00:08:11.193 --> 00:08:12.026
- Yeah, yeah, exactly like a tire

00:08:12.026 --> 00:08:14.430
because dogs tend to lean
on one side or the other

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.930
and we'll typically have
the owners flip it around

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.400
once they start to wear on one side

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.780
so it wears evenly.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.293
- A tire rotation?

00:08:20.293 --> 00:08:21.930
- Exactly, a foot rotation.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.670
And then behind you, we
have some of our carts

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.740
that are in process too.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.580
So this is one going
down to a dog in Texas.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.590
She's got two deformed limbs.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.240
In fact one is really not formed at all,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.310
but she's got one deformed
here on the left hand side.

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:36.750
So we make provisions for that

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.300
so that the shoulders
can still move around.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.300
So this'll get three six
inch wheels on each corner.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.640
And then this, this is
another good example.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.600
This is for a dachshund that
has one full remaining leg

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.820
and had a partial amputation.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.790
And so the owners didn't want
something extremely bulky,

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.890
but they wanted that
front leg to have support

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.320
'cause dachshunds have
a lot of back problems.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.320
So we designed this
specifically for this case

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.260
where the dachshund can
put its legs and move it

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.210
and still have the
support on the outer edges

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.410
and we still have our
flexible harness here.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.050
And the wheels can
change camber as well too

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.952
so depending on--

00:09:14.952 --> 00:09:16.035
- Sport mode.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.040
- And we'll go up to
eight or 10 inch wheels.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.600
I think you saw this one.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.803
- That Escalade dogs.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.890
- We should do spinners
on one of these rooms

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.240
one of these days honestly.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.900
I haven't put it past people.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.510
The woman that we did our
original dachshund cart for,

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.250
she saw our black wheels and she was like,

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.110
I'd like silver rims, please,

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.460
and I thought she was joking.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.078
I totally thought she was joking

00:09:40.078 --> 00:09:40.920
and I was like, oh, that's a cool idea.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.170
She was like, no, really
I want silver wheels.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.610
- Would you paint it or would you--

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.780
- We ended up painting it.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.953
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:47.825 --> 00:09:49.710
- So, Cleo's scan was pretty good.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.060
Then they designed her prosthesis

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.400
around that scan, that went great.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.040
Then they printed it, sanded
it, and torched it down

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.560
and matched it with
the leg for her height.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.220
The only step left now
is to see how it works.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.870
So what I kind of didn't realize is

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.300
it's not just like you attach
the prosthesis to the dog

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.520
and then they just magically
start running around perfectly

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.840
like they've had it their whole life.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.820
But no, like anyone who's
had crutches knows this,

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.100
there's actually an adjustment process

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.500
as you get more and more used to it.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.070
So I got to watch Cleo
sort of learn in real time

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.830
even in just these few
minutes, go from hovering it

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.920
off the ground to eventually
starting to trust it.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.440
And the process of them getting used to it

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.540
depending on the pet is
basically to introduce them

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.640
to more and more time per day with it

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.070
so that they eventually get
used to totally living with it.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.200
Maybe 20 minutes a day at the beginning,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.930
then it's an hour a day,
then two hours a day

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.420
and you slowly see them start
to remap their muscle memory

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.970
and unlearn walking without the limb

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.160
and really trust it and
depend on it by the end.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.350
So at the end of the day, I
thought this was super cool

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.550
and basically it's a huge
win for pets like Cleo

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.230
and it's also super cool

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.200
that it's enabled by tech that
feels relatively accessible,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.260
like a phone in our
pocket, a computer app,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.510
one or two pieces of
software and then 3D printers

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.030
like all things that we
can get started with,

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.790
that's how they got started
with building this studio

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.950
in New Jersey and actually
helping so many pets

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.900
and they actually now will
continue to evolve this.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.460
There's other places around the country

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.050
in the world doing the same sort of thing,

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:20.670
but they potentially
can do remote creations

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.350
for pets that don't come to the studio

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.600
but they get to like send a mold in

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.580
and then build a prosthesis
for other animals

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.050
they don't even get to see.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.370
I'm not even gonna pretend to be an expert

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.620
on 3D printing or prosthesis,

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.590
but like hopefully this helps more animals

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.880
sort of extend their
lives and live more freely

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.810
I think is the right word.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.040
These pieces are typically priced

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.180
from a couple 100 bucks
to up to 1,000 or $2,000

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.210
and ideally will last a lifetime

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.980
at least if they've stopped growing.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.970
So thanks to 3D Pets

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.680
for letting me pull back
the curtain a little bit

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.440
into how they use tech to do what they do.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.750
Thanks to Cleo for letting
me hang out all day

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.750
and thanks to you for watching.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.613
See you in the next one, peace.
