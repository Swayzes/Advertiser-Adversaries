One of our top videos of all time is explaining what the heck i7, i5, and i3 mean.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.420
So, Intel fixed it by making it worse.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.260
What exactly is a Core Ultra 7 155H?

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.740
I can't blame you for having no idea because even Intel doesn't seem to know how this is gonna work

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.480
when the entry-level mobile and the desktop chips launch. I mean, how can one be

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.120
Ultra, but also mid? And what is this? Just two high-performance cores?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.800
What is ultra about that? The good news is that Intel's new Meteor Lake chips are

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
legitimately exciting and

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.040
Naming aside, if they are an indication of where Pat Gelsinger's Intel is headed

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.240
I think we are seeing the first signs of a reestablishment of Intel's old dominance.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.080
Exhibit A, the Asus ZenBook 14 OLED. It packs a Core Ultra 7 155H, which means

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.080
something.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.280
Here's a quick message from our sponsor first.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.020
The Ridge! Looking for a stylish and practical wallet? Well, look at this thing. It's the Ridge wallet.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.560
It's got a minimalist design and allows you to carry all your essential cards and cash without the bulk.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.880
To compare against our Core Ultra ZenBook,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.280
we chose a Framework 13, investment disclosure, with Intel's last generation 1370p, an Acer Swifty,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.920
sorry, Swift Edge with AMD 7840U, and a 14-inch M3 MacBook. More on that one later.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.960
First, let's talk results. Straight out of the gate, our Meteor Lake Core Ultra 7 155H

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.440
annihilates Intel's last-gen Core i7 1370p in nearly every game we tested.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.520
Hopefully Framework is working on a Core Ultra upgrade because, dang,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.320
Cyberpunk at 1080p on integrated graphics?

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.400
It is now playable at 30 FPS average instead of just 16. Not only that,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400
it's nipping at AMD's heels.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.360
Rocket League? That is almost 69% nicer than last year's model. And wait a minute. What's this? A clear win over AMD?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.640
Well, not quite. If we look closely at the all-important 1% lows, the gains aren't

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.520
quite as impressive, especially in Rocket League, where we can't even hear AMD's victory speech because they already dropped their mic

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600
so many times they broke it.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.400
But, with that said, I love the trajectory that I'm seeing here. In one generation,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.880
we are still on first-generation Intel Arc. Intel has gone from basically unusable to,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.240
hey, this thing's kind of viable. Let's bolt it onto our CPUs so all of a sudden they can AAA game.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.720
Dota 2 running on DirectX 11? Big win for Arc. Shadow of the Tomb Raider? Another one. Total War Pharaoh?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.160
Another one. Grid Legends?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.600
Not so much, but Intel is adamant that they are seeing better results on their system for this one,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.760
so hopefully that's just a bug that needs to be squashed. Now, you may have noticed Apple's M3 MacBook Pro

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.600
sneaking into our gaming slides there. And if you consider Apple's push toward the gaming crowd with their Metal API, it makes sense.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.480
We thought it would only be fair to choose the most price-appropriate model and see what it can do in comparison. As it turns out,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.600
even though we're going through a Rosetta or Vulcan translation layer on both Tomb Raider and Dota, the answer is

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.560
surprisingly well. Take a look at Dota 2 using Vulcan.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.380
Okay, yes, running all the systems on Vulcan does harm our Windows machines results a little bit,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.280
but Apple is beating AMD's results both on Vulcan and on DX11.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.120
Like Intel, Apple is still struggling with frame time consistency, and you can see that in the 1% low results.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.480
But again, this is all about trajectory, and Apple has also gone from gaming loser to gaming varsity jock

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.720
practically overnight.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.720
Speaking of post-secondary,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.760
the dropout sweater, lttstore.com? Anyway, there's still a giant blue elephant in the room, and

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.000
that is non-gaming performance for Core Ultra. It's a

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.720
kind of a mixed bag.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.520
Let's start with handbrake. Encoding Big Buck Bunny at 1080p with h.264. In performance mode,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.560
we get almost 63 frames per second. That keeps up with both Apple and AMD while beating our

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.200
framework with the last-gen 1370p.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.240
All right, but step that up to our 4k footage of Red Dead Redemption 2, and Intel's Core Ultra looks more like a Core...

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.040
Somehow, it even fell behind the last-gen 1370p. I mean, it's okay,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.380
it's not like they lose by a lot, but regression from one generation to the next, and look what happens when we encode with AV1.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.240
Yikes.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.000
Apple rockets into its own performance class entirely in our Big Buck Bunny 1080p test,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.200
with Core Ultra falling into last place again, and

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.440
4k Red Dead is a similar story with Apple in lead, and Intel's latest in dead last.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:23.020
One notable X factor here, though, is that AMD pulls off a clear win not in speed, but in file size.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.920
So, they might be going slower than Apple, but you're gonna end up with near-identical

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.960
quality in files that are up to 15% smaller than the competition.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.800
Encoding isn't our Core Ultra 7's only weak point either. In our Chrome benchmark,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.860
which is admittedly not the best showcase of Apple's typical browser capabilities,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.740
Sorry, Safari.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.780
Intel's new hotness loses again in Jetstream 2 and in MotionMark.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.900
It does beat AMD in speedometer, but it loses handily to both its own predecessor and to Apple.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.860
Oh, speaking of Jetstream, we've also got Ludwig's bidets in stock on lttstore.com, the Swype and Swype Plus.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.780
That stream is sure to leave you nice and clean every time you do your business. Do your business? Can we just say poop?

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.580
We'll say poop. Moving on to Cinebench.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:15.700
Multicore looking pretty good, thanks to those two extra low power efficiency cores. More on those and the NPU later.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.740
But the reduced clock speed really seems to hurt our single core performance and

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.780
Puget Bench's Photoshop benchmark reveals a similar story where the new chip is actually slower than last gen.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.060
Intel,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.260
what have you done in search of better onboard gaming performance? You've given us so much.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.740
But at what cost?

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:45.220
Not as much as you might think. It's not all doom and gloom on the productivity side. When it comes to 7-zip compression, for example,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.020
wow, the 155H smokes the competition in both standard and performance mode.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.420
And while Photoshop wasn't great in the Premiere Pro benchmark, it manages a very confident looking win.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.380
But wait a second. What happened with Apple? Well, here's the thing.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.860
You can find all of these laptops at the links down below.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.980
But to save you a bit of trouble, the Asus costs about $1,300 with 32 gigs of RAM. The Acer, also $1,300,

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.020
16 gigs of RAM. And our price competitive MacBook Pro?

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.460
Well, it's only sort of price competitive to start with at $1,600.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:26.300
But more importantly comes with only 8 gigabytes of memory, which was not enough to complete this test without the program crashing.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:32.060
Now we could spend yet another $200 and have 16 gigs of RAM in it.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:38.020
But then we'd be pitting our Windows machines against something that costs over 30% more money,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:43.980
which seemed a little silly when the rest of the results do a pretty good job of showcasing the M3's potential.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.220
And this allows me to make a point to Apple. Guys, you've done this to yourself.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.980
Please stop selling 8 gig

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.260
professional machines. You saved like 15 to 20 dollars on your bill of materials,

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.300
but on any workload that goes to a swap file, you are embarrassing yourselves.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.860
You're not the only one. Intel didn't do too well in Blender either. And, you know, overall,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:13.300
mediocre improvements or even worse performance can be super disappointing when you're testing the new hotness.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:19.180
But it's kind of hard to stay mad because while one window might have narrowed,

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:24.700
it's like an entirely new door has been flung open. Because aside from gaming performance,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:32.300
Meteor Lake has another really cool trick up its sleeve. Let's talk about the new neural processing unit or NPU.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:40.700
Your current CPU and GPU combo can already handle AI workloads like stable diffusion or using generative fill in Adobe Photoshop.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.020
So I don't blame you for asking. Why exactly do we need an NPU?

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.460
Well, let me tell you. An NPU is an

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:56.180
integrated AI accelerator designed to enable new and enhanced experiences with the power efficiency required for mobile platforms.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.180
We're gonna do a full explainer over on Techquickie,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:05.180
but in a nutshell what this corporate marketing jargon means is that it helps to alleviate the strain on your CPU and GPU

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.220
using processors that are more optimized for these loads.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.700
It's kind of like when PPUs or physics processing units came out almost 20 years ago,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:22.020
except that this time we just skipped the part where it's a dedicated card and went straight to adding a tile to the CPU that

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.420
lights up when you're doing speech-to-text or background audio removal or whatever.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.020
Okay, wait. Tile?

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:37.140
This is where Meteor Lake gives us an exciting glimpse into Intel's future. It's their first tile-based CPU,

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:43.940
packaging together several pieces of silicon on one chip rather than using a traditional monolithic die.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.260
You've got your main CPU tile,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:54.420
which is built on the Intel 4 process with Redwood Cove P-Cores and Crestmont E-Cores, an I-O tile for connectivity features like

00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:01.420
Thunderbolt and additional PCIe lanes, a TSMC manufactured GPU tile for your ARC graphics,

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:06.420
and then there's the really interesting TSMC manufactured SOC tile.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.340
This bad boy has actually got two LP or

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.140
Low Power Island E-Cores that'll handle light tasks,

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.540
allowing the main P and E-Cores to be powered off completely to extend battery life.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:26.860
It's got Wi-Fi 6E, which is supposedly upgradable to Wi-Fi 7 later, and Bluetooth 5.4, a

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:34.020
NOC or network-on-chip to interconnect all the different parts of the SOC, and they've even managed to pack the Xe media and

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:39.860
display engine here, rather than using the GPU tile for your display out and simple video decoding tasks.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.740
It's got some other stuff, like USB 3 and 4, Ethernet, audio security, etc.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.860
And it's got that shiny new NPU block. The reason that I'm so excited about this is that

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.980
suddenly Intel can take a more modular approach to CPU design.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:58.420
I mean, look at how AMD can turn a single core complex die design and then

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:04.940
repackage it into anything from a basic desktop processor to a beastly server or workstation chip.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.700
Well, that is similar to what we're looking at here.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:16.780
New Wi-Fi? Plonk. New CPU core architecture? Plonk that in. New ARC battle-mage graphics? Plonk that too.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.660
TSMC's got a new node that you haven't figured out yet? Go ahead and plonk that as well.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:28.780
I see this modular design approach making Intel far more agile and improving their competitiveness in a big way.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.460
Coming back to the NPU,

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.780
we don't really have a great benchmark for testing these things yet, and we don't even have another NPU to drag race it against.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:42.060
But in the Procyon machine learning inference benchmark, we got 241 points, which is

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:49.600
heads and tails above everything except for the ARC graphics that Intel included on the very same chip.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:56.620
However, that doesn't mean it's a dud. What's impressive about this result is that our power consumption drops

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.260
considerably when we push these workloads onto the NPU.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.740
So it might not be long before this is the part of your computer that's doing the lifting

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.220
instead of your graphics cards, at least when it comes to light, everyday machine learning tasks.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.340
Which leads us finally into our discussion about the new naming conventions,

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:21.140
because I'm starting to think they used machine learning to come up with these. All we've got right now is high-end mobile, and the

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:27.460
first thing is that after 15 years of begging, Apple finally convinced Intel to stop calling things

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.100
i-something.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:37.260
Instead, we're gonna have Intel Core and Intel Core Ultra, followed by what Intel calls the brand level.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.740
These are somewhat familiar and denote what sort of power level you can expect.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:48.140
3, 5, and 7 for the more mainstream core processors, and then 5, 7, and 9

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:53.500
for the more premium core ultra chips. And yes, that's a lot of overlap.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:13:01.020
Bigger numbers will generally indicate more cores, faster ones, and bigger caches though, with smaller ones being the opposite.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.020
You guys still with me?

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:09.340
Great. Next, we've got the processor number, which is broken down into series, skew number, and suffix.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:15.740
You can think of it almost like a hard reset of the product stack. So Meteor Lake, that's what we've got now.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.740
That's the first in the series, hence the 1 in our Core Ultra 7

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.220
155H.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.220
Converting back to the old system for a moment,

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:30.300
this is nth gen, and a nth gen replacement of this should be a Core Ultra 7

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:36.860
255H, and then so on and so forth, until they change it, because who knows? Model numbers are arbitrary anyway.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:42.780
The skew number is where it gets a bit more complicated. I know, right? More complicated anyway.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.820
This is where the numbers get a little more different from what we're used to.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:54.620
The big curveball is that the skew number can be reused across different chips within the same generation. More on that later.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:01.060
Anyway, these denote multiple tiers within a stack. So for example, the Intel Core Ultra 5

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:08.860
135H and the 125H are similar, but the 135H has a 100 megahertz clock bump.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.020
Finally, there's the suffix.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:17.860
I assume that K and T will be back on the desktop to denote overclockable and low power chips,

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.780
but so far we only have mobile and we only have two letters, H or U.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:29.820
H chips are typically more power hungry, while U chips are meant for ultra slim devices that use less power.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.540
This also has some precedent,

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:39.140
but the problem with this is that combined with the possibility for skew number reuse, which I mentioned before,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:46.340
it means that you can have no idea how performant a processor is until you get to the suffix.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:53.740
So Intel claims that they were trying to simplify things, but in my opinion, they have just made them more confusing.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.700
No, mom. Sorry, but that Core Ultra 7

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.380
165U sucks. I need the Core Ultra 7

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.820
165H because not only does it have more GPU cores,

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.380
it has three times the performance cores and double the cache.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:17.300
There's a lot to like about Meteor Lake and I love Intel's push to reinvest in process node leadership and build out a competitive

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:22.220
foundry business. I'm not an analyst and this is not financial advice,

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.540
but I'm excited about where they're going.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:32.140
What I'm not excited about is explaining this new naming scheme to friends and family that are looking to purchase a new laptop over the

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.460
next few years.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:39.580
I am also excited, though, to tell you about our sponsor. Thanks to Grammarly for sponsoring this video. Here at Linus Media Group,

If you guys enjoyed this video, make sure to check out the last time we explained Intel's naming scheme.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.060
It was a simpler time back then.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.420
Back then.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.420
Back then.
