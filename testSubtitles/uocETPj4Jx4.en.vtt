00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.801
- This is half a million
dollars (cash register dings)

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:02.635
in cash.

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:05.038
And whichever one of
them, I tag last keeps it.

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:05.872
10,

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:06.973
nine,

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:07.807
eight,

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:08.975
- Oh my God. Oh my God.
- [Jimmy] seven,

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:10.176
- Oh my God.
- [Jimmy] six,

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.011
five,

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:11.978
- Oh boy.
- [Jimmy] four,

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:12.812
three,

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:13.646
- All right. We're going into the stadium.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:14.481
- [Jimmy] Two,

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.315
one.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:16.249
Ready or not,

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.083
here I come.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:17.917
- [Contestant] Everyone's
running this way.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:18.852
I don't know if that's a good thing.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:19.986
- Look at all those people.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:20.820
(bell dings)

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.654
(bubble popping)

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:22.489
These people are actually the finalists

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.456
from my previous video.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.626
They literally sat in a
circle for 12 days straight

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:27.627
to earn a spot in this

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:28.495
game of tag.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:29.696
This stadium could fit over

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.531
160,000 people inside of it.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.799
This is gonna take forever.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.134
- I'm running as far away as I can.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.468
It's gonna get exhausting, quick.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.771
- So I made an alliance
with Classy and Blakely.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.539
And we have a triangular formation

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.074
to make sure nobody gets caught.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.642
- Airrack's over there
watching the exit that way.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.843
I'm watching the hallway this way.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.645
And we got Blakely watching down there.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.547
- It's definitely nerve wracking.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.382
- We're currently on the
first of three floors.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.483
And if I was trying to hide from me,

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.018
I would go as far away as possible,

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:53.520
which would take me to the third floor.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.121
- Oh, this is pretty comfortable.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.157
- Oh yeah, V suite, you know.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.191
- I'm hiding here

00:00:58.191 --> 00:00:59.726
behind this electrical box.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:00.560
- As you can see,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.694
this hallway is super long.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:02.629
There's like,

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.463
50 rooms.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.864
I'm gonna check them, one at a time.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:05.832
That one's locked.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.734
- All right, this door over here.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.135
(bell dings)

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.303
But I'm pretty sure it's locked.

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:12.072
- I've been searching for hours

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.007
and haven't tagged a single person.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.642
This place is just too big.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.077
Attention contestants,

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:19.112
it's taking me forever to find you,

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.214
so I'm bringing in Chris and Chandler.

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.048
Come on up.

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:22.882
Chris, you go that way.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:23.716
Chandler, you go that way.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:24.551
I'm just pointing places.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:25.385
Let's go.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.655
- Both Chris and Chandler
are now looking for us

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:29.856
along with Jimmy.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.859
(suspenseful music)

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:37.430
(bell dings)

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.264
- Who is that?

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.099
You see that over?

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.933
- Oh, there's people.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:40.767
Go, go, go, go,
(bell dings)

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.235
go, go, go!

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:43.570
- [Jordan] Aahh!

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.941
(bell dings)

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:52.846
- Yes, yes! We got someone.
(buzzer buzzes)

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:53.746
- [Jimmy and Chandler] Yeah!

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:54.781
- [Jimmy] Oh, oh my gosh.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.116
Attention contestants.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:58.051
We got our very first person out.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:58.885
- I think it was Jordan,

00:01:58.885 --> 00:01:59.953
the girl in the green shirt.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.588
They just escorted her over there.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:03.056
- Here's a briefcase with
$10,000. (cash register ding)

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.591
We gotta tag more people.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.693
- I guess one down, nine more to go.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.461
- And while I was giving Jordan her money,

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.029
Chris saw Chris.

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.298
That sounded weird.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.133
- Right there. (bell dings)

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:13.967
Go, go, go.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:17.070
He's down here, down here, down here.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.506
- [Jimmy] Don't hate me,

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.407
but Chandler might have
outran the cameraman

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.343
and tagged Chris off camera.
(punching sound)

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.177
Whoops.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:25.011
(buzzer buzzes)

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:25.845
- No way.

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:26.679
- Pretty devastated.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.514
He's a fast man.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.481
- If it makes you feel better,

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.315
here's $10,000. (cash register ding)

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.150
- Thank you so much.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.984
- Attention contestants.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.385
A second person has fallen.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.219
Only eight of you remain.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.154
We're coming for all of you.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.022
Taylor, you are so fast
that Frank couldn't keep up.

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.357
(bell dings)
- He's really fast.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:38.391
- Here's a GoPro. Wear it.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.226
- How do you feel being top eight?

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.561
- I feel fire. How do you feel?

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.129
- I feel bored. (laughing)

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.963
- [Jimmy] Now, remember

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.031
that these contestants are only competing

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.033
for half a million dollars
(bell dings)

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.301
because they're subscribed to our channel.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.869
If you wanna one day be
in one of our videos,

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:50.703
hit the

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:51.638
subscribe button right now.
(punching sound)

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:52.539
It is currently 5:00 AM,

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.874
and Chandler and Chris want to go to bed.

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:57.844
So, I've replaced them
with SapNap and Carl.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:58.678
Let's go hunt more people.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.246
- It's me, Carl and SapNap.
- Let's get it!

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.481
- [Jimmy] Carl, SapNap and I searched

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.217
throughout the entire night
and couldn't find anyone.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:07.387
Somehow the contestants had
enough energy to outrun us

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.622
until the morning.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:10.723
- It's the entire next day.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:11.724
We've been out for so long.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.159
- If yesterday were the semifinals,

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.427
today's the finals.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:15.228
- It's gonna be stressful.

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:16.930
I am fatigued mentally and physically.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.831
- We've only found two people so far.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.166
But here's the thing,

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.901
it's tag, not hide and seek.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:22.735
- Ooh.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:23.570
- So, I'm gonna activate

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.404
the GPS
(bubble popping)

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:25.405
I put on all their phones.
(notification bling)

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:26.239
And I see a person over there.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.073
You let 'em know.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:28.007
- Hey, a little heads up,

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:29.842
Jimmy turned your guys tracker on

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.111
and he is on his way to catch you.

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:33.880
- He turned the GPS tracker on

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.449
and we're not sure if,
what's gonna happen now.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.417
- Thanks to the tracker,

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:38.818
we found Jessica,

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:41.621
I saw someone right up here.

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.089
chased her down,

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:44.657
- Leave me alone!

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:45.625
- [Frank] Get her Carl, get her.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.759
- [Jimmy] and tagged her.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:47.660
- Oh.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.761
Yo.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:49.596
- [Jimmy] Right there Carl,
(bell dings)

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:50.430
is a ton of people.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.798
Here. Can you take yourself to prison?

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:52.632
I gotta go.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.267
- Take $500,000 from me,
(cash register ding)

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.703
and you're not even
gonna take me to prison?

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:57.537
(cash register ding)

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:58.905
- Another person down.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.673
Only seven of you remain.

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:01.708
- Jessica just got out.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:02.642
So it looks like,

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:04.310
I am carrying this for the ladies.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.478
- We gotta contest meetup over here.

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:07.447
How we doing? (explosion)

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.281
- Ooh.

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:09.082
- Seven people left.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:09.916
How you feelin'?

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:10.416
- I feel good.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.217
(walkie talkie beeps)

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.285
- Wait.

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.287
Contestants, did one of
you get it a bad wreck

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.922
or did one of you flip a golf cart?

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.324
- It may or may not have
been me and Airrack.

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:19.692
(heavy metal music)

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:20.526
- Huh!

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:21.361
- We just flipped a golf cart.

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.563
- Why exactly did you flip a golf cart?

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:24.731
- Because the keys were in it

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.132
and they told us we couldn't drive it.

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.501
And if we can't drive it, neither can you.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:29.335
- It's funny content.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:30.169
So, I'm okay with it.

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.204
Despite having the tracker,

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:32.772
this place was just too big.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:33.640
For whatever reason,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.275
it had a ten second delay.
(clock ticking)

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.843
So by the time I got to where they were,

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:38.945
they were already on the
other side of the stadium.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.413
- We're moving across the whole stadium

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.115
to try to get like, a better angle,

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.316
maybe a better spot.

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:44.150
Because you always gotta keep moving,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.984
you know what I mean?

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.119
- We started this challenge

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.220
almost 20 hours ago,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.489
and we've literally
only found three people.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:52.058
I've never felt more
defeated in my entire life.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:54.127
Why did we pick such a huge stadium?

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.495
I can't find anyone.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:57.230
I need to drastically shrink this place,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.765
or this is gonna go on for a week.

00:04:58.765 --> 00:04:59.999
- Y'all, something's about to change.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.034
We've been walking around forever,

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.403
and Jimmy said he's making an announcement

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:04.537
in a couple of seconds.

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:06.039
- It's time I do something drastic.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.142
This is supposed to be a game
of tag, not hide and seek.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.311
I'm gonna shrink the entire stadium down

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.745
to just the racetrack.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:13.846
You have 10 minutes.

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.481
And one of you is getting
half a million dollars.

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:16.316
(cash register dings)

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.084
- Oh my gosh.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:20.153
- This is full on tag.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:20.987
No hiding.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.356
- I think this is gonna
get a whole lot faster,

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.657
a whole lot quicker.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:25.491
- Going in the circle

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:26.626
with Andy right now.

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:28.594
I think our plan is to
stay as mobile as possible.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:29.662
- Like I said before,

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.464
contestants you have
10 minutes to get down

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:32.332
to the racetrack.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.399
I'm in the middle with my eyes closed.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:34.233
Go.

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.068
One, (intense music)

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:35.902
two,

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:36.703
- You're gonna count to 10 minutes?

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:37.603
- three, four,

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:38.538
- I guess we're just doing this.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:39.872
- five,
Close your eyes.

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:40.707
Six...

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.275
(intense music)

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.277
- [Jimmy and Chris] 51, one minute 52,

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.778
one minute 53,

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.847
(intense music)

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.884
(both mumbling numbers)

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:52.719
- Ready or not, here we come.

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.487
We're ripping money out your hands.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.888
- Huddled up, next to a Lambo.

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:57.123
Pretty cool.

00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:58.524
- I think I got a pretty good spot.

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:00.860
If I need to move that way I can.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.794
I can be here.

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:04.364
- It's gonna make me
uncomfortable to rip $500,000

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.099
out of a stranger's hand.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.233
- I think he's going inside
the red building right

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:08.067
in front of us.

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:10.536
We are unnoticed, so far.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:11.571
- We're in here.

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:15.908
- I sure hope there aren't
no people trying to hide.

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.413
- Oh Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris.

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.447
Out to the right. Out to the right.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:22.548
All right?

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:23.616
(bell dings)

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:24.884
All right, on three.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:25.718
Three, go.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.388
(intense music)

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:34.961
- [Chris] My legs are
hurting from yesterday.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.631
Jimmy, I'm on the left side flank.

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:39.465
I see him.

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:40.433
He's back on the back wall,

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.001
running right side.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.304
(bell dings)

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:46.139
- Oh, hey.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.973
There's another guy.

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:48.541
They're trying to do a splitzy ditzy.

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.042
I'm holding up a number behind my back.

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:50.943
Is it one or two?

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:51.778
What's your pick?

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:52.612
- Two.
- What's your pick?

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:53.446
- One.
- It was one.

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:54.313
Chris target red.

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:56.983
(intense music)

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:58.184
Okay, we made a mistake.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.018
We made a mistake.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:06:59.852
We're going for green.

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:00.853
He's slower.

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:08.394
You know it's serious
cause the hat's gone.

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:10.363
- [Andy] I'm hiding next
to a Lambo right now.

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:12.432
I dunno if that's metaphor
for something or what?

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.100
But...

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.703
- Let's just, let's just come in these.

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:18.538
- Oh no.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:21.174
(intense music)

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:22.542
(buzzer buzzes)

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:24.677
- Oh hey wait, wait, wait Chris, Chris.

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:25.511
Forget about her.

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:26.345
He's getting away.

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:27.680
This man here is ruthless.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.915
Go right there.

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:31.584
(intense music)

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.791
Yeah.

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:39.625
Oh my gosh.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:40.460
We were chasing him,

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.661
and you just popped outta nowhere.

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:42.829
- I thought you guys saw me.

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.397
I thought both of you
made eye contact with me.

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:45.832
So I decided to dip.

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.133
- Not only did we get one person out,

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:47.967
(bell dings)

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:48.801
but we just got two people out.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:49.635
(bell dings)

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:50.803
Only five of you remain.

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.071
And one of you is getting

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:54.140
half a million dollars.
(cash register dings)

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:54.974
- 500,000 dollars, right there.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.275
Five people left in tag.

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:57.910
- This is it.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.445
Made it to the finals.

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:00.313
- This is so scary.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.314
I'm gonna try to steal a Lambo.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.148
- All right.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:02.982
We subbed Chris out for SapNap.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:03.816
Let's do this.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:04.650
Five people remain.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.485
Most of them are pretty quick.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.419
I need your help.
- You got it.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:07.253
(bell dings)
- What's up?

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.087
- Sup?

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:08.888
- Pretty good spot.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.490
- Find a spot where I can see,

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.558
and find a spot where I can run.

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:13.392
- I see them.

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:14.494
I see 'em in the middle.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.328
You see 'em?

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.162
- Yeah.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:16.996
- Where are they?

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:17.830
- I don't know.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.664
- I thought I saw someone over here.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.600
(intense music)

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.567
(buzzer buzzes)

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:22.435
Help me. Help me.

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:23.269
Sap help.

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:24.103
- Trust me.

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:25.338
You don't wanna catch me.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.272
I'm getting the golf cart.

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:27.306
I can't outrun these guys.

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:28.474
I gotta steal a Lambo.

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:29.308
Hey, you don't wanna tag me.

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:30.142
Trust me.

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:33.946
Oh lock.

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:34.947
Lock, lock, lock.

00:08:34.947 --> 00:08:35.781
- Wait.

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:36.616
Is he getting in the Lamborghini?

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:37.450
Wait, did he just...

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.584
- [SapNap] He's stuck.
- Great, move out the way.

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:40.152
- Go, go. Wrong door.

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:41.787
Jimmy, get on the other door.

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:42.622
- They're right on the other side of us.

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:43.689
- Oh no.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:44.690
This is bad.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.525
- All right.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.359
Now he can't drive it.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.193
All right.
We got him boxed in.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.029
- No, no, no, no, no, no jam.

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:51.297
No, no.

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:52.198
- They're on the other side

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.032
of this car.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:54.066
- He probably thinks
one of us has to leave,

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.601
and he just starts out the door.

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:56.435
Well, here's the thing.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:57.236
I make the rules.

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:59.238
Hey Carl, can you bring
me the Lamborghini key?

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:01.374
- Oh no, no, no, no.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.543
This is not how I expected
this to go down, man.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.677
I don't want to hang out with Carl.

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.178
I don't wanna see this guy.

00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:07.280
I don't wanna see Carl.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.381
- Come over here.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.649
- Hey, hey, hey.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:10.950
I have not tagged anyone yet.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.784
Give me the keys.

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:12.618
- Give Jimmy the keys.

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:14.287
- Give me the keys.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:15.121
- Oh no.

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.322
- You are officially

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:17.256
going to be my first tag.

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:18.090
(buzzer buzzes)

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:18.925
- Yes.

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:20.159
- I actually got someone out.

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:21.994
If we actually left the
keys in that Lamborghini,

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.029
he could have zipped.

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:23.863
- I would've left, yeah.

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:24.897
I wouldn't be here anymore.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:25.765
- They're walking away.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:26.999
They were next to us for like 10 minutes.

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.834
- Step on into the prison.

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:29.869
And boom!

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.237
Only three people remain.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.205
To the three of you that
are still out there,

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.507
only one of you is getting

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:35.441
half a million dollars,
(cash register dings)

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:37.743
and the other two will be sad.
(somber music)

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:39.845
(intense music)

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:40.680
- Absolutely terrifying.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.981
It's down to three people.

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:43.916
- Somehow, I'm in the top three

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.651
for $500,000 dollars.

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:48.354
- I have to keep fighting.

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:50.456
I did not abuse my body for nothing.

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:51.724
- Oh, in Goodyear.

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:52.758
Hey, there's a guy in Goodyear.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.160
- Oh man.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.428
I can see them.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:56.262
I don't know if they can see me.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.730
I could be giving myself away.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.698
- He can only go out
the left, (bell dings)

00:09:58.698 --> 00:09:59.532
the right
(bell dings)

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:00.366
or the middle.
(bell dings)

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:01.200
There's only three ways he can leave.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.234
- I'm gonna hide behind the U-Haul.

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:03.603
I need you to make noise that way.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.837
And then whenever he runs this way,

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:05.671
- You'll get him?
- let me know,

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:06.639
and I'll get him.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.308
(intense music)

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:17.883
(buzzer buzzes)

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:18.718
- Oh.

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:19.552
- Yes!

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:20.553
- No!

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:21.387
- I'm sorry

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:22.221
- Aahhh!

00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:23.055
- Carl.

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:24.090
You genius.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.058
- It worked. It worked.

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:28.361
- Yes. This is the weirdest
thing we've ever done.

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:29.695
If it makes you feel any better as

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:31.964
a consolation prize for
coming in third place,

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:33.232
we're gonna be giving you

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:34.333
$20,000 dollars.

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.401
- That's awesome.

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:36.235
(everyone clapping)

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:37.136
- Lincoln and Andy, you guys spent

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:38.771
12 days in a circle

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:41.907
and 24 hours running
from us in a game of tag.

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.442
And it all comes down to this.

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.311
One of you is getting
half a million dollars.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.412
I'm gonna go find you.

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:47.513
- Top two, I guess.

00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:48.314
- This is it.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.016
- I gotta stay focused cause two

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:50.850
is great,

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.718
but it doesn't matter
till it's number one.

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:54.186
- We've literally done this for 24 hours.

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:55.221
One more person,

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:57.957
and then I get to go to bed.

00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:59.925
That is ironic.

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:01.127
I saw him move from it.

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:01.961
- I really hope he didn't,

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:03.396
but I think he might have saw me.

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.964
- Hey, whoever's behind

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:05.798
that white barrel,
(bell dings)

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:06.632
go ahead and stand up.

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:07.466
Go 'head, stand up.

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:08.300
I see you.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.135
Hey, we come in peace.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:09.969
We come in peace.

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:10.903
- All right. All right. All right.

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:11.904
What do you guys want?

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:13.005
- They might have found someone.

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:14.006
I can't tell.

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.274
- Before I start chasing after you,

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:16.108
I'm just curious.

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:16.942
- Yeah.

00:11:16.942 --> 00:11:17.777
- If you do win,
(bell dings)

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:19.045
what are you spending the
half a million dollars on?

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.646
- I wanna set up my future and I wanna,

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:21.480
I wanna help other people.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.682
- Hopefully you outrun me then.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:23.482
- All right.

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:24.383
- Go ahead and get a little closer, Carl.

00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:26.018
- You might as well go that way, bro.

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:27.453
You are not getting past me.

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:30.122
(intense music)

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:34.126
- It is Andy.

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:35.428
Oh my God. Oh my God.

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:36.262
Andy's running.

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:38.097
(everyone screaming and cheering)

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:40.833
(dramatic music)

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:43.969
- Get him Jimmy!

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:44.804
(buzzer buzzes)

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:46.305
- You got him!
- I got him!

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:48.774
- I think it was the stupid
fanny pack. (laughing)

00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:49.575
- Oh my God.

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:50.443
Did I just win this?

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:51.577
Did I just...

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:53.245
- Congratulations Lincoln!

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:55.081
You just won half a million dollars!

00:11:55.081 --> 00:12:00.086
(energetic music) (everyone cheering)

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.923
- Oh my god, bruh. (laughing)

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:05.257
(horn honking)

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:06.826
- And on top of this brand new car,

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:07.893
you also won

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.228
$10,000 in cash.

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.062
- Yeah.

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:10.896
- Yeah, so congratulations.

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:11.731
- Thank you so much.
(explosion)

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:12.765
- Lincoln!

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:14.133
This is literally

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:15.167
half a million dollars
(cash register dings)

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:16.535
in one dollar bills.

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:17.369
Do you wanna get inside of it?

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:18.204
Cause it's all yours.

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:19.438
