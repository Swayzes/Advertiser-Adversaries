00:00:01.156 --> 00:00:03.823
(upbeat music)

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.390
- All right, so this is Apple's brand new,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.120
latest and greatest iPhone 15.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.790
And nothing inside is new

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.440
or anything that we haven't seen before

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.030
in some other phone somewhere.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.520
Now that doesn't mean
it's not a good phone.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.360
You can actually be a really
good phone and not really new,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.068
they aren't mutually exclusive.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.600
And it turns out,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.990
that is actually Apple's
strategy with this phone.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.860
The more I use this phone,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.110
the more I see Apple's textbook,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.380
late mover advantage strategy
coming into play here.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.340
They're gonna take something

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.160
we've literally already seen before

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.350
and then do it the Apple way.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.700
So on the outside, let's see,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.910
how would I describe
this new phone's design?

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.620
Kind of familiar, I don't know,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.990
somewhat reminiscent of the 14.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.880
How does Apple say it?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.647
- iPhone 15 has an all new
design that's simply gorgeous.

00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:09.840
- All new?

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.883
All new? Really?

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.970
Okay, I mean, I don't know about all new

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.210
but this phone definitely
inherits the same looks

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.850
and general design as last year again.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.170
But you know what's at least partially new

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.640
is actually the way it feels in the hand.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.260
So I said this in the 15 Pro review,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.870
but they've done a good job
softening the corners here.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.350
So it still looks boxy,
still has aluminum rails,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.730
but it's more comfortable to hold,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.560
since these corners aren't as sharp,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.060
they're a little bit rounded off.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.730
And then, this is also
the first glass-backed,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.970
non-Pro iPhone with a satin back,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.800
and I am loving the satin back,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.640
this is like a nice, soft
touch, frosted glass back here.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.950
I know there's a super
complicated process too

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.190
to like get this single
piece of glass on the back

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.870
to be two different colors

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.730
and two different
thicknesses and all that,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.980
and I can totally respect it.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.250
But honestly, the colors,
they are super weak.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.117
People were saying in the last video

00:02:03.117 --> 00:02:04.920
the the color grading must be off,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.540
it looks like it's white instead of blue.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.990
No, this blue phone really
doesn't look that blue at all

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.630
in almost any lighting, it's like 1% blue.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.130
But either way, you can say between

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.440
the aluminum and the pale light colors,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.730
these are also probably

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.550
the most fingerprint
resistant iPhones in years.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.500
On the sides, same button placements,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.110
same speakers placements,
same mute switch,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.060
no action button on this phone.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.530
Honestly, you could probably use

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.950
an iPhone 14 case on the iPhone 15.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.530
But around the front, new screen,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.330
well, not new, again, but new
to this iPhone, new screen.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.946
You now get the dynamic island

00:02:40.946 --> 00:02:43.050
on the non-Pro iPhones this year,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.580
which is very much doing

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.470
the whole punch cutout the Apple way.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.630
So the notch is finally dead

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.380
until maybe a new iPhone SE
brings it back, it could happen.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.320
But also, slowly, app developers
have been getting on board

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.187
in useful ways over the past year.

00:02:57.187 --> 00:02:58.860
I already have a few favorites now,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.740
my airline app's giving
me real-time flight info,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.680
my weather apps, Uber, et cetera.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.670
But while we're up here

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.950
talking about the screen on
this phone, it's also brighter,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.730
It's up to 2,000 knits now,
which looks awesome outdoors.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.450
But also, it's 2023,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.450
and this is an $800 phone that
still has a 60 hertz display.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.870
This is actually really fascinating to me.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.710
It's so odd.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.543
Like, on one hand,

00:03:26.543 --> 00:03:28.950
for most people buying this
phone, it's totally fine.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.620
It literally doesn't have,
it's a new baseline iPhone,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.940
have you talked to someone who
buys a new baseline iPhone?

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.960
They literally don't care.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.950
It doesn't matter,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.240
it's not something they pay attention to,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.080
you could ask them right now

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.790
how many frames per second their phone is

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.950
and they wouldn't have an
answer, just doesn't matter.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.000
So just as long as it works

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.310
and it's all relatively
smooth like last year

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.140
and the year before and the year before,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.120
it's totally a non-factor.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.750
I have actually literally
handed 120 hertz phone to people

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.760
next to a 60 hertz phone,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.010
and even side by side next to each other,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.480
they can't see the difference.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.950
Or if they do, it's just like,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.200
oh, that's a subtle thing
that seems kind of neat

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.270
but they'd be totally
fine missing out on it.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.830
So with the target
demographic of this phone,

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.730
it's totally fine.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.230
But on the other hand, Apple,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.770
the richest technology
company in the world,

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.560
does stuff all the time

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.500
that regular people will
literally never notice,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.290
that are subtle improvements
or changes here and there,

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.123
all the time.

00:04:26.123 --> 00:04:27.870
Like, when they switched
these baseline iPhones

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.300
from LCD to OLED displays,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.490
do you think any of these
people actually noticed that?

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.710
Or what about going from
the A15 Bionic last year

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.150
to this A16 Bionic?

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.310
Do you think people are actually noticing

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.210
the differences here?

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.150
Or what about when they
just added 5G to the iPhone

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.340
and most people didn't care?

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.740
Like, making subtle improvements over time

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.440
is what modern smartphones
are all about these days.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.670
And I would actually argue that

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.800
a higher refresh rate is more noticeable

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.680
to more people than some
of those other things.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.740
Like, I think you could today
hand me, a professional,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.820
an unlabeled iPhone with an
A15 Bionic and an A16 Bionic,

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.860
and it would take me quite some time

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.260
to find the real differences between them.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.820
And so, that combined with the fact

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.180
that it's incredibly cheap
and easy and reasonable

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.610
to get to like at least a 90 hertz phone,

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.117
isn't the new Moto G is
like 90 hertz at $170

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.150
or something like that?

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.890
Now I'm sure that's a
horrible looking screen

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.970
compared to this iPhone,

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.660
it's 720P with the brightness
of a box of crayons.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.170
But still they decided
to add that to that phone

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.750
because Motorola knew that
enough people would notice it

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.420
and feel that smoothness difference

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.330
and it's a higher level
of perceived performance.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.380
So it's just wild to me,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.290
knowing how easy it would
be for Apple to make this

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.070
even a 90 hertz display, but
they just refuse to do it

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.730
because they've attached the
word Pro to that feature.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.670
It's promotion for the Pro phones.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.320
And it just strikes me as a tool

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.050
just to sort of continue widening the gap

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.570
as much as they can
between the Pro iPhones

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.060
and the non-Pro iPhones,
and they're happy to do it,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.460
even if it makes this iPhone 15

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.160
the most expensive phone in the world

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.480
with a 60 hertz display.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.760
Anyway, speaking of widening that gap,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.690
the Pro phones this year also
got a brand new A17 Pro chip

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.530
but this iPhone 15 gets
last year's A16 Bionic

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.460
from the 14 Pro.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.230
Honestly, the renaming of the Pro chip

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.460
might be the most interesting part

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.900
because it implies that

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.480
it's definitely not going to trickle down

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.760
to the baseline phone next year.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.710
But either way, this A16 bionic here

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.620
is more than good enough
in a phone of this price,

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.440
as far as performance and
handling everyday tasks

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.470
and gaming and flying
around iOS at 60 hertz.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.710
And the one thing you definitely
can argue for 60 hertz

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.120
would be battery life,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.490
because despite all the
issues floating around,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.680
the battery life on these
phones has been pretty good.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.513
So I don't know if you saw it,

00:06:50.513 --> 00:06:52.530
but Apple has officially now addressed

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.960
the heat and battery
issues that some people,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.230
including myself, have been
reporting with these iPhones.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.970
So an iOS update is coming

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.100
and it seems like some
specific third party apps,

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.200
like Instagram, were also having issues

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.090
and those should be getting updates too.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.970
But on average, the battery life on my 15

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.933
has been better than my
battery on the 15 Pro.

00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:13.770
And the 15 Plus looks to have

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.870
the best battery life ever on any iPhone,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.950
which is really promising.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.300
So that combination of the
A16 Bionic, which is not new,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.330
and 60 hertz screens, which are not new,

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.620
are giving you great battery life.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.380
Also, USB-C is definitely not new

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.590
but here it is alongside all
the benefits that come with it,

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.260
from using the same cable
to charge everything,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.120
to plugging into more accessories,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.180
like monitors and keyboards
and all kinds of other stuff.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.610
It is sad that the older chip does mean

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.050
there's no USB 3 controller

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.080
so there are no USB 3 data
speeds, it's still slow,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.610
but honestly, unless you're using

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.140
the Pro iPhone's camera features,

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.910
there's almost nobody
here buying this phone

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.130
that's gonna actually need
fast data transfer anyway

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.050
so I guess you can give it a pass.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.630
And they managed to do
it in the Apple way too.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.050
They color matched the
inside of the USB-C port

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.150
with the color of the
phone, and they actually,

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:03.983
I don't know if you've seen this,

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:07.800
they print the model
number inside the port.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.240
So Apple really loves hiding this

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.500
in the most discreet way possible.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.790
You know, I should really
gives some appreciation

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.580
to some of the clever software
features on the iPhone 15

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.430
because you could actually
consider them new.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.770
So they added stuff like
an ultra-wideband chip

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.470
so you can find your phone
more easily with an Apple Watch

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.277
or be found on Find My
Friends, that's new.

00:08:25.277 --> 00:08:28.080
They also added these clever audio effects

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.480
and video effects at an OS level,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.220
so they work inside of any app.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.530
So you can be on a phone
call or a video call

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.450
or a Google Meet or Zoom or whatever,

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.360
and flip on the background
noise cancellation

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.270
and it works really shockingly well,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.620
it's very, very good.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.570
So I'm on a phone call with myself,

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.400
this is what it'll sound
like to be in a room

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.253
with the dishwasher
running, the HVAC going,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.980
and the sink going right next to me,

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.540
right next to the microphone.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.790
When I switch the mic from Standard mode

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.503
to Voice Isolation mode,

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.090
even though all the same
noises are still happening,

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.550
it does a much better
job of just picking out

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.410
specifically my voice,

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.380
really smart and it's genuinely new.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.330
There's also some other not so new stuff,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.450
like they just now added
downloadable offline areas

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.687
to Apple Maps and interactable widgets,

00:09:18.687 --> 00:09:22.110
and they finally added an
80% battery charge limiter

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.010
in the settings.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.540
So you can check out all this stuff,

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.360
I did a full video on the iOS 17 update

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.680
at the link below that like button,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.660
if you wanna watch that, you
should definitely check it out

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.980
after you watch this video.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.990
What I will say is one of
the most liked features

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.750
I talked about in that
video is Standby mode.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.760
And on the Pro iPhone, when
you put it on a charger,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.280
turn it sideways, it keeps the screen on

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.340
which it can do because
it goes to one Hertz,

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.370
it's an LTPO display, and it's
fine staying on like that.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.880
But on the non-Pro iPhone,
which does not have LTPO,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.600
it's basically locked at I
think either 30 or 60 hertz,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.030
either way it doesn't drop to one Hertz.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.800
So Apple just decides,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.170
we'll turn off the screen
after a little bit,

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.003
which kind of feels like it

00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:03.300
defeats the purpose of this feature,

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.000
so then you have to nudge the
table or or bump the stand

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.250
to wake it up like an Apple Watch charger.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.450
Just a notable difference

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.874
between the Pro and non-Pro iPhones.

00:10:11.874 --> 00:10:13.560
But last but not least,

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.560
these new cameras are actually
weird, but in a good way.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.700
So iPhone 15 has been upgraded

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.220
to a new set of 12 megapixel ultra wide

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.040
and the new 48 megapixel main camera.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.510
It's not the same sensor as the Pro,

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.650
it's actually slightly smaller,

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.610
but it has a larger max aperture
of F1.6 to make up for it.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.860
And then, it's also
doing a combo of binning

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.360
and detailed transfer to give you

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.500
this new 24 megapixel photo
as a result by default.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.120
Now, if you were paying attention before,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.070
you'll remember that this new iPhone

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.970
has the exact same chip
as last year's Pro iPhone.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.540
Same processing cores, same
image signal processor,

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.140
same neural engine, same
A16 Bionic, same everything.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.610
So why is this new 24 megapixel default

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.610
only coming to the newest iPhone
15 and not last year's Pro?

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.520
Like, I still have last year's Pro phone

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.080
and I've updated it to the latest software

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.610
and it does not get this feature,

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.350
it's still shooting 12 megapixels.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.460
So honestly now my base iPhone
15's non-zoomed in photos

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.260
are actually looking a little better,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.110
a little more detailed than
last year's Pro phones.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.000
And then, there's the new

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.330
auto-Portrait Mode detection
feature, which is pretty sweet.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.970
Basically you don't have
to switch to Portrait Mode

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.090
to take a photo that captures
all of the depth information

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.940
that allows you to turn it into
a Portrait Mode photo later.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.570
So as long as you're pointing
the camera at a human subject

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.890
or a cat or a dog as identified
by the neural engine,

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.490
or if you tap to focus, you
automatically get this little F

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.780
at the bottom corner of the screen,

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.340
which means it's capturing the data needed

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.440
for Portrait Mode, just in case.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.060
And so, then, later, if you decide,

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.400
eh, I actually do want this
to be a Portrait Mode shot,

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.660
you go into your gallery

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.000
and just make it a Portrait Mode photo,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.460
that you can even then go
in and edit and play with.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.600
Some people have been describing it

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.150
as being able to change
the focus point later.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.830
It's not exactly doing that,

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.600
you can't like save something

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.850
that was out of focus by bringing it back.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.770
But basically, for the classic iPhone shot

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.320
where it kind of looks like
everything is in focus,

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.805
then, yeah, you can
play with Portrait Mode

00:12:14.805 --> 00:12:16.440
and get really good results.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.990
Last year's Pro iPhone has the same chip,

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.270
also has a 48 megapixel main camera

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.220
and has the same neural engine,

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.978
doesn't get this feature, for some reason.

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:27.150
Also kind of weird.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.710
So look, with these reviews,

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.480
we always make a lot of judgements

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.680
about what we think the
typical iPhone buyer is,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.530
what they actually care
about, what they'll notice,

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.260
what they will appreciate
about a new phone.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.500
And with this one, I do
feel like they've stacked up

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.810
enough of these subtle improvements,

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.190
that even though it looks the same

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.280
and there's not really that
much that's actually new here,

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.480
they've at least stacked enough things

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.700
that it feels like an
appreciably better phone.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.700
So my verdict is, if
you have an iPhone 14,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.460
you don't have to upgrade,
of course, even a 13 maybe.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.050
But if you have an older phone

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.790
and you're looking to
upgrade to a new iPhone,

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.537
every year, I always
get friends asking like,

00:13:04.537 --> 00:13:07.110
"Oh, should I just get the older,

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.780
like last year's iPhone
to save some money?"

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.860
And no, I actually wouldn't,

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.110
I would say just get the iPhone 15.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.250
There's enough new changes here,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.370
it's a better phone in
every way and it's also USB.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.470
Like, you don't buy a base iPhone

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.210
to get the bleeding edge of tech,

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.070
you buy it just 'cause
it works and it's fine

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.298
and it's gonna be familiar and
work for the next few years.

00:13:25.298 --> 00:13:26.850
And just knowing that you're gonna have it

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:27.683
for the next few years,

00:13:27.683 --> 00:13:29.670
I would not recommend
buying a Lightning iPhone

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.130
as we just moved everything forward

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.770
into the world of USB type C.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.900
Just get the new one, just
grab the boring new iPhone

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.410
with nothing that's actually that new.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.880
It's just gonna work.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.450
That's it, thanks for watching,
catch you in the next one.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.322
Peace.

00:13:46.322 --> 00:13:48.989
(upbeat music)
