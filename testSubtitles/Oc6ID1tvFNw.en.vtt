00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
The G Pro Superlite is one of the best gaming mice ever,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.920
and it comes from Logitech,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.460
one of the most trusted names in computer peripherals,

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.840
which got us thinking,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.400
what if you bought everything from Logitech?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.440
It might look a little something like this.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.880
So we're gonna find out where brand loyalty gets you,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.440
to the ultimate gaming setup

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.100
or to a pile of overpriced trendy plastic.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.100
Starting with their G715 wireless gaming keyboard.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.140
It's got the works,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.820
wireless connectivity via Bluetooth

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.620
or with their included 2.4 gigahertz dongle

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.820
that docks in the back.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.980
Your choice of Logitech,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.460
which apparently means long,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.180
Hua, clicky, linear or tactile switches,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.300
full RGB backlighting and macro keys,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.780
which if you press them,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.040
they can do anything,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.540
like segue to our sponsor.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.660
The Ridge, upgrade your everyday carry

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.900
with the Ridge wallet.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.540
It's RFID blocking technology

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.660
protects your cars from digital theft,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.020
while it's durable materials,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.220
ensure it lasts for years to come.

and get free shipping.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.980
One other cool thing I didn't notice

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.020
before the sponsor break

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.420
was that you can customize it

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.180
with these interchangeable faceplates.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.020
Love to see it.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.000
Now let's make some room on this desk

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.980
and check out their mouse pad.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.220
Really, we're gonna take an LTT desk pad

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.540
off the desk to replace it with,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.740
fine, fine, let's do it.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.180
Wow.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.820
What'd you drop?

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.900
Nothing.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.040
See you later, quality LTT merchandise.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.680
Say hello to Logitech merchandise.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.980
It's a great color.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.900
How much is this thing?

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.220
It's more expensive than ours, it's $40.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.860
Huh, this is expensive, metallic ink,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.320
probably natural rubber backing material though,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.860
it's not going anywhere.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.100
All they're really missing is the stitched edge.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.100
You can't deny our setup so far looks good,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.540
I forgot to mention they included cloud wrist rest,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.260
but man, that's expensive.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.820
We spent $240 so far

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.380
and that does not include the monitor.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.940
And they aren't about to get cheaper.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.500
The Logitech PowerPlay is a mouse pad

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.420
slash wireless charging system

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.820
that costs $120 US dollars.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.940
Though, in spite of that,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.700
I am a huge fan of this thing.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.860
This is what Apple AirPower wishes

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.940
it could have grown up to be.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.580
You plug in this little module at the top,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.940
it comes with either a cloth surface

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.620
or a hard surface,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.380
or you can just BYO and stick it

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.800
under your existing desk pad

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.220
or as we've done in the past,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.320
embed the flipping thing in your desk.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.060
Then you take this little puck,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.620
install it in your recent Logitech mouse

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.940
and your mouse just continuously charges

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.460
while you're gaming.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.020
Never charge, never plug in again,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.220
I flipping love these things.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.300
Of course, we're gonna need a mouse to put it in.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.220
And we're gonna need so many dongles.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.980
One fewer than you think.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.180
The PowerPlay actually has a receiver in it.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.020
Oh.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.620
So I will not need that dongle.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.460
Cool.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.300
Except I will.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.120
Oh.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.120
To get the mouse working at all

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.220
and then I'll pair it to the PowerPlay later.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.740
Oh, Logitech Pro Superlight 2.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.460
I haven't actually tried this one yet.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.300
Wait, this is-

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.120
Can you tell much of a difference?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.960
Where's the two?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.800
That is the two.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.620
That's the two?

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.460
It just says Pro Superlight.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.300
They didn't even bother redoing the mold.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.660
No, they did redo the mold.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.340
It now goes in the other direction,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.940
but they didn't put a two on it.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.860
Yeah, I don't know.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.220
It says on the box.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.100
In all seriousness though,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.900
there are improvements over the original.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.140
It now goes to 32,000 DPI

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.340
and it's just 60 grams instead of 63,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.020
a savings that will almost certainly be negated

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.560
by the extra weight of the charging puck.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.060
But somehow they still increase the battery life to 90 hours.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.900
Wow.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.980
Yeah, about a 33% increase.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.820
That's great,

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.100
because I'm gonna spend 33% of my time

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.740
looking for this mouse on this mouse pad.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.060
How will I find it?

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.660
It's a strange fate that we should pay so dear a price

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.420
for something so small and light, $160,

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.940
which puts our total so far up to?

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.000
510.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.840
Wow.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.940
We haven't even turned on the computer yet.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.620
We don't have a computer yet.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.240
Oh, okay, sure.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.460
I mean, let's clarify,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.780
Logitech doesn't make computers.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.060
Yeah, Logitech doesn't make computers,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.060
so that's not their fault.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.340
What they do make is chairs,

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.380
which I don't have yet,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.180
but I do have this headset.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.980
This is the Pro X2 Lightspeed.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.300
Is this chair in the shot?

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.140
Is...

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.460
Editor, blur that.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.740
Editor, blur the chair.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.780
There's a lot to like here, though.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.900
They use their Graphene Technology 50 millimeter drivers.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.940
They have a steel headband and they have aluminum.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.260
Where's the aluminum?

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.100
Somewhere.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.920
I have one of the older ones

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.700
and I do like the on-ear cup controls.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.940
You've got a power button,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.940
a volume wheel with a little block

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.540
so you don't accidentally hit it too often,

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.060
mic mute, USB-C for charging,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.300
and a Bluetooth pairing button

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.860
in case you wanna switch over to Bluetooth

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.540
from the default dongle mode,

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.220
which, oh, that's cool,

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.380
has a three and a half millimeter jack on it.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.380
Mine's black, so it's possible it has it

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.220
and I never noticed.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.740
I actually don't know.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.420
The boom mic is detachable and replaceable.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.540
They have upgraded ones

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.660
and the blue audio actually sounds quite nice.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.300
This is an audio test on the Pro X2 Lightspeed.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.380
Oh, and in addition to the leatherette ear cups,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.820
they include these fabric ones that they call velour,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.400
but I think that's being very generous.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.220
About as generous as you'll be being to Logitech

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.980
when you buy these because they cost,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.860
I believe, 250 US dollars?

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.700
Correct.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.660
Yeah.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.700
Yeah, they do.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.740
Maybe you could give me something more affordable here

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.580
for the people.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.400
Oh, mic covers for gaming head.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.580
Ha ha ha.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.580
In case that one you have on is too boring.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.740
Is this a real product?

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.260
Yeah, it's 9.99 US.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.580
I mean, it's the right price.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.940
I mean, I also wash dishes with this type of fabric.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.780
There you go.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.620
Oh, that looks way better.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.940
I just spent $10 on a piece of purple foam.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.420
Well, no, you got all the colors.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.180
But what if you don't wanna listen to headphones?

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.580
Oh, did you just put that on the keyboard?

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.420
It's fine.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.700
I put it gently on the keyboard.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.580
Sheesh.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.500
Logitech used to be the king

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.700
when it came to PC speaker setups

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.380
after Klipsch pulled out of the market and so did Creative.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.940
Nowadays, now that there's no competition,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.740
yeah, this feels noticeably less robust

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.700
than their older stuff, but it's something.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.140
What the heck is this?

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.580
Look at this.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.420
Oh, good.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.820
Proprietary interfaces.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.660
Wait a second.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.020
The left and the right are different.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.100
Are you kidding me, Logitech?

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.900
Don't do that.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.240
Just use speaker wire, guys.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.540
That way I can sub it out with any length I want.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.320
Where am I gonna find this extension?

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.160
Oh, yeah.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.840
And the controls are all on the right speaker.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.220
It's got your power button, a headphone out,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.660
Bluetooth pairing, as well as volume up and down,

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.820
and then a mystery button.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.780
G.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.020
Oh, that's probably for the RGB.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.020
Makes you a G gamer.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.500
Activating gamer lights.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.180
Wow.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.220
Woo!

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.260
That explains the custom cable.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.280
Totally justified.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.340
Yeah, there's no port in the world

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.300
that can send both an audio and RGB signal at all.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.820
It's impossible.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.960
I mean, there's this one.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.340
Well, yeah, Logitech finally made it.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.980
That's why these are so expensive.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.060
What are they worth?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.740
Well, about $200.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.820
Two hundos.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.460
Cheaper than your headset.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.260
We're at almost $1,000.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.120
Yeah, and we're not even started.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.920
Of course, most people don't wanna be tied

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.140
to their desk for audio,

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.640
and that's where the Ultimate Ears Hyperboom comes in.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.300
Logitech acquired these guys a number of years back,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.780
and this is their flagship Bluetooth speaker,

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.900
which is rated at plus, plus, plus,

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.620
plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus,

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.620
sound intensity, and a range of 45 meters

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.700
with IPX4 water resistance.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.900
Wow.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.080
And if one isn't enough,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.360
you can pair two of them to the same device

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.740
and play the audio through both of them.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.540
They call it party mode.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.140
I think that has a name already.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.260
It's called stereo.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.100
No.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.340
Party mode, baby.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.760
Is that max volume?

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.420
What did you do?

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.420
I'm pressing volume up and it's doing this.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.940
Oh, it's at max volume.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.260
You know what?

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.420
If you want loud speakers,

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.220
they get pretty loud.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.300
But for $450 each?

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.140
Yeah.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:34.780
That's tough.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.300
Do we have anything really cool to pivot to?

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.140
Yes.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.140
These Mevo cameras are absolutely stunning.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.540
They're crazy.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.140
What they are is they're a bunch of wireless cameras

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.860
that can stream independently to a single source.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.600
So you can have multi-cam streams.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.020
They're all battery powered.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.100
Oh, super cool.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:51.940
Yeah.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.540
1080p, 30 FPS.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.420
USB-C charging.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.780
And we have the iPad and stuff.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.340
Colin was showing me these to me yesterday

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.380
and I was absolutely blown away by them.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.500
Wow, that's pretty cool.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.340
Boop, boop.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.980
Yeah, you don't want to point them into the light though.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.500
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.260
And the third one is the batteries.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.620
And the lights on the front will show you

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.460
who's recording.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.380
Oh, red light, super cool.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.220
So when you're doing a multi-cam stream or something,

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.460
you'll be able to like know

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.620
that you've switched camera angles.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.180
Yeah, so my Twitch stream could be called

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.540
the red light district.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.540
Yeah.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.460
There are some caveats.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.380
While they do have native support for OBS,

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.460
it supports only one camera.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.060
So if you want to do the whole switching thing,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.740
you have to use the iPad app and they're,

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.020
well, they're $1,000.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.860
Next up.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.940
Before we move on,

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.980
those cameras can actually run off of these devices as well.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.860
Ethernet power adapter.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.340
Okay, this kind of makes sense.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.620
If you have a PoE network switch,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.940
then you can just use the USB port here

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.220
to power your camera.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.740
Yeah, and then you don't need to run off Wi-Fi.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.580
Yeah.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.820
Yeah, they're 200 US each.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.180
Huh.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.620
Can you use another USB-C dongle

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.700
and just do pass through power and ethernet that way?

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.780
If you don't need PoE?

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.820
I don't know.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.300
I didn't test that,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.900
but this was what was on the device

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.940
as an essential kit for these cameras.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.580
They are a kind of unique product.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.580
USB-C to the camera, right?

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.780
That's straightforward enough.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.500
Then it can take a PoE power input,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.400
also handle networking over this jack,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.820
or take a non-PoE input

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.500
and then also plug in a USB-C power source

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.780
to power the camera.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.900
I don't see any reason

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.100
why you couldn't use a regular dongle for this though.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.180
I think we should try it right now.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.300
I will go find a dongle.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.140
I have one in my backpack.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.960
I have one as well.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.800
Oh, perfect, okay.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.060
Let's see who can get their dongle first.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.300
The alliance is already there.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.260
It is immediately charging.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.740
So that's good.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.820
Why is this on here?

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.660
What is this?

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.500
Whose iPad is this?

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.700
This is my personal iPad.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.740
No, thank you.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.740
It's a, they're stream overlays.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.740
Oh, I see.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.740
Well, that's very useful.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.940
Oh, that's a weird spot for you to come out of.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.740
Unfortunately, there's no obvious way

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.100
to disconnect from wifi once you're connected.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.500
So we're not sure what we're on,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.180
but the good news is there's a help article we found

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.660
that talks all about using ethernet only adapters

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.960
or ethernet adapters with USB power delivery.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.220
So it seems like it's supported,

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.260
but there are some caveats.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.700
Let's talk about these mics.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.500
I call them the microphone and the coal ball

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.900
because they acquired blue.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.940
Rest in peace, blue.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.660
You dabba dee dabba died.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.740
This is an audio test on the Yeti Orb.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.860
This is an audio test on the Yeti GX.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.980
I'm kind of feeling the Orb.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.980
I like this nice little tripod stand

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.180
and it kind of sits exactly where I need it.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.020
That's good.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.020
It's $90 cheaper than this one.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.260
This one is 60 and this one is 150.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.540
But before you make a decision,

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.980
could I interest you in third microphone?

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.500
Oh, this feels very expensive.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.400
This body is either cast or machined aluminum.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.700
Oh.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
XLR input, base cut and presence.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.340
This is an audio test on the Blue Sona.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.580
Whoa, look at this thing.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.020
This has got to be at least 300 US dollars.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.860
Bang on baby, 300 US.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.700
Yeah.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.540
Nice.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.700
Then you need an arm for it and an XLR interface.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.820
Better sound really good.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.300
Hey, an arm.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.140
Oh, it's coming out of a not normal arm place,

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.100
but it's a nice little arm.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.920
Nice, but good job.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.420
We're gonna go with the Sona,

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.340
but in an unfortunate turn of events,

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.260
Logitech has no XLR interface.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.940
Fortunately, they have this accessory for the Sona,

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.500
which shows you how I feel about that.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.220
Built-in cable management jobbies.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.620
This is kind of nice.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.340
It retails for 100 US normally.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.020
I've seen it as low as 40 US

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.740
when Best Buy is just trying to clear them out.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.840
That's something to note about all of this stuff,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.900
by the way, is Logitech is one of those brands

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.640
where there's the MSRP and then there's the P you pay.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.660
What?

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.480
The P you pay?

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.320
The price you pay?

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.160
Price you pay.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.980
Oh gosh, okay.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.820
This is really coming together.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.180
What's our total, Eli?

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.820
Our total is actually 3,860 US right now.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.740
Wait, is that with all the microphones?

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.340
No, that is just with our select microphone right now.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.100
We did double up with like $900 of speaker though.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.620
Right, plus this as well.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.700
So like $1,100 of speaker.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.060
I would say they're not really $1,100 worth of speaker,

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.900
but that's how much the MSRP is.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.180
Apparently Logitech actually makes

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.340
a lot of different key lights.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.980
They have three different ones on their store

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.300
with the smallest one here.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.820
All USB powered.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.960
It's actually got all the buttons on the back,

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.380
including the power, the brightness,

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.020
and the temperature of the light.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.820
And it just has a little monitor mount.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.340
Turn it on, boom.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.260
We got another key light that's the same thing, but wide.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.540
It's a wide boy.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.460
Alrighty, Logitech.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.500
Ah, Logitech Ray 6.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.020
Ow.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.380
Oh, that's like solid metal right on my toe.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.220
Yeah, it's cool.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.100
This thing's like a stow and go racing sim.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.200
So if you hit these little hooks here.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.980
Oh.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.380
You can just fold her up

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.740
and then put her away for convenient storage.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.820
Oh, that's really cool actually.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.740
High wife approval factor.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.600
This arm here where the wheel sits on,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.980
you can actually just have this little lock here.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:07.820
So you can get in and out.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:08.660
Yo.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.780
Yeah.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.740
That's pretty neat.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.140
There you go.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.180
Yeah.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.180
Honestly, I think it's pretty comfortable.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.020
I would hope so.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.640
It's 300 US.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.480
It's kind of expensive.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.300
That's not that bad.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.140
Really?

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.500
I think that's expensive for like fabric

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.180
and some steel tubes.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.460
Yeah, but it's also specially shaped steel tubes.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.300
I guess.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.780
It seems reasonable in the grand scheme of sim racing stuff,

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.620
especially if you look at how much the other stuff costs.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.460
That's true.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.980
Wheel.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.020
That's really big.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.360
That box is huge.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.180
Oh God.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.340
And then here are the foot pedals.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.180
Oh yeah.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.100
How are the foot pedals lighter than the,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.340
you think the foot pedals would be a little bit heavier

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.460
because you want to have a weight on them.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.360
Well, this is going to have like the feedback force motor

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.260
and stuff, right?

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.100
Oh, that's good.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.180
That's going to be in there.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.540
So you got a triple pedal setup.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.380
You got your brake,

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.300
you got your gas and you got your clutch.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.960
You have an adjustable load on the brake

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.300
as well as swappable springs.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.760
If you want a little bit more push

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.580
or a little bit less for your pedals.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.660
I am loving the lighting set up here,

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.160
but what did it cost?

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.660
This one was 50 US.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.200
This one is a hundred US.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.500
This one is 150 US.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.820
And this is the RGB one.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.640
Correct.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.640
It's got an RGB backing to it.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.780
So you can, you know, cast it on the wall,

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.300
get the ambiance.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.360
Oh, come on.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.740
Undecided.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.820
What does that put our total at?

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.980
And when are we going to take it to the next level

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.380
with the Logitech GX?

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.020
Carmen Miller, chair.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.860
Well, our current total without the chair.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.740
You go at him, you're just, you're crouching there.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.580
I'm not taking it.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.420
I got you.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.260
No, I don't want it.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.080
No, I got you.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.920
It's really expensive.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.740
Please don't break it.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.580
You got it?

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.420
You got it?

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.240
Yeah, okay.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.080
Okay.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.920
Good Lord.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.740
Okay, you're doing great.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.580
That's like the worst way to do that.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.420
Here, I'll come help you.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.240
I'll help, I'll help.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.080
I got you, I got you.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.920
Oh, Jesus.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.740
Here, have a seat.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.580
Have a seat, buddy.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.420
Thank you so much.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.240
How kind.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.620
So we were at 4,800 already.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.900
4,100, he didn't let me finish my sentence.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.100
Ah, and this is gonna add another...

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.880
2,600 Canadian dollars.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.260
Yeah, these things are nuts.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.900
Does your butt feel like an oil prince right now?

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.420
Honestly, I prefer their $1,000 chair,

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.980
their Aeron chairs, but wow, it's pretty good.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.460
They do sell a cheaper Herman Miller chair,

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.300
like with Logitech.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.260
It's a really good chair.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.460
I sit at one of my desks and it's lovely.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.020
The reviews are great.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:41.860
Yeah.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.180
Oh yeah, four and a half stars.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.740
There is one key thing missing from our setup here.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.160
First of all, how much did I spend on this,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.580
admittedly, pretty upgraded wheel

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.580
since I bought my G27 back in the day?

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.140
Just the wheel is 1,000 US.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:56.980
What?

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.340
Yes, it's 1,000 US.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.900
I remember Alex talking to me

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.500
about how the pricing of this thing

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.940
has basically gone up and up and up.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.500
The whole kit was hundreds of dollars,

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.460
including the pedals and the shifter.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.660
So the pedals are just 350 now.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.140
What do you mean just 350?

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.020
You have to pay $1,000 for the wheel.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.060
I mean, on their own, they're 350.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.660
Whoa.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.060
Yeah, it's gone up a lot.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.380
And the play seat?

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.940
$300.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.660
That's pretty reasonable, I think.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.300
Yeah, I think it's pretty reasonable

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.140
for what you're getting.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.820
I think it's insanely overpriced.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.900
I mean, yeah, compared to like a, you know,

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.700
plastic picnic chair. A lawn chair, yeah.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.220
Sure, but it's, I don't know.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.420
You sell a million lawn chairs,

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.420
you sell like 20 of these.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.940
There's molding costs and stuff, you know?

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.140
Okay.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.340
Yeah, and this folds up nicely,

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.340
so you can tuck it away.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.060
There are more affordable ones, to be very clear,

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.260
but it doesn't seem outlandish,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.460
like this $1,000 wheel.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.940
So just what you're sitting in is $1,650.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.340
So the lights just don't work when I'm in-game.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.340
They just turn off?

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.340
Yeah, like watch, I'll alt-tab.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.060
This is probably a feature

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.100
that we probably need to configure or something.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.780
And credit where credit's due,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.100
everything's in their software

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.020
and all easily accessible and controllable.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.660
I just don't know why the lights turn off.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.500
Okay.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.740
Oh, wow.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.540
Wow, I really feel like I'm driving.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.540
The wheel feels stronger and smoother than the old ones.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.780
I think Alex may not have given them quite enough credit

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.620
for the upgrades that they've made to this over the years.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.240
I think there's just that a lot of competitors

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.380
just destroy them on price.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.760
Like the Moza Racing stuff is pretty good and much cheaper.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.180
I think feels more premium.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.300
Well, we've seen that pattern a lot today.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.140
Yeah.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:38.980
Ah!

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:39.800
Oh, ow.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.640
Oh.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.020
That looks really aggressive.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.060
Pretty strong.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.940
Very strong compared to my old one.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.340
So credit where it's due,

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.660
it's better than it used to be,

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.660
but the price is just-

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.740
$1,000 is a lot.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.460
Not competitive with some of the really cool stuff

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.220
out there from smaller brands that focus on this stuff.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.260
Oh, good job.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.300
Oh yeah.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.900
And what if you don't want to sit at your desk?

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.420
Oh yeah.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.240
The Logitech G Cloud.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.080
Okay. In all seriousness,

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.420
I thought this thing was stupid when I first heard about it.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.780
I did a full review.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.660
It was, it's great.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.140
It's actually really cool.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.660
This is a totally valid alternative

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.760
to something like a PS Portal

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.740
because you can use the Sony app

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.460
to totally stream your PlayStation games

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.200
anywhere where you've got wifi.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.500
And you can also stream PC games

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.660
or you can just play Android games.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.100
The only thing I really didn't like

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.540
in my review of this thing

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.740
was that you have to agree to 10 cents terms of service

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.940
in order to use it.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.860
Cause it was done in collaboration with them.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.220
I don't know if that's the case anymore, but.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.140
Total damage.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.660
With everything that you have set up in front of you.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.500
Yes.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.020
$6,110.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.900
Not including the computer or the monitor or the desk.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.180
$6,110.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.320
It's not like anything is bad.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.160
Nope.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.740
It's just expensive.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.860
It's also surprisingly cohesive.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.700
That's true.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.600
The software does really work really well with games

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.780
and integration with the lights and all the other things.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.080
So you do have that going for you.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.480
Easy Recommend, when it's on promo,

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.880
gets a little tougher when it's at full price.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.720
Yeah.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.680
Reasonable conclusion?

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.520
I think that's pretty fair.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.360
I think so.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.240
Also $3,000 in chairs and racing sim stuff, so.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.280
And $3,000 in Segway to our sponsor.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.520
Rocket Money.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.740
You and I both know that you're not using

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.040
every streaming service you're subscribed to.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.960
Yet, they're still leeching money from your bank account.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.440
Rocket Money wants to help.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.180
They make canceling unwanted subscriptions easy.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.820
So there's no need to go digging around

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.360
in a bank statement to solve the mystery

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.440
of who or what is taking your money every month.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.600
One click, and just like that,

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.280
you can cancel all those services

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.360
that are bogging down your bank account.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.040
That means more money for your next rig upgrade.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.480
You can make that upgrade even easier

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.480
with Rocket Money's smart saving systems too,

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.080
where they deposit a set amount of money into your savings

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.600
as often as you'd like.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.200
Even better, they can negotiate any bills

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.520
that you might be overpaying for on your behalf,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.300
so you don't have to spend hours on hold

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.160
listening to static, but pretends to be music.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.920
So start saving today by downloading the app for free

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.200

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.480
or by clicking our link down below.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.760
There's two more items we missed.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.440
They're toque and camo.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.660
I don't even know what this is.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.440
I don't think it would break much wind,

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.440
but it is not thick enough to be a jacket.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.720
So what do they call it?

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.560
A jacket.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.400
Okay, cool.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.480
And how much are these?

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.760
The beanie is 25, the jacket is 50.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.600
Cool.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.420
If you guys enjoyed this video

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.560
and you want to see more products

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.020
that make more sense on promo,

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.600
why don't you check out the all alien wear build?

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.440
It's a good one.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.260
It's a good one.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.100
I'm in.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.560
How do I look with this over my head first?

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.400
You look like Hey Arnold.
