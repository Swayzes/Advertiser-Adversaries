00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.836
I have got to send a picture of this thing to my old boss.

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:09.709
Check it out, the NCIX sign PC is off the sorry piece of cardboard and on the wall.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.244
And guys, look at this thing.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:16.216
I mean, what a way to celebrate those formative years of my career at the computer store.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:19.152
And it's even super fast.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.620
Gah!

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.788
Hey, keep it down!

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.423
Future Linus!

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:27.560
If you ever want to get that thing, we got a lot of work to do over here.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:31.097
Justin did a great job with this MDF backboard.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.665
Ha, fun fact.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:37.670
He couldn't just use an NCIX logo to design it, since their signs and graphical assets

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.742
were all slightly different from each other, so it had to be painstakingly custom modeled

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:43.743
and cut.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:47.380
But now that the paint's dry, we are ready for final assembly.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.616
Oh my god, this looks awesome!

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.584
Awesome, like our sponsor.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:52.585
War Thunder.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:56.656
War Thunder is an action-packed and detail-packed vehicle combat game.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.657
You gotta have both.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:01.895
You can play free right now on PC and consoles at the link below.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:06.933
Since we started this project, basically everything about it has changed, starting with the motherboard.

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:10.170
We've gone with the B650i Aorus Ultra from Gigabyte.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.941
It might lack some of the nice-to-haves, like the abundance of ports and PCIe lanes that

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:22.215
you'd find with X670, but it features 20 gig USB and CPU overclocking, which the A620 lacks.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:27.353
This particular board also supports PCIe Gen 5, which is an optional feature of the

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:33.159
chipset, and uses 2.5 gig onboard networking, which is slower than what we used to use for

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.996
our workstations, but that was back when we were shooting at 8K.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:43.736
This should be enough for our modern 4K workflow, and if it's not, these handy M.2 network

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:48.141
cards are a great way to add 10 gig to an ITX board.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.679
Then for our CPU, we went with the Ryzen 7 7800X 3D.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:59.486
It might lag behind the 13700K or even the 7700X for non-gaming tasks, but it's still

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:06.860
a wicked-fast 8-core CPU, and it's very power-efficient thanks to its lower-rated TDP, which is critical

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.898
for a small form-factor build, which, okay, it's kind of a large computer, but it's gonna

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:14.400
be in a confined space, and that's gonna matter.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:18.605
Also, we have about eight of these left over from the recent video, where we bought a whack

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:25.411
of them to evaluate the variation in performance from chip to chip, so I grabbed one.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.914
By the way, that's a super cool video, and you're gonna wanna check it out.

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:32.685
On the subject of cool, figuring out how to cool this machine was a big challenge.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:37.657
We wanted all the major components mounted inside the letters, otherwise, how's it even

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:38.658
a signed PC?

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:42.295
It would just be a PC next to a sign.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:49.402
But we also wanted the finished install to be as clean as possible, so no gaping holes

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:52.238
in the sides of our letters for intake fans.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:59.279
So we settled on a two-pronged approach, water cooling and hope, water to carry away most

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:05.218
of the heat from the major components, like the CPU and the GPU, and then faith, along

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:08.821
with some teeny-tiny fans to remove the rest.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:14.127
Not a huge fan of the mounting on these velocity-squared blocks, but you can't fault the look.

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.596
Man, are they sexy.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:21.568
For storage, while this motherboard does support PCIe Gen 5 drives, which theoretically

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:28.408
are double the speed of Gen 4, in practice, that offers no perceivable benefit for daily

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:34.380
use, so I settled on a Crucial P5 Plus, since all I need is a decent drive, I don't even

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.418
really need a DRAM cache, that isn't going to immediately die.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:42.422
Almost everything that I work on is gonna be stored in the cloud or on one of our servers,

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:47.927
which is why networking speed is much more important to me than the speed of my SSD.

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:53.766
Another area where speed matters is memory, and we've gone with this Manta X Prism DDR5-6400

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.335
CL32 kit.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:04:00.473
6,000 to 6,400 megatransfers per second is still the sweet spot for AMD when it comes

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:05.612
to price to performance, and this kit is in that range.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.447
I don't know much else about it.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.448
Hopefully it works.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:13.519
Time to mount this boy, and how would I describe this build so far?

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.520
Exquisite?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.521
Exceptional?

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:16.522
Extraordinary?

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:26.799
But, unless I plan on running an iGPU, I still have more items to install, perhaps in the

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.234
next Letter Over.

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:32.272
The width of this Letter was a big challenge for us to overcome when we went looking for

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.640
a GPU.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.711
Even with water cooling, most modern cards are so tall that they won't fit in here once

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:45.318
you account for the foam for the mounting, even before you factor in that most GPU waterblocks

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:48.888
have the fittings attaching up here, so we needed something where the fittings go on

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:49.889
the back.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.527
Now, as a business machine for business, this GPU isn't gonna be doing a ton of heavy lifting,

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:59.399
but we needed to be able to handle playback of raw 4K footage without issue, high-quality

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:05.138
screen capture, and I do occasionally fire up a game or two just in case I need to quickly

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.608
check something out, for business reasons of course.

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:15.081
So we settled on this NVIDIA RTX 3070 collab card between ASUS and EK Waterblocks.

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:20.353
Now let's see, where should we put the power supply?

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:23.756
You see where I'm going with this, right?

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:29.195
Our original plan was to use a Silverstone SFX power supply that we had full-length cables

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:34.334
for, but unfortunately, during a test build, that ended up exploding in a most underwhelming

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:38.871
way, which probably had nothing to do with the amount of metal shavings around the workshop.

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:43.476
Thankfully, we had other options, and this white unit from Cooler Master actually might

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:49.082
help us reflect more light from the RGB strips that we're gonna be putting in later as well.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:54.420
It's a bit of a change from the Seasonic Focus PX850s that we usually use in our workstations,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.960
but it's a suitable SFX alternative, and with the correct number of washers, should install

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.961
just fine.

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:05.198
If you plan on getting one of these, by the way, keep an eye out for the badge on the

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:09.435
front of the box that says, 100% Japanese capacitors.

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:14.741
Version 1 lacks that badge, but more importantly, lacks proper fan control and can get kind

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:15.742
of loud.

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:20.113
Thankfully for us, we've got the Nipponsai Ichiban version, and we can attach it to our

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:24.617
backplate with the screws I showed you before, and actually, this cool 3D-printed mount that

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:27.954
I didn't show you before, but if you wanna check it out more closely, we're gonna have

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:35.428
it linked down below if you ever need to mount a power supply to a backplate for some reason.

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:40.700
Finally, we need the place to put the remainder of our liquid cooling parts.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.170
Okay, that one was not very good.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.543
Realistically, we could've gone for any size of EK's Quantum Kinetic Flat D5, so we went

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:53.279
with the 240mm version.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:59.018
It comes with a reliable D5 pump and gives us lots of room to route tubing.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:01.621
First to our radiator here on the other side.

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:06.659
Speaking of, before we put this in, we went with the EK Quantum Surface S360.

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:11.898
It uses copper fins and a balanced fin density for solid performance regardless of your

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:17.537
fan speed, which matters a lot more to us than usual because even though these Noctuas

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:22.675
spin at a decent speed, they are low-profile fans, so they have lower static pressure than

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:28.281
usual, and we wanted to use these to accommodate the fact that the N letter is gonna be sitting

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:31.384
right over top of it.

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:36.722
And where is the intake for these, or rather the exhaust?

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:38.891
We're gonna do something a little bit different on this one.

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:42.895
Just because of the lack of space constraint here, we're actually gonna take one of these

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:47.266
fans and we're gonna use it as an exhaust instead of having all intake.

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:49.869
Oh, I see, okay.

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:51.838
That is an option.

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:56.075
Another option would be to just put some speed holes in here as well, and then just have

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:58.411
it passively exhaust out the rest of the N.

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:01.314
Can we do the speed holes?

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:04.150
Recirculating the air that you just heated up?

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.384
Not that effective.

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:08.888
Man, this is looking awesome.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:12.592
So Tanner, did you realize how big this thing was?

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:15.194
This is gonna take up the whole wall in my office.

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:20.500
Yeah, it's going to take up the whole wall like it would at the front of a store.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.501
Right.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.636
Which makes perfect sense.

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:24.637
Yes.

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:27.607
Here, if you want a smaller NCIX sign, here, take that.

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:28.975
Where'd you get this?

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:32.645
The bottle opener flashlight keychain combo unit.

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:34.180
I got it from NCIX.

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:39.151
Are we about to make a fire?

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:49.762
I know, I know, it's offline, yuck, right?

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:53.132
But come on, guys, it's a lot easier to work with.

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:56.736
We're not gonna see the thing anyway, and it gives us a great excuse to show you guys

00:08:56.736 --> 00:09:01.574
our magnetic cable management clamps that are coming very soon, lttstore.com.

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:06.212
I think that's it, and if we were smart, especially because this is made out of MDF, which gets

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:11.250
completely destroyed by water, we would check to see if it leaks before we go ahead and

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.919
fire it up properly.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:19.325
So I think we can fill it up, what is this, Canadian water cooling fluid, comes in a bag

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:20.326
now?

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:21.327
Yes, sir.

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:22.328
Like our milk?

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:23.329
Yep.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:24.330
Sure.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.331
Hey, there we go.

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.332
There we go.

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:27.333
That's more like it.

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:31.003
Now we're moving some water.

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:34.774
This seems like a good time to talk about our RGB fan controller here.

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:39.679
Oh, but before we put that on, I should talk about our PCIe risers.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:46.085
We could have used a single Gen 4 600 millimeter riser, but you noticed, instead, we used a

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:50.489
600 millimeter, and then we used another 100 millimeter one.

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:52.592
What the heck is up with that?

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:57.263
The problem is that we couldn't find a single riser at that length that had a right angle

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:01.400
connector on it, and we really needed a right angle connector, so we had to use an extension.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:07.006
That means it might run at PCIe Gen 3 speeds, but with this generation of GPUs, that's not

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:14.447
going to affect performance anyway, so hey, riser connector, no problem, we hope.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.550
Come to think of it, there's no reason to stay under there while I talk about the RGB

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.551
lighting.

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:21.621
We can just talk about it here, and then put it down thereafter.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:27.393
Each of our letters already has some addressable RGB strips going all around the outside.

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:33.833
You know, nothing fancy, just a casual 10 meters of RGB lighting, and then each letter

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:41.173
plugs into the next one using these cool JST-SN connectors, or as I like to call them, nice clippies.

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:46.912
You'll sometimes find these on larger string lights, and unlike, okay, that looks amazing,

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:52.518
sorry, unlike those awful standard RGB header connectors that plug into your motherboard,

00:10:52.518 --> 00:10:56.889
these things do a fantastic job of staying attached.

00:10:56.889 --> 00:11:01.293
The only reason that we subbed out Corsair's own RGB strips was because we wanted something

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:06.332
that we could a little bit more easily cut and then route as needed.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:09.568
This did present some challenges.

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:15.174
We're using our Commander Pro to handle the logic, but these lights are a mishmash of

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:21.213
the RGB and ARGB standards, so they're three pins, like ARGB, voltage, data, and ground,

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:28.320
but instead of the usual five-volt power, it's got classic old RGB's 12-volt requirement.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.124
This is for good reason, because it helps with efficiency and getting more consistent

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:38.030
brightness out of the first and last LEDs in the strip, but it means we can only use

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:44.103
the data lines from our Commander, and we need to draw 12-volt power from somewhere.

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:49.075
Oh, so we just used a Molex connector, which is probably, say, what's the power draw on

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:50.076
these?

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:51.077
1.5 amps.

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:52.078
1.5 amps.

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.079
That'll be fine.

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.080
Just fine.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.481
We're not ready to put these on, are we?

00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:56.716
Are we done?

00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:00.553
We should probably do a test boot and make sure everything actually functions.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:01.554
I see.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:05.691
Other than that, it looks like everything is pretty much ready to go.

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:07.693
It was all just a setup.

00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:08.694
Yeah.

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:09.695
For the joke.

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:11.497
It's, yeah, yes, we should do a quick test boot.

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:13.432
We gotta hook up the fans, too.

00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:18.437
I see how we're gonna hook everything up for our test boot here, but have we given any thought

00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:19.438
to IO?

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:20.439
Yes.

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:22.875
All the IO is external.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:23.876
It's all external?

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:24.877
Yes.

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:27.179
Oh, like with a hub or something.

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:28.814
Yeah, you're gonna have one of these.

00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:29.815
Ah, yes.

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:30.816
Okay.

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:34.487
Thanks for our sponsor, Ugreen, who didn't sponsor this video, but they do sponsor things

00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:35.488
occasionally.

00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:37.957
A power button.

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:38.958
Your keys right now.

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:39.959
Oh, good.

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:40.960
Good.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.961
There will be one.

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:42.962
There will be one.

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:43.963
We'll get it figured out.

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:49.769
We got letters.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.471
Is the pump running, though?

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:53.472
Oh, wow.

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:55.074
Yeah, no, it just has all the bubbles out of it. Wow.

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:56.642
Fantastic.

00:12:56.642 --> 00:12:57.643
Oh, hey.

00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:00.479
Nice.

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:03.482
Oh, that's good to see.

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:04.483
Yes.

00:13:04.483 --> 00:13:05.484
Yay.

00:13:05.484 --> 00:13:06.485
All right.

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:07.953
How about Expo?

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.098
It's really big.

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:20.099
Yeah.

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:23.502
Oh, this is a good opportunity for you guys to check out the back.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:24.937
We cable managed some stuff.

00:13:24.937 --> 00:13:27.206
Here, Justin, we can put it down for a sec.

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:28.207
Oh, yeah.

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:29.208
Oh, yeah.

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.209
It's heavy.

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:32.912
This is also my first look at how we're handling cable management.

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:35.848
Everything is going to be coming out of here.

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:36.849
Neat.

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:37.850
Neat.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.086
Where'd that USB-C connector go?

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:42.354
Oh, look at that.

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:43.355
It's right there.

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:44.356
Yeah.

00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:45.357
Oh, cool.

00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:48.594
And if you look, we've used this gap, which is about three inches off the wall, not just

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:53.132
for bottom-mounted I.O., but also to have some room for our intake fans.

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:54.133
Wow.

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:56.702
This is not going to be easy.

00:13:56.702 --> 00:13:57.703
No.

00:13:57.703 --> 00:13:59.071
It's really heavy.

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:00.072
Yes.

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:04.176
Speaking of heavy, you guys probably noticed these handy-dandy handles.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.177
That's how we're going to mount it.

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:08.914
We're going to lift up the ceiling tile, and then we're going to hang it over this partition

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:09.915
here.

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:14.453
The original plan had been to screw it into the wall, but what we realized is these modular

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:20.292
panels are just a piece of sheet metal, some kind of something in between, basically air,

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:21.460
and another piece of sheet metal.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.898
So if we just drilled into this, it would either sag or completely come out and come

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.299
crashing down onto my desk.

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:30.502
We did come up with one idea where we had a backing on the other side, and we screwed

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:36.008
all the way through into that, but I was told that's not aesthetically pleasing.

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:37.009
What's that brick?

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.010
That's your power button.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.479
It sits on your desk.

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:41.480
I see.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.451
I tried to get one of those remote clicker ones, but we don't have any PCI slots.

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:48.821
I feel like maybe I should have specified what I had intended with the power button, but

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:49.822
you know what?

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:50.823
We're doing great.

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:51.790
No, Colin.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.791
You know what?

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:55.794
That's a really good idea, but can we try it this way first?

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:56.795
Justin, how you doing?

00:14:57.329 --> 00:14:58.330
Oh, I'm fine.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.331
Okay.

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:00.332
I've got this, Colin.

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:01.901
If you want to help him, that's probably better.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:02.902
Okay.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:04.870
All right.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.338
So that's on.

00:15:06.338 --> 00:15:07.640
And now I am stuck.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.641
Yes.

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:09.642
Wait, wait, wait.

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:10.009
Hold on.

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:10.643
Don't lift it yet.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.281
Nice.

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.449
That is freaking awesome.

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:20.486
All right.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:21.553
Oh, yeah.

00:15:21.553 --> 00:15:23.689
Man, I didn't need the cable ties at all.

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:24.690
Kind of clean.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:26.959
Uh okay.

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:31.430
Good thing that didn't break.

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:34.166
My Cleveland Browns Lava Lamp.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.001
Did I just say lomp?

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:39.772
Big moment.

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.815
That looks so freaking awesome.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.518
No way.

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:53.752
Oh!

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.254
Hey!

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:56.855
Oh, really, you guys?

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:01.860
It was like that when I got it.

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:03.262
Uh-huh.

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:05.331
Keep changes.

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:06.332
Nice.

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:07.633
You know what?

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:08.167
Screw it.

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:09.168
We're turning HDR on.

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:11.036
Oh, good.

00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:12.037
It looks...

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:12.604
Forget it.

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:14.373
Let's not turn HDR on for office work.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.278
What we do want to know, even for office work, though, is whether our cooling system works.

00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:23.082
It's quiet, but does it perform?

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:27.853
To find out, I'll be running a stress test on both the GPU and CPU for 30 minutes to

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:29.421
see if it can handle the heat.

00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:30.422
All right.

00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:33.659
We've been benchmarking this for a little while now, and the GPU looks like it's good,

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:39.665
but the CPU is running mighty hot, and that is very confusing until you take the X off

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.300
and look at this block.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.270
You might not be able to see it right away, but some of you might be more eagle-eyed and

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:50.843
notice that this edge is much farther off than this edge to the motherboard.

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:55.514
If you look at it through the thermal camera, this thing is just shooting off heat, and

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:58.984
boy, you can really kind of feel it over here.

00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:00.853
It's not a happy camper.

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.222
Our GPU is fine, though.

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:07.159
And that, my friends, is why we run stress tests.

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:11.196
It turned out that the fans on the radiator were hooked up to the Commander Pro, which

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:16.402
was not getting an input from the CPU for its temperatures, so the fans were staying

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:22.674
running at minimum RPM, and after about 15 minutes, we thermal throttled, going from

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:27.513
about 80 watts of power consumption on the CPU to just 30.

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:32.751
Fortunately, fixing it was as simple as getting those fans plugged into the PWM header that

00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:38.657
is on the motherboard itself, and we're back up to 78 watts, which, okay, it's still a

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:40.292
little on the warm side.

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:45.597
In a perfect world, I might throw full, thick fans on there instead of the low-profile ones,

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:49.902
but I will never be running such a long load on this system, and I think I'm just gonna

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:54.273
leave it alone, unless I were to upgrade the rest of the system, like even putting in a

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:58.710
more powerful GPU could dump more heat into the loop, then we'd need to take another look

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.778
at the cooling.

00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:01.513
But that's a problem for the future.

00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:04.683
A future where you'll already know about our sponsor.

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:05.651
War Thunder!

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:10.055
What could be more satisfying than watching huge vehicles get blown up in a video game?

00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:13.592
Well, the obvious answer is watching over 2,000 vehicles get blown up.

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:14.593
It's simple math.

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:18.464
War Thunder is a free-to-play PvP with a focus on realism.

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:20.332
The combat is immersive.

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:24.636
Every tank, plane, and ship is modeled after their real counterparts, right down to how

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:28.307
it feels to pilot them, and the sounds they make.

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:32.377
There's a game mode for everyone, from the casual to the most hardcore players.

00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:35.414
One of the cooler features is the damage X-ray view.

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:39.151
Whenever you destroy an enemy vehicle, you can see where the damage was done, how it

00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:43.188
affected the vehicle, and what ultimately led to your victory.

00:18:43.188 --> 00:18:46.191
And that makes strategizing for next time all the easier.

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:50.095
So join over 70 million players from around the world and start playing War Thunder free

00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:51.797
today at the link below.

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:56.368
If you guys enjoyed this video, why not check out part one where we laid out the plan and

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:58.070
it didn't go quite as smoothly as this.
