00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.710
- [Mr Beast] I built two massive circles

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.100
and put 100 boys in one
and 100 girls in the other

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.020
and whichever circle has more people

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.080
after 100 hours wins $500,000

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.992
but if you touch the red
line, you are eliminated.

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:14.143
- [Boy] We got that!

00:00:14.143 --> 00:00:15.698
- It's on!
- We got that.

00:00:15.698 --> 00:00:17.921
- I'm not leaving.
- I'm not leaving, either,

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:18.754
Woo!
- Woo!

00:00:18.754 --> 00:00:22.530
- It is a team competition,
boys versus girls.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.330
The challenge is officially beginning.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.940
Whichever circle has the
most people in 100 hours

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.030
splits the half a million dollars
amongst their entire team.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.400
- Even if we leave, if our
team wins, we get five grand.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.233
- [Boy] That's sick!

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.695
- [Boys Chant] Boys rule, girls drool!

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:36.360
Boys rule, girls drool!

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.791
- [All Girls] Boys, you suck!

00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:39.400
Boys, you suck!

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.430
(teams continue chanting over each other)

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.334
- Do any of you wanna leave?

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.500
- [Boys] No!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.333
- Nobody?

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.267
Oh my gosh, two people
just stepped... wait, what?

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:48.100
(group groans)

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.990
Don't lie to us, why'd you get out?

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.877
- So I told my girlfriend
I'd go out with her tonight.

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:52.133
- Can we get a simp chant?

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.210
- [Boys] Simp, simp, simp, simp!

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.640
- How are you gonna keep
all 100 girls in here?

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.880
- I got a lot of (growls) in
me so we're definitely gonna-

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.020
- Brute force it.
- Yeah!

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.853
- Woo!

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.970
- Are we really gonna stand
here and lose to the girls?

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.413
- [Group] No!

00:01:05.413 --> 00:01:07.350
- You think if I left during
this, anyone would notice?

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.610
- No, probably not.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.607
Wait, oh my God.

00:01:09.607 --> 00:01:11.130
- No, you are one of us!

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.080
- Take two steps back
so they can't reach you.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.078
Hey, what?

00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:15.690
What is going on?
- [Boy] What are you doing?

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.730
- I can't lose my job
over $5K, I just got it,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.600
I just graduated.
- Oh really?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.790
Hopefully you win five
grand, not looking likely.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.030
It's been 20 minutes and 5 boys
have dropped and zero girls.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.920
It is not looking good for the boys

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.753
and in case you're wondering,

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.770
"How will we know if someone
steps on the red line?"

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.960
Well, we have over 65 different cameras

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.150
covering every square-inch
of those two rooms,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.820
and a team of people monitoring
everyone's every move.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.870
We will know if they're out.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.250
I have a present for you.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.530
He has no idea how to drive
this thing, everyone back up.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.210
- Oh my God, this is not like the Wii.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.702
- Watch out, he's not forklift certified!

00:01:44.702 --> 00:01:45.870
- Woo!

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.610
- You all now have a way to poop.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.717
All right, goodbye.
- Bye!

00:01:48.717 --> 00:01:50.520
- And now he's drifting the forklift.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.320
- Now the boys have a place to poop

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.435
and the girls have a
place to poop, good luck.

00:01:54.435 --> 00:01:58.863
(dramatic music begins)
(clock ticks)

00:01:58.863 --> 00:02:00.660
- My cat is alone in my apartment.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.620
- Food, water?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.600
- She has food for like
three days, but that's it.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.010
- I did not take off work tomorrow

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.090
and I'm going to Chicago on Friday,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.320
I have a flight at 3:00 PM.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.540
- [Mr Beast] So many people
had jobs and family members

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.640
expecting them later that
night or the next day,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.530
which is exactly what I wanted to happen

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.060
and why I didn't tell 'em anything

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.560
about the challenge before we started.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.913
You said you're leaving
'cause you have a baby?

00:02:17.913 --> 00:02:19.611
- I have a baby.
(girls cheer)

00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:21.227
- Someone had to leave
'cause they have a baby.

00:02:21.227 --> 00:02:22.140
It's okay, it's okay.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.970
- We both have to leave tomorrow anyway.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.740
- Yeah, I'd like to still
have a job after this, so...

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.930
- One of the GoPros on the red lines

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.100
caught something interesting.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.840
Gather around, gather around, my children.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.810
One of you got super close to the line

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.950
and you need to decide
if they're out, okay?

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.783
- [Group] Ooh.

00:02:35.783 --> 00:02:36.862
- [Mr Beast] Is that out or in?

00:02:36.862 --> 00:02:38.160
- He's in!

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.276
- Let me play it a couple more seconds.

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:41.400
(group of boys groans)

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.870
He stepped on the line anyways, he's out.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.030
A bunch of girls are leaving
because they're gambling

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.800
on their team winning without their help.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.540
The girls were destroying the boys

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.842
and now the boys are in the lead.

00:02:49.842 --> 00:02:52.504
- Literally, another four just left.

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:55.691
- $5,000 would change a lot
of peoples' lives right now!

00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:57.150
- It would change mine!

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.250
- We're girls, we can do hard things.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.083
- Clearly we're not.

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:00.916
Honey, we left.

00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:02.010
(sad music begins)
(girls laugh)

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.090
- 20 girls are out.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.800
- It sounds like a lot
of girls are getting out,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.090
so that's good news, 'cause we don't have

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.387
a clue how many are left.

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:10.554
(upbeat music begins)

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.900
- [Mr Beast] And now that
we're getting deep into

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.060
the challenge, we brought
them all oatmeal for dinner.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.650
You know, we gotta see who wants it more.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.360
- We're eating this oatmeal on this big

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.440
pile of money right here.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.880
The oatmeal is not good though.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.890
- This oatmeal is psychological torture.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.530
- [Mr Beast] The boys lost
16 people to the oatmeal.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.780
The girls, on the other
hand, only lost four.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.882
- Did you guys enjoy your food?

00:03:28.882 --> 00:03:29.727
- [Girls] No!

00:03:29.727 --> 00:03:31.260
- And I don't like raisins.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.850
- [Mr Beast] And how many raisins
did you have in your bowl?

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.683
- About 20.

00:03:33.683 --> 00:03:36.450
- It is almost dead even, this is crazy.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.180
- We are all so close to each other.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.980
I look to my left, person.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.020
Look to my right, toes.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.040
- [Mr Beast] Throughout the first night,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.080
seven boys and nine girls left.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.390
The boys must have gotten
better sleep than the girls.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.280
- Our goal today is just to be louder

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.113
and better than the boys.

00:03:51.113 --> 00:03:52.447
- [Girls] Three, two, one...

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:56.717
(girls scream)

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.507
(boy scream louder)

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:02.340
- Morning.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.590
These are the troopers that
survived the first night.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.826
Do you wanna know how many boys are left?

00:04:05.826 --> 00:04:06.659
- [Girls] Yeah!

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:07.500
- I'll go count 'em, I'll be right back.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.333
I'm not coming back.

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:10.680
62 of you survived the
night, look at you guys.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.093
Do you guys wanna know
how many girls are left?

00:04:12.093 --> 00:04:13.170
- [Boys] Yes.
- Okay, I'm gonna go

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.070
count 'em, I'll be right back.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.394
I'm not coming back.

00:04:15.394 --> 00:04:17.850
(upbeat music begins)

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.980
I don't know why, but
the boys were actually

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.060
excited for their oatmeal.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.160
- [Boys] Oatmeal, oatmeal, oatmeal!

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.110
- [Mr Beast] The girls, on
the other hand, were not.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.512
- Oatmeal, yay.

00:04:26.512 --> 00:04:27.810
- You're gonna tell me that's good?

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.400
- [Mr Beast] The contestants
were getting pretty bored

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.930
at this point, so the girls started

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.370
creating stuff with the money.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.980
They made a money jump
rope, money hopscotch.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.890
They even made these little money dolls

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.226
and the boys, well...

00:04:39.226 --> 00:04:41.074
(boys cheer)

00:04:41.074 --> 00:04:41.907
- What is going on?

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:44.520
- Mr. Beast, forgive us for our sins.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.830
- [Mr Beast] People were getting
out in all sorts of ways.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.510
Some people got out on accident,

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.070
some couldn't handle the pressure,

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.720
and this girl got out to literally

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.190
save another contestant's cat.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.090
- My cat will die.

00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:57.570
(cat meows)

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.137
- I feel very accomplished.

00:04:59.137 --> 00:05:02.280
(upbeat music begins)

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.787
- Do you know how long
you've been in here?

00:05:03.787 --> 00:05:05.580
- [Girls] 24 hours!

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.950
- Exactly, and as a reward... (claps)

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.885
All right, take your blindfolds off.

00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:11.520
(girls scream)
We brought in Hibachi chefs

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.230
to cook their dinner in front of them.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.531
- It's showtime!

00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:19.230
(girls cheer)
(upbeat music continues)

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.930
- 24 hours on oatmeal and this is perfect.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.190
- You know what I just realized?

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.473
- What?
- We have to feed the boys.

00:05:24.473 --> 00:05:25.830
- For the past two hours,

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.440
we've been hearing the girls having fun.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.700
I'm literally going crazy in here.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.020
- Are you ready for the surprise?

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.510
- [Boys] Yeah!
- Let's do it again. (claps)

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.279
The surprise is now here.

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:36.771
(boys cheer)

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:37.770
- I'm feeling good now.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.880
- I think I'm feeling good.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.830
- Eat your protein.

00:05:40.847 --> 00:05:42.002
(boys cheer)

00:05:42.002 --> 00:05:43.230
(glass shatters)

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.063
- Attention!

00:05:44.063 --> 00:05:44.896
- [Boy] No!

00:05:44.896 --> 00:05:46.013
- Can you confirm that's you?

00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:48.866
(boys groan)

00:05:48.866 --> 00:05:50.760
(boys applaud)

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.410
- [Mr Beast] Since not
much happened on day two,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.660
I let Karl and Nolan annoy the contestants

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.493
while they were asleep.

00:05:55.493 --> 00:05:56.970
- We're gonna give the boys and girls

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.140
a present from each other.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.973
Let's do this.

00:05:58.973 --> 00:06:00.600
- This is a present from the boys.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.130
(loud siren begins)

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.972
Let's get out of here!

00:06:02.972 --> 00:06:04.472
- Is that a siren?

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.475
- That's really annoying, even out here.

00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:10.348
(siren continues)

00:06:10.348 --> 00:06:12.624
- We should go now.

00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:15.325
(girls cheer)

00:06:15.325 --> 00:06:16.596
- They smacked it!

00:06:16.596 --> 00:06:18.018
- I can't take this much longer, man.

00:06:18.018 --> 00:06:19.538
- This is the worst day of my life.

00:06:19.538 --> 00:06:21.297
- The girls already turned theirs off.

00:06:24.366 --> 00:06:27.182
(siren stops)
(boys cheer)

00:06:27.182 --> 00:06:28.890
(funky music begins)
(clock ticks)

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.380
- Morning of day three, it's
starting to stink in here,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.640
'cause no one has showers.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.570
We're still pulling through.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.730
- We have a loss of
insanity, as you can see

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.700
by this Muscle Milk here, our
insanity is entirely gone.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.230
- [Mr Beast] Last night,
this guy told Nolan

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.750
that he has an important
Zoom call for a scholarship.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.610
So Nolan got him a suit and a laptop

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.980
so he could attend the call
from inside the circle.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.316
This seems like a bad idea.

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:49.860
- Start us off by just telling us

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.820
a little bit about yourself.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.320
- I'm an Elementary Ed Major.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.624
- Everyone get in the camera, and just...

00:06:54.624 --> 00:06:56.897
- I'm in a Mr Beast video right now,

00:06:56.897 --> 00:06:58.710
they're all behind me doing something.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.543
- Very committed.

00:06:59.543 --> 00:07:01.650
- What life lessons have you learned?

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.660
- Party all day, party all night!

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.030
- Kevin, you are keeping
your composure so well

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.170
and I'm really proud of you.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.460
- I think he's gonna get the scholarship.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.608
- Bye y'all, thank you.
(boys cheer)

00:07:10.608 --> 00:07:11.858
- Kevin, Kevin!

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.886
- I wonder what the guys
are at, I'm guessing 35.

00:07:15.886 --> 00:07:17.490
What are y'all guessing?
- 20.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.886
- I'm gonna start getting real rowdy.

00:07:18.886 --> 00:07:21.510
(screams)
(girls laugh)

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.560
I might start losing...

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.730
actually losing my mind.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.130
- It's been 43 hours
and they deserve a prize

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.110
for putting their body on
the line for their team,

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.420
which is why I custom
wrapped this blue Nissan,

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.520
hide it in that porta
potty and I custom wrapped

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.401
this pink Nissan that
I'm gonna hide in here.

00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:36.660
I'm gonna take the key and
I'm gonna hide it right here

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.850
and whoever finds the keys
in these porta potties

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.170
first keeps the car.
(car horn beeps)

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.940
But once we got the porta potties placed,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.100
we sat and watched while
people went in and out

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.330
without finding the keys.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.040
- Oh my gosh, she's walking out.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.330
- Oh, no keys.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.470
Oh, the second person went in.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.600
- Literally, any of them could
walk in there and win a car.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.650
- Oh, here she comes.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.630
Nothing.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.280
- [Mr Beast] It was taking
forever for anyone to find

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.530
the keys, so Karl checked
the boys' porta potties,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.180
and the key was actually gone.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.620
- Who has it?
- I do.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.328
- Oh, he does have it, yes!

00:08:03.328 --> 00:08:05.134
(car horn beeps)

00:08:05.134 --> 00:08:07.011
- Oh, my God.
(boys applauding)

00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:07.844
I won't forget y'all, man.

00:08:07.844 --> 00:08:10.330
- And get him five grand to
pay for the gas for his car.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.633
(horn beeps repeatedly)
(boys cheer)

00:08:12.633 --> 00:08:14.790
Then the boys were
convinced that the car key

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.100
wasn't the only hidden
prize inside their circle.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.510
So they started looking.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.608
- [Boy] And we just broke the glass,

00:08:19.608 --> 00:08:21.862
in hopes of finding
something at the bottom.

00:08:21.862 --> 00:08:23.460
- How does it feel to be the most

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.720
destructive person in here?

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.567
- Pretty fun.

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.380
(funky music continues)

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.909
- Everyone in both circles has
officially survived 50 hours.

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:33.219
(girls cheer)

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:34.890
Yes, you're halfway
done with the challenge

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.080
and to celebrate, bring
in the Rubik's cubes.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.390
In front of the girls
is 100 Rubik's cubes,

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.460
and in front of the boys
is 100 Rubik's cubes.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.020
It's a race to see which team

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.000
can solve all the Rubik's cubes first.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.668
Well, whichever team loses,
gets their circle cut in half.

00:08:47.668 --> 00:08:48.982
(girls gasp)

00:08:48.982 --> 00:08:50.790
- I don't even know how to do this.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.710
- Solve the white side and
then he can solve the rest.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.300
- [Mr Beast] We didn't
realize until this competition

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.890
started that only one boy...

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.420
Oh, they're literally handing it to him...

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.197
and only one girl actually knew
how to solve a Rubik's cube.

00:09:00.197 --> 00:09:02.490
Out of all these guys, he's the only one

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.539
that learned how to solve a
Rubik's cube and he stayed.

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:05.372
- Oh, I'm not leaving.

00:09:05.372 --> 00:09:07.470
- And while the teams are
solving these Rubik's cubes,

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.341
I wanna tell you about Current.

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.010
- The first one's done!

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.450
- Only 99 more to go!

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.830
- Current is the mobile banking app

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.210
that's changing how money works.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.220
Old banks hit you with all kinds of fees,

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.960
but Current has no monthly fees

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.580
and is all about saving you money

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.860
and what makes Current different
than normal mobile banking

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.960
is they give you 4%
interest on your savings.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.510
Does your savings account
give you 4% interest?

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.343
- Yes, 'cause I use Current.

00:09:28.343 --> 00:09:29.580
- Oh wait, you actually do.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.600
He actually does.
(Karl laughs)

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.860
Six have been solved.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.919
Eight Rubik's cubes
have been solved so far.

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:34.920
- I'm trying my best.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.197
- The white side needs to
look like this on the outside.

00:09:38.197 --> 00:09:39.360
- 25 done.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.370
- And if you do your direct
deposits through Current,

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.230
you can get your money
two days in advance.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.510
Since the boys were getting
way ahead of the girls,

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.310
I decided to make things interesting.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.540
We're gonna offer the one guy in there

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.030
that knows how to solve them
$10,000 to leave right now.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.200
I love how he's still solving.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.460
We got $10,000 right here,

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.440
you can just walk out the circle.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.273
- [Boy] Do it, do it.

00:09:56.273 --> 00:09:57.570
- I'm out.
- It's 10 grand.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.895
I would leave.

00:09:58.895 --> 00:10:00.589
(boys groan)

00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:02.487
- $10K is $10K!

00:10:02.487 --> 00:10:04.050
- The boys were blowing
you out of the water.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.090
I paid the one guy who knew
how to solve them to leave.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.770
Now, if you don't win,
that was all for nothing.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.603
So win for me.

00:10:08.603 --> 00:10:10.650
- You're almost halfway done,
the girls are still losing.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.557
- [Mr Beast] Current is
helping me give away $25,000.

00:10:13.557 --> 00:10:16.380
100 of you will win
$250, just click the link

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.630
and use the code Beast250 to enter.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.280
Even if you don't win the $250,

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.750
I'm gonna be personally giving you a gift

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.430
to every single one of
you that install Current

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.230
and use this code right
here when you sign up.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.850
So if you haven't already,
click on the description

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.990
and download Current right now.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.640
- Give me another one, I
got it, I can do that again.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.440
- Go faster Zeke, you're making me mad.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.030
- This is the last Rubik's cube.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.230
Bro, he's shaking.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.851
I really hope the girls
just miraculously catch up.

00:10:36.851 --> 00:10:40.590
(intense music begins)

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.010
Oh my god!
(boys cheer)

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.650
Chris, you might wanna move.
- Oh, yeah.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.483
- All right.

00:10:47.483 --> 00:10:48.660
The girls' circle is cut in half,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.090
because they lost the Rubik's
cube challenge to the boys

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.770
and the only girl that knew how to solve

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.510
a Rubik's cube ended up leaving.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.490
Hopefully all of her
effort wasn't for nothing.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.670
- I did 96 Rubik's cubes but I still lost.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.990
- [Mr Beast] With the
third night rolling in,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.690
I wanted to find out which
team would get tempted easier.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.860
- This is an empty briefcase.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.420
I'm gonna put it outside the circle.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.040
Let's see if we can get somebody out.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.750
- [Boy] What do you
want, what do you want?

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.850
- All right, let's go.

00:11:11.693 --> 00:11:12.780
- [Boy Participant] No!

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.973
- I did it, yay!
(boys laugh)

00:11:14.973 --> 00:11:17.730
- The briefcase was empty. (laughs)

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.800
- [Mr Beast] Then Nolan
put another briefcase out.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.633
- [Boy] Oh!

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.010
- Please take your briefcase.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.450
- [Mr Beast] And tricked the boys again.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.810
- And I got cereal.
- It is not nothing.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:28.910
- [Mr Beast] And again

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.760
and again when one boy got out trying

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.214
to grab it without leaving the circle.

00:11:35.214 --> 00:11:38.700
- [Boy] Go for it.
(boys groan)

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.886
- At least you got what
was in that briefcase.

00:11:40.886 --> 00:11:42.210
(boys groan)

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.710
- [Mr Beast] So, of course they tried

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.213
the same trick on the girls.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.210
- [Girl] If there's no money,

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.583
you're gonna look like an idiot.

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:52.200
- Yeah, I am.
- It's an empty briefcase.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.033
- All right.

00:11:54.053 --> 00:11:56.490
The girls are clearly
smarter than the guys.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.640
- It's 1:00 AM, we're
all losing our minds.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.982
- They cut our circle in half

00:12:00.982 --> 00:12:03.634
(girls giggle manically)

00:12:03.634 --> 00:12:04.740
and we're losing it.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.240
- [Mr Beast] I can't
believe it's so close.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.580
After three days, both
teams still have a shot

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.990
of winning the half a million dollars.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.060
It's officially hour 70.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.607
How many girls do you
think are still left?

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:14.773
- [Boy] 20.
- [Boy] 25.

00:12:14.773 --> 00:12:16.830
- 20, so you don't even think
they're in the 30s anymore.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.510
On day four, one of the girls said

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.557
she had a surprise for me.

00:12:19.557 --> 00:12:21.351
- I found some car keys in the porta potty

00:12:21.351 --> 00:12:22.565
and we don't wanna tell the other girls

00:12:22.565 --> 00:12:23.763
'cause we don't want them to freak out.

00:12:23.763 --> 00:12:25.620
- Okay, give me one second.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.815
Here is your brand new car!

00:12:27.815 --> 00:12:29.940
(girls scream and cheer)

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.510
Hey, if Chris scratches
it, it's coming with it.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.110
You don't have to get
out, but whenever you do,

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:35.490
your brand new car's right there.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.005
- I'm definitely staying in.
- Okay, go for it.

00:12:37.005 --> 00:12:39.554
That's dedication.

00:12:39.554 --> 00:12:41.460
I have a podium with a giant red button,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.930
I'm gonna put it in there and say nothing.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.920
Let's see if anyone presses it.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.840
(dramatic music continues)

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.950
- What does the button do?

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.052
- Cuts their circle in half.

00:12:51.052 --> 00:12:52.363
- This is so suspicious.

00:12:52.363 --> 00:12:54.861
- We're playing it cautious,
but we're playing it smart.

00:12:54.861 --> 00:12:58.091
(boys protest)

00:12:58.091 --> 00:12:59.760
- He didn't even explain what it was

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.170
and that boy instantly pressed it.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.196
- All right, gentlemen, do
you know what this does?

00:13:03.196 --> 00:13:04.029
- [Boys] No.

00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:04.862
- It cuts your circle in half.

00:13:04.862 --> 00:13:05.820
- No!
(boys groan)

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.140
- All right, well I'm
gonna go grab spray paint.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.078
Any of you press this?

00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:09.836
- [Girls] No.
- Okay, good.

00:13:09.836 --> 00:13:12.060
- [Girls] Boys suck, boys suck!

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.530
- How we feeling?
- It sucks.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.363
- Yeah.

00:13:14.363 --> 00:13:15.353
- You wanna just clap once for me?

00:13:15.353 --> 00:13:16.186
(boys clap)

00:13:16.186 --> 00:13:17.250
And now the room is painted.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.960
One of the girls convinced our camera guy

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.690
to borrow a drone to spy on the boys.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.640
- We have the controls to the drone

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.560
and we're flying it over to the boys.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.613
Oh my God, dude.

00:13:28.106 --> 00:13:29.387
- Oh!

00:13:29.387 --> 00:13:31.857
- We almost saw into the boys.

00:13:31.857 --> 00:13:34.860
(dramatic music begins)

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.170
- [Man] Look at this dude. (laughs)

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.003
- [Mr Beast] And on night four,

00:13:38.003 --> 00:13:39.630
we decided to let them
cook their own meal,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.690
because tomorrow we'll
get much, much harder.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.800
- We're 85 hours into this
and it's getting so close.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.840
- I don't plan on leaving, there's no way.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.093
- I don't think many of us will last.

00:13:50.093 --> 00:13:52.073
I think the girls are winning.

00:13:52.073 --> 00:13:54.780
(dramatic music continues)

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.460
- [Mr Beast] For the final
10 hours of the challenge,

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.890
we split each of the
circles into 10 sections.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.840
There is now 10 hours
left in the challenge

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.730
and 10 zones in your circle.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.110
So just so we're clear, if you touch

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.250
these red lines, you're out.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.840
And every hour, they have to decide

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.910
which section to block off.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.457
- And I think this one
should be our first choice.

00:14:10.457 --> 00:14:12.090
(girls agree)

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:12.923
- [Mr Beast] Which led to some

00:14:12.923 --> 00:14:14.421
pretty interesting conversations.

00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:15.904
- We can fit nine in the porta potties,

00:14:15.904 --> 00:14:17.271
so we can get real close.

00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:19.170
- All right, boys, oh,
have you already decided?

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.100
- [Boy] We picked so quickly.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.474
- [Boy] Yeah, we're blocking this off.

00:14:21.474 --> 00:14:23.073
- Final decision?

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.449
- This one?
- Okay.

00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:27.210
(dramatic music continues)

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.280
- The fact that it's
dead even after 90 hours

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.190
is so statistically improbable,
that it's crazy to me.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.620
It's been an hour boys,
which one are we filling in?

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.510
Wait, the money pit?

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.240
They seem very confident and
they didn't seem on board.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.433
- That side.
- Okay.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.893
- It's time.

00:14:42.893 --> 00:14:43.726
- [Girl] That one!

00:14:44.643 --> 00:14:47.340
- Boys, what am I spray painting?

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.310
- [Boys] No more pit, no more pit.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.600
- [Mr Beast] With only four hours left,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.530
the teams were going over

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.570
how to best use the remaining space.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.957
- There's no way we can
eliminate the money pit.

00:14:55.957 --> 00:14:58.430
- It's the money pit or the porta potty.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.170
- If we come... if we do
this, and then we just

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.670
cut it down, we have
more than enough room.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.230
- [Mr Beast] Then this happened.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.820
- Boys, boys, boys.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.320
Change the lights.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.000
I think you can guess what this means.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.882
You'll see a finger drag across

00:15:11.882 --> 00:15:13.260
(boys groan)
the red line.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.000
Xavier, you clearly touched it.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.340
Not only did Xavier get
out, this guy right here,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.860
after he stepped out of the porta potty.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.147
Look at all your reactions afterwards.

00:15:22.147 --> 00:15:23.793
There's actually a third.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.280
Who is that, good sir?

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.870
Come here, good sir, I'm sorry about that.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.520
Boys, salute!

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.900
- We're losing people
'cause we're being sloppy.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.300
If we cut that out, then we're good.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.890
- [Mr Beast] After that,
everyone was careful,

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.930
and made it until the last
hour of the challenge.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.570
It is officially the last hour.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.040
So Chris, get to work.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.500
Well, there's a pile of a bunch
of dudes in a porta potty.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.240
Oh my gosh, how many are in there?

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.310
This last hour will determine who gets

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.210
the half a million dollars in cash.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.864
(dramatic music begins)

00:15:50.864 --> 00:15:51.697
- We're gonna make it.

00:15:51.697 --> 00:15:53.532
- I just hope 33's enough.

00:15:53.532 --> 00:15:55.161
(dramatic music intensifies)

00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:57.607
- [Boys] Boys, boys,
boys, boys, boys, boys.

00:15:57.607 --> 00:16:00.480
(dramatic music intensifies)

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.323
- [Boys] We will win!

00:16:02.323 --> 00:16:05.520
- Ladies and gentlemen, the
challenge is officially over.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.068
Meet me in the middle of the dome.

00:16:07.068 --> 00:16:08.714
(boys cheer)

00:16:08.714 --> 00:16:10.096
- [Boy] Let's go!

00:16:10.096 --> 00:16:12.840
(girls scream and cheer)

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.620
- When we started, we had 100
girls and we had 100 boys.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.910
These are all that remain.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.842
After 100 hours, we have
33 boys and 35 girls.

00:16:21.842 --> 00:16:24.425
(girls scream)

00:16:25.962 --> 00:16:29.139
- [Girls] Girls, girls,
girls, girls, girls, girls.

00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:32.281
- Congratulations, they just
won half a million dollars.

00:16:32.281 --> 00:16:33.891
- 35.

00:16:33.891 --> 00:16:34.880
Two people.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.694
- My friend's gonna be so proud of me.

00:16:38.694 --> 00:16:40.380
- If you haven't already subscribed,

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.120
we're closing in on
100 million subscribers

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.953
and it would mean the world to me.

00:16:42.953 --> 00:16:43.821
Should they subscribe?

00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:44.654
- [Girls] Yeah!

00:16:44.654 --> 00:16:46.380
- I really wanna hit 100 million,

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.414
hit it if you haven't already.
