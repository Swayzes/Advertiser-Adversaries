00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.306
When I was a kid, they had a special room in the school for kids like me, who wanted to learn about computers.

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.907
But then suddenly, poof!

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:11.344
Out goes the computer lab, and in comes these things.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:16.383
Google's partners have sold 100 million Chromebooks in the last three years.

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.852
A hundred million!

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:23.990
Though, it kind of makes sense when you consider how many of these devices are purchased by schools,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.395
or by parents who were forced to buy them by schools.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.498
But it may not just be schools in the future.

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:34.300
Come think of it, with that many of them out there,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.938
there may be one in your house right now, and you better get used to it.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:43.977
Because Google has made their Linux-based OS so polished over the years,

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:46.713
that these students are growing up with an experience that

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.420
may just be good enough for them to not think of this as a Chromebook, but just as their laptop.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.224
Could 2020-something finally be the year of the Linux desktop?

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.094
But dressed in a Chrome costume?

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:05.598
I believe it will, which is probably horrifying to just about everyone.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:09.502
So, let me explain, after a quick word from our sponsor.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:10.470
Build Redux!

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.307
They build fully customizable gaming PCs, suitable for any budget.

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:17.811
Pick your favorite games and see how they perform using their online PC builder.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.611
It's simple!

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.114
Head to the link below and create your new rig today.

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.983
Chromebooks were originally launched with miserable specs.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.719
I mean, even iPhones had more storage space.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.422
Not to mention useful apps you might want to fill it with.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.191
And given their limited functionality,

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.660
not to mention their short commitment to software updates,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.762
compared to a Windows or a macOS machine,

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:39.265
it's no wonder that people saw the first Chromebooks for what they were.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.800
Underpowered junk.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.036
But Google's been playing a long game.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:47.173
Something that Softpedia recognized way back in 2015 when they said,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.578
Microsoft is engaged in a silent war and is losing.

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.813
Just four years after being introduced,

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:56.883
Chromebooks were slowly eating up market share.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:59.119
Not at home, but in schools.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.654
Which, I mean, kind of makes sense.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:04.557
Most students, especially below the college level,

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:09.996
only really need email, a web browser, and the Google productivity suite.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:13.500
And getting the schools on board was easy due to the cost.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.971
The cheapest iMac, which is what many schools used to have in their computer labs,

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.773
is over $1,200 now.

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:23.042
So, let me see.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:26.212
I can have 30 of these, and they don't even move.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.882
Or I can have 150 of these.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:30.717
Tough call.

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:34.554
Google also helped the schools manage these enormous fleets of machines

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:38.691
by investing heavily in administrative tools for the Google workspace environment.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.895
Account management, shared access to files and storage,

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.596
support for group collaboration.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:46.933
These have all made it easy to adopt the Google ecosystem.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:51.037
And that's even ignoring the general ease of use and convenient cloud synchronization.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.707
So, in this way, Google's kind of the pusher,

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.810
giving kids their first hit, hooking them while they're young.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.613
If you think about it, do you know anyone who buys an iPhone

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:04.450
just because they already have an iPhone and they just need a new one?

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.319
Familiarity is king.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.987
But come on, Linus!

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.022
I can hear you saying,

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:12.792
I mean, how does any of that help with this supposed long game

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:15.595
if Chromebooks are still underpowered e-waste?

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.096
Well, that's the thing.

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:21.501
Google recognized that problem, and this is the fix.

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:27.273
Chromebook Plus promises a new minimum standard for Chromebook devices,

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:31.578
delivering improved performance, powerful included software,

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:34.380
and longer support, up to 10 years,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.517
all while targeting a $400 starting price.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:41.988
This unit from Acer is right around that baseline of Chromebook Plus.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:46.459
It has a 1080p 15-inch display, a Core i3 12th Gen processor,

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.230
8 gigs of DDR5 RAM, and 128 gigs of storage.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.534
And we saw this thing for as cheap as $270 at Best Buy.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:57.971
Now, there are entry-level Windows machines around that same price,

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.739
or in some cases, even lower.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.178
But they make awful compromises on everything from performance to display,

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:08.314
while also running a heavier operating system.

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.117
And by the time you're looking at something running Windows

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:12.852
with a 1080p display,

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:17.657
you could be paying $50 to $100 more for that Windows license.

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:21.661
Well, you know what's not heavy and has no license fee?

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:26.699
Linux, which has always been the beating heart of Chrome OS.

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.502
Just now, it's a lot easier to unleash.

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.707
These days, it is literally one checkbox to enable a Linux terminal

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:38.611
and to start downloading Linux-native software, like Blender.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.882
Just a simple command, and Blender's installed.

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:45.251
Classroom takes about 30 minutes to run,

00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:47.920
with BMW sitting at around 15 minutes.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.591
So, all right, it's not the fastest thing in the world.

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:56.229
But guys, if this was a Windows machine at this price and these specs,

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.597
you'd be very impressed.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:02.635
For about $250, this is very usable for day-to-day tasks.

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:07.106
And in a pinch, as we've shown, you can even do some light, real work on it.

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:08.541
And it's not just Blender.

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.943
Kdenlive is a video editor that works on here,

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:15.415
as well as Audacity, which is a powerful open-source audio capture and editing program.

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:20.553
The list of native Linux applications really is long and continues to grow

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.789
with the help of the open-source community

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.660
and, of course, some corporate players who have played a role as well,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.333
with a huge driving force behind the recent gaming renaissance on Linux being Valve,

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:37.904
who has dumped significant resources into the Proton compatibility layer,

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:42.241
allowing tons of non-native Windows games to be played on Linux.

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:45.912
And, as of quite recently, as soon as this loading bar ever goes away,

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:47.680
even Chrome OS.

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.149
Time for some distractions from my studies.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.385
Let's give it a little restart.

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:53.986
Look, I didn't say it was fast.

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:56.789
This is very slow with screen capture running.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.258
This could be a problem.

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:00.460
I will try.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.797
Yeah, you won't be kick-starting your Twitch streaming career with this setup, I'm afraid.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:07.533
Ooh.

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.969
Yeah.

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:12.638
I'm gonna stop screen recording.

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:13.940
All right.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.874
Yeah, this'll work.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:15.441
Oh.

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:19.045
Okay.

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:21.114
Yeah, I think it's basically just when it needs to

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:23.916
animate quite literally anything, it struggles.

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:24.851
Tried plugging it in.

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:26.552
No improvement.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:27.653
I don't think it's a performance issue.

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:31.691
I think it's more of a Proton translation layer issue.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.494
Let's try something that I know runs a little better.

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:35.194
Holo Knight.

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.599
All right, this is more like it.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:40.299
This is great.

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:41.267
This is perfectly playable.

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:46.038
Let's try a different game.

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:51.377
This is running great, too.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:55.415
Look, obviously, you're not gonna be playing AAA games,

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.151
but within the confines of what the hardware can handle,

00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:01.354
you can use ProtonDB to show what games are natively supported,

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:04.290
you can use Steam Link to remote into a different computer,

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.992
or a cloud-based gaming service.

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:07.360
It's all pretty cool, right?

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.163
I mean, when I was a kid, I would have loved

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:12.131
to be able to play even simple games

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:14.801
and have an affordable device that I could call my own.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.970
And even the camera is reasonably decent,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.172
so is the microphone,

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:21.441
and I don't even have anything too negative to say

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.210
about the keyboard, considering the price.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.779
Now, you might still think that these devices

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.282
are just e-waste, and I get it.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.184
It's not like I'm gonna be switching to Chrome OS

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:33.419
as my daily driver anytime soon.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:35.588
But how many people do you know

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:39.091
who basically use their computer to call Nan on the weekends

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:40.693
or pull up a recipe for baking?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.029
You might not agree with me about this,

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:45.097
but guys, mark my words.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.433
Acceptance for cloud applications,

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:50.136
even heavy ones like 3D modeling,

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.971
animation tools, and video editing,

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.573
is at an all-time high,

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:56.943
and Chrome OS will work its way into the market

00:07:56.943 --> 00:08:00.213
as a daily driver operating system for many people

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.015
after they leave school and join the workplace,

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:05.585
where the onboarding process could be as simple

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:08.054
as adding their work account to their Chromebook

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:09.188
that they already own.

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:11.257
It might not be this year,

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:12.625
and it might not be next year,

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.861
but I see you, Google.

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.430
And I'm kind of into it if it means

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.098
that the year of the Linux desktop

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:21.734
can finally move beyond meme status.

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:24.937
What will never move beyond meme status

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.772
is this segue to our sponsor.

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:28.241
Red Magic.

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:30.943
They recently released their new flagship gaming phone,

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:32.211
the 9 Pro,

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:34.146
specifically engineered to strike fear

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:36.616
into the hearts of the enemy team.

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:39.252
With the brand new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor,

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:40.953
their Ice 13 cooling system,

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:44.390
and a 6,500 milliamp hour dual battery,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.459
it can handle even the most demanding games

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.628
for extended periods of time.

00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:50.563
Plus, with 80 watt fast charging,

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:52.398
you can get back into the game faster

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:54.634
because, come on, let's face it,

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.235
is your team going to succeed without you?

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:57.837
I didn't think so.

00:08:57.837 --> 00:09:00.072
The sleek design features a seamless rear

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:02.708
with no camera bump to dig into your knuckles,

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.411
while the 6.8 inch full HD plus flat display

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:07.179
delivers immersive visuals.

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:09.115
Its 520 hertz shoulder triggers

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:11.350
mean your games respond faster to every press,

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.618
so you will shoot first,

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:15.121
just like Han Solo did before 1997.

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.722
And their game space software

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.391
gives you access to great features

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.293
like customizable controls for each game,

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.594
external gamepad management,

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:22.628
a plugin library,

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:24.163
and you can even pin pictures and notes

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:25.498
to your screen while you game.

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:28.067
So check out the Red Magic 9 Pro at the link below,

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.435
and get gaming today.

00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:30.703
If you guys enjoyed this video,

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:31.904
go check out the one where I went

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:33.172
and bought my son a Chromebook,

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:36.142
or excuse me, a laptop.

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:37.510
Chrome-based folding device?

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.278
What's the term we're using for these?

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:41.981
Either way, they've definitely improved since then,

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:43.716
and I see that trajectory continuing.
