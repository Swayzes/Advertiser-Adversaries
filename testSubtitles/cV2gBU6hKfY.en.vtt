00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.660
- This is one of the dirtiest
beaches in the entire world.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.940
And we're gonna pick up
every single piece of trash

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.810
on this beach.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.640
Starting with this water bottle.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.830
One out of millions of pieces of trash.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.663
- We did it!

00:00:11.663 --> 00:00:12.496
- This will take forever.

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:13.329
[upbeat island music]

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.290
- Bottle me up, baby.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.897
I'm hungry for your plastic.

00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:20.250
- As you can see, this is taking forever.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.480
Oscar, come on in.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.400
This is Oscar, professional beach cleaner.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.500
Is this basically how
you guys clean beaches?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.150
- Mainly, we do the big stuff first

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.100
and then we bring a lot of
people with sifters as well

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.933
for the small stuff.

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.440
- You scoop it into this thing

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.700
and then shake out the sand,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.900
and you got a bunch of trash.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.360
This right here is the first bag of trash.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.610
Hundreds more to go. How
do we do this quicker?

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.570
- We just need more people.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.077
- That seems simple. Can you clap for me?

00:00:41.077 --> 00:00:42.210
[Oscar clapping]

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.975
There you go! All the volunteers.

00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:45.600
(crowd cheering)

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.640
- Okay guys, we're gonna
clean this up using the vice.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.680
We're gonna clean this up. Groups of four!

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.180
Groups of four in this area.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.740
- Part of me wanted to
see if me and the boys

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.300
could clean up this beach by ourselves,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.590
and the other part of me realizes

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.610
that would've taken a year.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.140
- I could've told you that.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.100
- Jimmy!

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.933
- [Jimmy] Yeah?

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.100
The ocean's putting
more trash on the beach.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.080
There's so much underwear in the ocean.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.370
- I'm enacting a new law.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.710
Thou shall not throw your
underwear in the ocean.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.420
- Wait, did you guys
already fill up a bag?

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.253
- Yeah.

00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:11.086
- You guys are better than us.

00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:12.680
They are professionals to be fair.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.263
(upbeat music)

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.310
- After 12 hours of cleanup,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.070
this is what we managed to
achieve, which isn't enough.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.450
Boys, bring it in.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.580
Tomorrow, I'm gonna bring
in 10 times the volunteers.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.413
Tomorrow.

00:01:27.413 --> 00:01:28.246
(record scratching)

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:29.079
(flip-flop squeaks)

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:29.912
- Tomorrow.

00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:30.986
- It's now the next day.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:32.890
(crowd cheers)

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.820
(upbeat music)

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.994
- I'm helping.

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:38.730
- Nah, nah, nah.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.960
- But as slowly as possible.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.609
- Who's more bueno? Mark Rober or MrBeast?

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:43.442
- MrBeast.

00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:44.700
(piano music)

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.350
- Make sure you watch
until the end of the video

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.550
to find out how we're gonna pick up

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.050
30 million pounds of trash.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.030
- Thank you for coming to our country

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.220
and help us with this initiative.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.857
That is really awesome.

00:01:54.857 --> 00:01:57.615
(upbeat music)

00:01:57.615 --> 00:01:59.430
- Right here. Right there.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.200
Stop. He's not stopping.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.033
I'm gonna move.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:04.593
In this bad boy is 6,000 pounds of trash.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.430
And now we have 36,000 pounds of trash,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.030
which weighs the same as
3,000 cats or three T-rexes.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.020
Whichever you prefer.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.030
While I was talking
with some of the locals,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.100
they mentioned that there's
a beach down the street

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.450
that was also very dirty.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.580
So I said Nolan with a bunch of volunteers

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.260
to go clean that beach as well.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.093
There's a whole car bumper right here.

00:02:23.093 --> 00:02:25.740
- There's a car bumper here?
Did this come outta the ocean?

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.120
- People litter weird things.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.800
- What type of trash have
you seen along the beach?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.960
- Most importantly, most
commonly is plastics.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.030
And we see that in every
form on the beach here.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.670
- They ended up removing
12,000 pounds of trash,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.990
which brought us up to a total

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.870
of 50,000 pounds of trash
from just two beaches.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.580
- Check out this power move. Watch this.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.898
Look at that!

00:02:42.898 --> 00:02:44.280
- Is that how you want us to dump it?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.720
- Yeah, dude, I'm taking one for the team.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.920
I'm a team player.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.690
Oh yeah. I don't even have to look.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.770
- There you go, Mark.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.730
- It actually kind of works.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.563
- See?

00:02:51.563 --> 00:02:52.710
- And if you guys look over there,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.050
we're actually getting close
to the end of the beach.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.100
This is what the beach looked

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.180
like at the start of the video.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.580
And this is what it looks
like with like 20% left.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.413
We're getting there.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:01.246
- We're doing it!

00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:03.660
- Unfortunately, between
the ocean washing up trash

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.940
to the beach and rivers
bringing in new trash from

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.000
the mainland, obviously this
beach is gonna get dirty again.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.940
But with your guys' help, we
can stop a much bigger issue.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.350
- We're almost done, Jimmy.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.290
- I know! Four straight
days of picking up trash.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.710
And just like that, we removed
over 60,000 pounds of trash

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.300
from the world's dirtiest beach.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.210
And even though this 60,000
pounds of trash we picked up

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.350
might seem impressive,

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.170
there is sadly way too much
trash still in the ocean.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.630
Two years ago, we crushed
our goals with Team Trees

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.460
and planted 20 million trees.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.470
- And now it's time to do it again.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.200
- Which is why we, along with
hundreds of other creators,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.580
are launching Team Seas.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.460
And for every $1 you
guys donate, like this,

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.710
one less pound of trash
will be in the ocean.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.290
- But what if I wanted
to donate $10, Jimmy?

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.870
- I conveniently have 10
pounds of trash right here

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.730
that is now out of the ocean.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.563
- Boom. Gone.

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:52.396
- You get the point.

00:03:52.396 --> 00:03:55.080
One dollar donated as one less
pound of trash in the ocean.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.180
And I'd like to personally
thank YouTube Originals

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.310
for supporting Team Seas
and helping us fund it.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.920
They're gonna be matching
the first $400,000

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.900
worth of donations, dollar for dollar.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.910
And we wanna remove 30 million pounds

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.200
of trash from the ocean.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.270
- Which is just so freaking audacious.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.880
This only happens if we all work together.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.740
- Half the money we raise is going towards

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.040
funding volunteer beach
cleanups like we did here today,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.410
all across the world, as well as literally

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.330
fishing trash out of the ocean.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.100
- And the other half
will be used for these

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.491
trash-eating robots that
pick up trash 24 hours a day,

00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:30.660
365 days a year, from rivers
that flow to the ocean.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.060
- Go to teamseas.org or
click the donate button

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.087
below this video right now.

00:04:34.087 --> 00:04:36.600
$1 equals one less pound
of trash in the ocean.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.150
Making real change like
this isn't gonna be easy.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.090
Go donate right now and help
us remove 30 million pounds

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.950
of trash from the ocean
before the end of the year.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.223
Let's show the world that
we want a clean ocean.

00:04:46.223 --> 00:04:48.973
(soulful music)

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.063
- What are you doing?

00:04:53.063 --> 00:04:57.883
Get outta here. Go donate.
