00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.250
- [Jimmy] I built the world's
most dangerous escape room

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.130
and if this contestant can
finish it less than one hour,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.110
he wins $100,000.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.400
Level one is simple.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.310
They must escape this room
before these spikes impale them.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.143
I'm gonna head out.

00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:13.230
- Wait, these are actually sharp.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.063
- Too bad.

00:00:14.063 --> 00:00:15.069
The walls are closing in.

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.239
(dramatic music)

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:18.389
- Oh God, there's sand.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.240
- You gotta break out of the room.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.738
Break the brick wall!

00:00:23.738 --> 00:00:24.952
- Get the wall!
- [Chris] Get the tools!

00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:26.160
- Get the wall!

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.254
- This is literally only level
one and they're struggling.

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:29.520
(dramatic music)

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.473
- [Nolan] Jesus, hurry!

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.583
(screaming)

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:34.829
- [Karl] Go!

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.662
Oh my God!

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:37.827
Are you kidding me?

00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:39.180
- [Jimmy] And that was just the first

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.440
of 10 different levels.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.510
They have to find the exit in every level

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.630
to reach the $100,000
before the timer hits zero.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.820
Here's the thing, the
timer's still going down.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.750
- So we need to get moving guys.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.700
- [Jimmy] Yep.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.610
(dramatic music)

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.980
- Wait, be careful, be
careful, be careful.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.813
- Holy crap.

00:00:52.813 --> 00:00:53.993
(Karl laughing)

00:00:53.993 --> 00:00:56.447
- There's a key hidden somewhere
in this room, good luck.

00:00:56.447 --> 00:00:57.280
(door slams)

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.113
- It's not on this clock.

00:00:58.113 --> 00:00:59.100
(rock music)

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.096
The key might be up here.

00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:02.520
(rock music)

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.514
- I should probably check
inside the light bulb.

00:01:04.514 --> 00:01:06.210
(glass shatters)

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.350
It's not in the light bulb.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.183
- Where is this thing?

00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:09.016
- Gentlemen,

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:11.250
you guys see this $100,000 right here?

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.850
In exactly 55 minutes it's
gonna get dumped into this fire

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.710
if you don't take it
off this conveyor belt.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.550
- Where do you put a key?

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.383
Where do you put a key?

00:01:18.383 --> 00:01:20.490
- That's a Jimmy thing to
do is put it in the toaster.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.720
It's not in the toaster.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.590
- Where have we not looked?

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.735
- Give me a boost.

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:24.690
(dramatic music)

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.093
- Is there anything in there?

00:01:28.517 --> 00:01:30.780
(upbeat music)

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.880
- He's standing on Akira's back.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.980
- [Chris] Door's open.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.580
Oh my God, it's Minecraft.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.900
- [Jimmy] This is the Minecraft level.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.910
I wonder if the exit has anything to do

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.560
with the TNT block in the wall.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.393
- We need to light it.

00:01:44.393 --> 00:01:45.450
- Do you actually think it'll blow up?

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.350
- One way to find out.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.850
- I'm saving my checkpoint.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.900
Yo, there's a cave.
- Oh my God.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.823
There's a cave and fire.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.853
- [Akira] There's a bow!

00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:53.686
- I think I figured it out.

00:01:53.686 --> 00:01:54.930
- If you've ever played Minecraft,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.690
you know that a flaming
arrow lights a TNT block.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.490
The second he shoots it, we need to run.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.780
Just run right after you shoot it.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.613
- Okay.

00:02:01.613 --> 00:02:02.446
Three, two, one!

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:05.081
- He missed!

00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:06.090
He literally missed.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.370
- Three, two, one!

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.330
It's hard to aim with it.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.320
Screw it.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.321
- Wait, are you just gonna jam it?

00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:13.154
Oh God!

00:02:13.154 --> 00:02:13.987
- Go, go, go!

00:02:13.987 --> 00:02:15.660
(yelling)
(explosion)

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.860
- [Chris] Jesus Jimmy.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.000
Is the wall still there?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.931
- [Akira] Yeah it's fine.

00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:19.829
Let's go, go, go.

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:20.912
- [Jimmy] All right.

00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:21.745
- Whoa.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:23.340
- Ah, a goat, oh my goodness, hello!

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.480
- [Jimmy] Boys,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.040
welcome to level four.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.450
- Jimmy shut up, there's a goat.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.283
- [Jimmy] Yeah, I know.

00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:30.390
This level looks like they
need to dig out the key

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.950
in the middle but what they don't know

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.300
is the door's just unlocked

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.830
and they can actually leave whenever.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.870
Let's see how long it takes
them to figure it out.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.220
Akira are you just gonna give up

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.450
a hundred grand for a goat?
- No, no, no, no, no.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.160
Looks like we're gonna have to
get this out with a pick ax.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.170
- I think the goats have
something to do with it.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.960
- Akira has lost over $2 million in videos

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.950
and you're not gonna help him?

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.150
- [Karl] I'll help him.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.580
- [Jimmy] They wasted so much
time trying to dig out the key

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.800
that I decided to give them a hint.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.910
Guys.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.430
Just get the key out so
you can open the door.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.390
- Wait.
- Grab the key

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.223
and open the door.
- [Akira] Hold on.

00:02:58.223 --> 00:02:59.056
He said just open the door.

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:01.448
(dramatic music)

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:03.780
Guys it's open, come on, it's open!

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.300
- Welcome to my scale replica of a hotel.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.610
We worked with Zach King
to design this trick hotel

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.710
with tons of rooms in secret hallways.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.390
But Chris instantly cracked the code

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.880
by kicking down the fake brick wall.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.170
- [Akira] Oh, there's a secret entrance.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.393
- [Chris] Oh, is this it?

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.603
- Whoa, this is crazy.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.282
- [Karl] What?
- [Akira] Whoa!

00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:25.240
- [Chris] Oh my God.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.580
- [Akira] There is a
lot of snakes in there.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.716
- [Chris] Yeah, you think?

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:28.549
- [Akira] They're huge.

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.570
- [Jimmy] One of those
snakes is 18 feet long

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.890
and weighs 200 pounds.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.180
- I'm gonna go through.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.470
What? I think we need to stand on this.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.303
Excuse me.

00:03:36.712 --> 00:03:37.831
- [Akira] Did that open something?

00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:38.664
(all responding)

00:03:38.664 --> 00:03:40.670
- [Jimmy] Step off real quick.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.503
Oh, it closed.

00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:43.230
I think it's obvious what needs to happen.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.160
- We leave Akira.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.930
- One of you has to go
stand on the pressure plate.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.640
- Wait, somebody's gotta stay behind.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.620
Who's doing it, me or you?

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.890
- On shoot.
- One and done?

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.213
- One shoot, one and done.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.190
- One and done or three?

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.140
Should we do three?

00:03:55.097 --> 00:03:56.520
- Three.
- Three, okay.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.410
Rock, paper,
- Go, you go, go, go, go.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.520
- [Chris] I didn't lose!

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.353
Oh my God.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.580
- Goodbye Chris.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.930
- Wait, I don't get to come?

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.330
- Gentlemen, welcome to the next level.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.890
Drop the chocolate.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.870
(clattering)

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.070
- [Karl] Yeah, all right.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.570
Why are the thousands of chocolate bars?

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.730
- One of these has a mystery
ticket on the outside

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.050
that will get you out of this room.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.730
And while they're looking
for the mystery ticket,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.630
I wanna tell you guys

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.520
about my new snack company, Feastables.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.050
Which is launching with three flavors.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.850
Original, Almond, and Crunch.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.727
- Crunch is my favorite.

00:04:24.727 --> 00:04:25.620
- My favorite's Almond.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.240
- Oh, no, nevermind.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.950
- They're made with only five ingredients

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.210
but still taste amazing.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.290
This is our Crunch bar.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.390
Tell me if you like it.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.900
- Hmm, that's actually really good.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.160
- [Jimmy] And I'm kicking off Feastables

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.080
with something I've always wanted to do.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.120
10 random bars are gonna
have a mystery ticket

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.280
inside of them and if you
get this mystery ticket,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.560
we will fly you out to compete
for a chocolate factory

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.460
in one of our videos.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.570
And on top of that, Chandler,

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.280
we're giving away over a million dollars

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.320
in other prizes to random
people that buy the bars.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.720
- Dude, I need to buy these.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.790
- It was in here this whole time?

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.960
- Just go to feastables.com

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.860
or click the link in the description

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.060
and buy yourself some chocolate bars.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.466
They're better for you
and they taste amazing.

00:04:58.466 --> 00:04:59.910
- Go, go, go.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.610
- We are now moving on to level 8.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.660
This massive library has
over 1,000 books in it

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.790
but only one opens the trap door.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.840
19 minutes remain.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.280
- Okay, um.
- Time is ticking.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.113
- Elon Musk.

00:05:12.113 --> 00:05:13.230
I don't know anything about Elon Musk.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.063
- Where is he looking?

00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:15.000
He's looking over here.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.833
- How do you know he's looking over there?

00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:17.160
- What do you mean how do I know?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.230
- The direction his eyes are pointing?

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.020
Akira, I'll give you a
hit if you let us burn

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.430
5,000 of the hundred grand.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.270
- Burn it.
- You sure?

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.281
- Yes.
- Hey Chandler.

00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:26.220
- Yeah?

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.427
- Burn five grand.
- Okay.

00:05:30.427 --> 00:05:31.500
That looked like five grand, right?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.730
- Now that that money's on fire,

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.680
I'm gonna point in a certain direction.

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:36.710
- Oh man.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.280
Uh, Elon Musk, Elon Musk, uh.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.113
I can't read.

00:05:39.113 --> 00:05:40.500
- That's a problem. Maybe
you should send Karl up.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.550
- Whoa!

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.990
Yo this one says Elon Musk!

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.890
- [Akira] Grab it!

00:05:45.513 --> 00:05:46.346
- Yoo!

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.750
- You have less than 15 minutes
for a hundred, or 95 grand.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.583
Run!

00:05:52.583 --> 00:05:53.874
13 and a half minutes.

00:05:53.874 --> 00:05:55.080
- [Akira] Okay.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.240
- Akira, welcome to level nine.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.890
You remember in an earlier level

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.443
where you had pickaxes and weapons?

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:04.912
- Goat.

00:06:04.912 --> 00:06:05.745
- I have to go all the way back?

00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:07.046
- You have less than 13 minutes.

00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:10.331
(dramatic music)

00:06:10.331 --> 00:06:11.433
- There's no time.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.020
- If he does not touch this money

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.630
in the next 11 and a half
minutes, you dump it in that fire.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.860
- Like this.
- Yeah.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.159
Oh gosh, he actually burnt it.

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:22.784
(dramatic music)

00:06:22.784 --> 00:06:23.807
(Akira groans)

00:06:23.807 --> 00:06:26.313
- Okay. We got something, let's go.

00:06:26.313 --> 00:06:29.063
(dramatic music)

00:06:30.086 --> 00:06:35.086
(clock ticking)
(dramatic music)

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.670
- This is the final level.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.750
So if you look over there,

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.510
you'll see the 90
something thousand dollars.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.513
You have to make it across
without touching the lava.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.030
Okay. You've only lost $2
million on this channel

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.863
in these videos.

00:06:51.863 --> 00:06:52.696
- Yeah.

00:06:52.696 --> 00:06:53.529
- I don't know where
I was going with this.

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:54.362
I just wanted to bring it up.

00:06:54.362 --> 00:06:55.195
(clock ticking)
(dramatic music)

00:06:55.195 --> 00:06:57.060
- Wait, wait, wait, how's your hamstring?

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.893
- It's fine.

00:06:57.893 --> 00:06:59.419
- 'Cause it's already
cost you a ton of money.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.169
(dramatic music)

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.400
- [Karl] Yeah you're fine, you're fine.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.600
- I would tickle Akira,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.370
but this is a lot more serious for him

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.600
because he actually gets the money.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.830
- And I'm very ticklish.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.170
- Okay. Now the final part.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.174
- Ready.

00:07:14.174 --> 00:07:15.390
(clock ticking)

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.353
- Hundred grand.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.320
Think about.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.027
Oh man, he's doing this pretty easy.

00:07:21.027 --> 00:07:26.027
(dramatic music)
(clock ticking)

00:07:29.155 --> 00:07:30.075
- [Karl] There's the fire right there.

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:32.077
- [Jimmy] Don't push it in the fire!

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.029
- Let's go!
- Congratulations.

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.930
- I did it!

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.770
- I'm passing.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.140
He did it with two minutes remaining.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.400
Obviously that's fake money

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.479
'cause it's illegal to burn real money but

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:41.312
- Oh!

00:07:41.312 --> 00:07:43.200
- The real money is
right here in these bags.
